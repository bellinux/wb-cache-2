There are several {{commercial}} designs of yellowjacket traps but most are baited with <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate.</b> <b>Heptyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> is highly attractive to both Vespula atropilosa and Vespula pensylvanica (commonly known as the western yellowjacket).

50|$|In the West, western yellowjackets are {{the primary}} pests ranging from Washington to California.

40|$|Worker yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) were {{captured}} in traps baited with combinations of an aqueous solution of acetic acid and polyethylene caps loaded with either butyl butyrate, <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> or isobutanol. Vespula germanica (F.) {{were captured}} {{in large numbers}} in traps baited with acetic acid and isobutanol or acetic acid and butyl butyrate. Vespula pensylvanica (Saussure) were captured in large numbers in traps baited with <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> acetic acid and <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> acetic acid and butyl butyrate, and acetic acid and isobutanol. Acetic acid generally enhanced the attractiveness of these other compounds to V. pensylvanica and V germanica. Vespula atropilosa (Sladen) were captured in large numbers in traps baited with <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> or acetic acid and <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> with no apparent effect of the addition of acetic acid to the trap, and they were only weakly attracted to other baits. The importance of acetic acid to attraction of V. germanica and V. pensylvanica to these lures supports the hypothesis that this response is food-finding behavior. The chemical lure comprised of acetic acid and isobutanol {{can be used for}} trapping the worldwide pest V. germanica, with the added advantage of simultaneous attractiveness to V. pensylvanica...|$|E
40|$|Several yellowjacket {{species are}} {{important}} pests in both their native habitat and {{in areas where}} they are invasive. Traps that contain one or more chemical attractants to lure insects inside are commonly used to combat these yellowjackets in urban environments. Usually, attractants are placed within the trap and combined indiscriminately, though {{little is known about}} how this design influences trap attractiveness or efficacy. Here, using the common attractant <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> in combination with chicken extract, we demonstrate that spatial partitioning of attractants results in increased capture of the western yellowjacket Vespula pensylvanicaâ€”a widespread pestiferous species. Specifically, we show that partitioning of these attractants results in increased visitation of yellowjackets to a trap while also leading to more individuals entering the trap. Further, we provide evidence that this effect is driven by the ability of <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> to function as an attractant to the general location of the trap while also blocking the effects of meat extract as a trap-entering stimulus. Thus, our data challenge the current paradigm of combining attractants inside yellowjacket traps, and suggest that these methods can be improved through the consideration of spatial variables and interactions. Our results not only provide novel insight into the mechanisms of yellowjacket attraction, but are also likely to be applicable to the control of other insects for which attractant-based traps are used...|$|E

The western yellowjacket Vespula pensylvanica (Saussure) has become widely established in the Hawaiian Islands, where it exhibits a high degree of reproductive plasticity. Although most colonies in Hawaii Volcanoes and Haleakala National Park adhere to the basic annual cycle dominant throughout this wasp's native range in western North America, overwintered colonies were detected in some years. Polygyny, achieved by adding queens to an established colony, is a likely prerequisite for successful overwintering. The large size of overwintered colonies and some annual colonies (with more than 300 worker sorties per minute from the nest) results in very heavy predation on local arthropod biota. Workers of Vespula pensylvanica take a wide variety of prey at or near plant and soil surfaces. Populations of highly precinctive endemic arthropods may in some instances be unable to recover from such intense predation pressure. Although even local eradication of Y. pensylvanica is not feasible, toxic baiting trials using Knoxout 2 FM in canned chicken bait, with enhancement of bait acceptance with <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> were in many instances effective in drastically reducing yellowjacket forager populations. Toxic baiting was most consistently effective in high elevation shrubland and least effective in forest situations. A protocol is presented for use by resource managers in dealing with yellowjacket threats to native biota and to visitors. National Park Service Cooperative Agreement CA 8018 2 000...|$|E
40|$|We have modeled various soft-matter {{systems with}} {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations. The first topic concerns liquid crystal (LC) biaxial nematic (Nb) phases, {{that can be}} possibly used in fast displays. We have investigated the phase organization of biaxial Gay-Berne (GB) mesogens, considering {{the effects of the}} orientation, strength and position of a molecular dipole. We have observed that for systems with a central dipole, nematic biaxial phases disappear when increasing dipole strength, while for systems characterized by an offset dipole, the Nb phase is stabilized at very low temperatures. In a second project, in view of their increasing importance as nanomaterials in LC phases, we are developing a DNA coarse-grained (CG) model, in which sugar and phosphate groups are represented with Lennard-Jones spheres, while bases with GB ellipsoids. We have obtained shape, position and orientation parameters for each bead, to best reproduce the atomistic structure of a B-DNA helix. Starting from atomistic simulations results, we have completed a first parametrization of the force field terms, accounting for bonded (bonds, angles and dihedrals) and non-bonded interactions (H-bond and stacking). We are currently validating the model, by investigating stability and melting temperature of various sequences. Finally, in a third project, we aim to explain the mechanism of enantiomeric discrimination due to the presence of a chiral helix of poly(gamma-benzyl L-glutamate) (PBLG), in solution of dimethylformamide (DMF), interacting with chiral or pro-chiral molecules (in our case <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> HEP), after tuning properly an atomistic force field (AMBER). We have observed that DMF and HEP molecules solvate uniformly the PBLG helix, but the pro-chiral solute is on average found closer to the helix with respect to the DMF. The solvent presents a faster isotropic diffusion, twice as HEP, also indicating a stronger interaction of the solute with the helix...|$|E
40|$|Mutually {{beneficial}} {{interactions between}} pollinators and flowering plants represent a critical but threatened component of ecosystem function that can underlie {{the success of}} ecological restoration. The management and removal of invasive species may give rise to unanticipated changes in plant-pollinator mutualisms because they can alter the composition and functioning of plant-pollinator interactions {{in a variety of}} ways. In an attempt to incorporate a functional framework into invasive species management, we conducted a large-scale manipulative experiment to examine the restoration of the plant-pollinator mutualisms and the pollination of a functionally important endemic tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha, following the removal of a competitively dominant invasive floral visitor and arthropod predator, Vespula pensylvanica. The invasive western yellowjacket wasp, Vespula pensylvanica, is an adept and aggressive nectar thief of the partially self-incompatible and pollen limited M. polymorpha. A management strategy utilizing 0. 1 % fipronil chicken bait with the addition of <b>heptyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> reduced the abundance of V. pensylvanica by 95 Â± 1. 2 % during the 3 months following treatment and maintained a population reduction of 60. 9 Â± 3. 1 % a year after treatment in the managed sites when compared with unmanaged sites. The large-scale management of V. pensylvanica demonstrated that V. pensylvanica through both superior exploitative and interference competition inhibits resource partitioning and displaces native and non-native M. polymorpha pollinators. Correspondingly, the removal of V. pensylvanica resulted in the competitive release and restructuring of the pollinator community and the re-establishment of the plant-pollinator mutualisms and pollination of M. polymorpha. This research elucidates the competitive mechanisms and contrasting implications of introduced species on ecological function and provides a framework from which future invasive species management can preserve ecological function and maintain ecosystem resilience...|$|E
