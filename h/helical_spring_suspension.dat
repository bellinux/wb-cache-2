40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{methodology}} for the optimum design of composite <b>helical</b> <b>springs</b> with braided fibrous reinforcement {{is presented in}} this article. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is implemented to optimize two conflicting goals: minimize mass and maximize stiffness. Several design variables that have an influence on the mechanical properties of the spring must be considered: the braiding angle, number of plies and the standard design parameters of a <b>helical</b> <b>spring.</b> Design goals are set such as for standard metallic springs: equivalent mechanical performance, mass reduction, and comparable cost. Three different braided reinforcements in carbon, kevlar, and glass were analyzed with the same epoxy matrix. In <b>helical</b> <b>springs,</b> shear plays the most important role on spring performance. Taking into account the shear properties of braided composites {{and a series of}} technological constraints, a range of composite springs was devised, among which an optimal spring was selected for an automotive application, namely to replace the metallic <b>spring</b> of the <b>suspension</b> of a sport utility vehicle.

40|$|<b>Helical</b> <b>spring</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many applications such as machines, and vehicles. When a <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> is under a static load, it is important to know their static displacement characteristic. The common static model for <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> is the Wahl’s factor equation, which assumes all design parameters such as spring radius, wire diameter, helix radius and pitch angle are constant. In this research, several mathematical models are used to the static displacement characteristic of automotive <b>suspension</b> <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> with design parameters.

In this study, the strain signal of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> at different value of excitations is used to study the signals behavior. When a vehicle was driven on any road surfaces, the significant load is transmitted to the <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> to absorb loads. The load values were varied according {{to the type of}} the road surfaces. The signals were analyzed by statistical analysis and frequency-time domain. Signals are classified based on the value of the statistical parameter. The signals are used to predict fatigue damage of the <b>helical</b> <b>spring.</b> From the result obtained, the unpaved road signals consist of higher peak shocks. It exhibited higher statistical value compared to the signals obtained from university road and highway.

For {{mechanical}} reliability design with more random variable parameters, if the parameters are queued with {{their impact on}} the sensitivity of {{mechanical reliability}}, which will be as random variables with relatively high impact, while low-impact will be determined variables, thus would simplify reliability analysis due to the random variable number reduced.

40|$|In the paper, the {{influence}} of support compliances on the stability and the limiting slen-derness ratio of compression <b>helical</b> <b>springs</b> was investigated. To analyze the stability of <b>helical</b> <b>springs,</b> {{the concept of an}} equivalent column was applied and a general system of supports described by three independent compliances was utilized. In the general case, the solution obtained, which describes the critical force, depends on two rotational compliances and a lateral compliance of a transverse shift of the support. The influence of the individual compliances on the critical load and on the limiting slenderness ratio was studied. Simple approximation formulas were proposed to describe these relationships. Key words: <b>helical</b> <b>spring,</b> stability, support compliance, slenderness ratio 1.

40|$|Abstract:- Optimal {{problem is}} often met in {{engineering}} practice. The method to solve complex optimal problem is always studied by people. Springs are important mechanical members {{which are often}} used in machines to exert force, to provide flexibility, and to store or absorb energy. <b>Helical</b> <b>spring</b> {{is the most popular}} type of springs. The method of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> optimization is a typical one which can be used to solving other mechanical optimal design problem. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a good method in solving optimal problem. MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing and is an easy tool for us to simulate the optimization. In this paper, we mainly introduce the optimization of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> based on particle swarm algorithms and simulation in MATLAB. Directed by the theory of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, with the minimum weight of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> as objective function, with d, D 2 and n as design variables, with shear stress, maximum axial deflection, critical frequency, bucking, fatigue strength, coils not touch, space and dimension as constraint conditions, the complex <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> optimal design mathematics model with three design variables and fourteen inequality constraints conditions is established. When the model is simulated in MATLAB the minimal optimal value of variables and the minimal weight of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> can be obtained.
