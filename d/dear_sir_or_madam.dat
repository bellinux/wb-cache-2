60|$|So {{accomplished}} {{a person as}} the reader must have seen at once that I made away with Timothy {{in order to give}} his little vests and pinafores and shoes to David, and, therefore, <b>dear</b> <b>sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>madam,</b> rail not overmuch at me for causing our painter pain. Know, too, that though his sympathy ran free I soon discovered many of his inquiries to be prompted by a mere selfish desire to save his boy from the fate of mine. Such are parents.|$|E

60|$|That was the {{preliminary}} problem I had to solve; I have not solved {{it to this}} day. What am I? I am a great gentleman, walking through the world with dauntless heart and head erect, scornful of all meanness, impatient of all littleness. I am a mean-thinking, little-daring man--the type of man that I of the dauntless heart and the erect head despise greatly--crawling to a poor end by devious ways, cringing to the strong, timid of all pain. I--but, dear reader, I will not sadden your sensitive ears with details I could give you, showing how contemptible a creature this wretched I happens to be. Nor would you understand me. You would only be astonished, discovering that such disreputable specimens of humanity contrive to exist in this age. It is best, my <b>dear</b> <b>sir,</b> <b>or</b> <b>madam,</b> you should remain ignorant of these evil persons. Let me not trouble you with knowledge.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam</b> is a {{collection}} of letter correspondences between Ozkaya and cultural institutions, dignitaries and curators. This is his own paper trail of bureaucracy in (in)action. He has requested that he be allowed to hang the Mona Lisa upside down and re-wrap the Reichstag, among others. Often, the letters do not deserve a response but curiously, they have usually been treated with official but unthinking courtesy, read perhaps but not comprehended—answered and then often passed along the bureaucratic chain.|$|E
50|$|When {{addressing}} a formal letter whose recipient {{is not known}} by name, the salutation of preference is Stimate Domn, Stimată Doamnă (equivalent to <b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam</b> in English). When the recipient is known by name, Stimate Domnule or Stimată Doamnă, followed by the person's last name, is used for {{a man or a}} woman respectively. For unmarried women, Stimată Domnișoară is acceptable for close relations, though this title is falling out of use in written communication and can be considered inappropriate or offensive.|$|E
50|$|The formal form {{distinguishes between}} the {{male or female}} gender of the {{recipient}} {{as a matter of}} courtesy. The male formal salutation begins with Sehr geehrter Herr, while the female formal salutation begins with Sehr geehrte Frau. Both formal salutations are followed by the recipient's academic degree (if any) and the recipient's family name (e.g. Sehr geehrter Herr Schmidt or Sehr geehrte Frau Dr. Schmidt). It is possible but uncommon to include the full name (e.g. Sehr geehrter Herr Johann Schmidt). With an unknown recipient, Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren (meaning <b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam)</b> is used with no variation on this. Due to insufficient functionality of computer software used for mass communication, some companies tend to use more clumsy gender neutral formal salutations (e. g. Sehr geehrte(r) Herr/ Frau Schmidt).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we report two {{experiments}} that test {{a theory of}} adaptation to memory limits. A critical aspect of the theory {{is the assumption that}} people make bounded optimal decisions, where optimality is defined relative to a payoff function and relative to embodied cognitive constraints. The experiments use a no-choice/choice utility learning paradigm where the no-choice phase is used to elicit a profile of each participant's performance across the strategy space and the choice phase is used to test predicted choices within this space. The experiments provide evidence to support the hypothesis that, with practice, participants select strategies that are bounded optimal given limits on speed and accuracy. The experiments also provide evidence against the hypothesis that people routinely offload information processing to the task environment. The implications of the findings for bounded optimal theories are discussed. Cover Letter <b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam,</b> Please find attached a manuscript entitled “Bounded Optimality in a Cognitive Utility Learning Paradigm ” for consideration for publication in the journal Cognitive Psychology.

40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam,</b> My name is David Longman and I {{am looking}} a {{position}} in race engineering, engineering design or race mechanics. Over the last 10 years, I have combined my motorsports experience with formal education to enhance my race engineering design skills. I am currently working as an engineer at Porter's Fabrications, a multi-million dollar manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I deal with complex engineering drawings which require prototype construction and I determine the methods for manufacturing. These methods include laser cutting, bending/forming, machining, welding and powder coating. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte {{with a degree in}} mechanical engineering, physics, a math minor and a concentration in motorsports. Having this vast amount of education has helped me with my problem solving skills and knowing where to look for answers. In my senior year, I designed and built a revolutionary alignment rig for the Formula SAE car. The rigs accuracy was based on the true axis of wheel rotation not on how true parts where machined. This allowed the user to measure toe and camber free wheel or tool defects. Lastly, I used system of conveyor rollers, wheel plates, plumb bobs and corner weight scales {{for the rest of the}} rig...|$|E

However, members of the magistracy are now addressed as [...] "Your Honor" [...] in all states. This was partly to recognize the increasing role magistrates play in the administration of justice, but also to recognize the archaic nature of [...] "Your Worship", and the tendency for witnesses and defendants to incorrectly use [...] "Your Honor" [...] in any event. It is also acceptable to address a magistrate simply as <b>Sir</b> <b>or</b> <b>Madam.</b>|$|R
