5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about four <b>inches</b> <b>across.</b> The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>across.</b> Around thirty small gritstones remain as part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred feet in the air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two <b>inches</b> <b>across</b> the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} test models used screens {{only a few}} <b>inches</b> <b>across</b> and had {{the guns}} arranged almost {{at right angles to}} it, making for a very large tube. Later models were built inside very large Hackbridge-Hewittic (H-H) vacuum tubes, which the company originally designed for use as high-power rectifiers in power supplies. Arthur Johnson, a glass blower who had previously worked for both Baird and H-H, produced the new models. These had screens ten <b>inches</b> <b>across,</b> comparable to monochrome screens of the era. The guns fired upward at about a 45 degree angle. As in the teapot tube, the necks were very long.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} stars {{within a few}} arc minutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various {{multiple}} star catalogues. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star. Most are only line-of-sight companions, but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it. Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giants. The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723". [...] American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 <b>inches</b> <b>across,</b> separated by ten feet. The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 <b>inches</b> <b>across</b> and they were separated by 420 feet. At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.|$|E

500|$|There are two German {{statues of}} saints in wood, about half life-size, from the decades around 1500, {{and a larger}} number of {{miniature}} boxwood carvings. [...] These include [...] "prayer nuts" [...] of superb quality from around 1510 to 1530. These are small wooden [...] "balls" [...] which open up to reveal carvings of religious scenes that fit dozens of tiny figures into a space two or three <b>inches</b> <b>across,</b> and were a fashion among royalty and the wealthy; they were apparently made in the northern Netherlands. [...] They seem to have often been suspended from belts, or formed part of a rosary; others still have copper carrying cases. [...] A trick of technique in making them is that the main carved scene is made on a smaller hemisphere, allowing access from behind, which was then set into the main hemisphere.|$|E

[...] The boat was powered by two single cylinder steam engines, each with a bore diameter of 12.25 inches and a stroke of 48 inches. [...] The stern-wheel was 17 feet in diameter with planks, called “paddles” 14 <b>inches</b> <b>across.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1807 a runic cross {{was found}} while {{digging in the}} churchyard. The cross is 3 feet in length, and 1 foot 9 <b>inches</b> <b>across.</b> The Anglo-Saxon Runic {{inscription}} translates to [...] "Pray ye for Cynibald Cuthburuc". Following {{a meeting of the}} British Archaeological Association in Lancaster, the cross was moved to the British Museum in 1868. A replica of the cross is now on display near the south west door of the priory.|$|E
2500|$|The 1st edition ASL Rulebook {{contained}} {{a chapter on}} painting 1:285 scale miniatures, and the Deluxe Advanced Squad Leader Modules were released soon after Beyond Valor. These mapboards were 11" [...] by 26" [...] and had greatly enlarged hex grids, each hex being 2.2" [...] <b>inches</b> <b>across.</b> The maps were designed {{to be used in}} conjunction with 1:285 scale miniatures, but could naturally be used with the standard cardboard counters and a very brief rulebook chapter gave some additional special rules for using the cardboard counters in the larger hexes. Only two modules were released; the drawback of the larger scale mapboards was that the terrain being simulated had to be fairly close-in, and scenarios based on fighting in these kinds of environments. The two official releases focused on city fighting and the hedgerow country in Normandy.|$|E

2500|$|They {{weathered}} a typhoon off the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, touched in at Rodrigues and Mauritius {{and changed}} course to round {{the tip of}} South Africa (Durban, Cape Town) rather than go through the Mediterranean during the Suez crisis; Brazil (Fortaleza); {{the east coast of}} the United States from New York, then south to the West Indies. They went through the Panama Canal to the Galapagos Islands, where they traded six packages of instant powdered milk, one can of shortening and two bottles of hot pepper sauce for a Galapagos tortoise, 11x11 <b>inches</b> <b>across</b> the shell, naming him Jonathan Mushmouth. (They had a legal permit issued in Ecuador, to take [...] "two of every kind" [...] of animal from the islands.) Years later they gave Jonathan to the Hanshin Zoo in Osaka, Japan, the zoo's first Galapagos tortoise. The Reynolds family expected Jonathan to outlive them but he died in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Trapper: This goalie's {{catching}} glove {{was originally}} shaped {{in the same}} fashion as a baseball glove. [...] It has evolved into a highly specific piece of equipment that is designed specifically for catching the puck. Some of the more significant changes are the use of a [...] "string mesh" [...] in the pocket of the trapper and the substantial palm and wrist protection. The pocket is the area between the thumb and first finger of the glove and is where most goaltenders try to catch the puck; catching in the pocket reduces the chance of a rebound falling out of the glove. The trapper must not be more than 18 <b>inches</b> <b>across.</b> The trapper can be held in a variety of positions depending upon the individual goaltender, but the trend among younger goaltenders is to hold the glove with the palm facing towards the shooter, instead of the [...] "shake hands" [...] position that was popular previously. The [...] "Cheater" [...] portion of the glove is the portion of the glove on the outside area of the thumb and the part that covers the wrist of the goaltender.|$|E

50|$|Universal {{measuring}} machines {{placed under}} corrected interferometric control and using non-contact gauge heads can measure features to millionths of an <b>inch</b> <b>across</b> the entire machine's envelope, where {{other types of}} machine are limited either in number of axes or accuracy of the measurement. The accuracy of the machine itself is negligible, as the environment the machine is the limiting factor to effective accuracy. The earlier mechanical machines were built to hold 10 to 20 millionths of an <b>inch</b> accuracy <b>across</b> the entire machine envelope, and due to incredible machine design and forethought, remain as accurate today without computer compensation.|$|R
