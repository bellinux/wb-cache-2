50|$|Glass frit bonding, also {{referred}} to as glass soldering or seal <b>glass</b> <b>bonding,</b> describes a wafer bonding technique with an intermediate glass layer. It is a widely used encapsulation technology for surface micro-machined structures, e.g., accelerometers or gyroscopes. This technique utilizes low melting glass ("glass solder") and therefore provides various advantages including that viscosity of glass decreases with an increase of temperature. The viscous flow of glass has effects to compensate and planarize surface irregularities, convenient for bonding wafers with a high roughness due to plasma etching or deposition. A low viscosity promotes hermetically sealed encapsulation of structures based on a better adaption of the structured shapes. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass material is adapted to silicon. This results in low stress in the bonded wafer pair.|$|E

This safe drive away time (SDAT) or minimum drive away time (MDAT) refers to the time required until a windshield installation or glass replacement is considered safe to drive again.

Whereas cleaning did not adversely affect the durability of glass bonds, high concentrations of the fermentation compounds ethanol and acetic acid resulted in accelerated corrosion and subsequent bond failure. Moreover, no effect of eight different epoxy and (urethane) acrylate adhesives was observed on selected model organisms Escherichia coli K 12 and Hansenula polymorpha wild type.

The <b>bond</b> quality, residual curvature, and microstructured interfacial features for CVD SiC anodic bonding were shown to be comparable to single crystal silicon (Si) anodic bonding. The Plaza Test specimen, invented by Plaza et al., was used to assess bulk and thin-film, lapped <b>glass</b> <b>bond</b> quality. A two-part contact/bonding model was used to predict the contact and bonding of the Plaza Test structures. Surface contact was predicted by a parallel plate capacitor pull-in model after the voltage was applied, and linear elastic fracture mechanics (FEA) modeling predicted the toughness or work-of-adhesion of the bonded surfaces after the formation of a permanent silicon dioxide bond. The role of the voltage, structure geometry, work of adhesion, and materials used in the model predicted that the bonding mechanism limited the total number of structures that remained <b>bonded.</b> thin-film, lapped <b>glass</b> <b>bond</b> quality improved when increasing the voltage and time. The calculated, experimental, and modeled thermoelastic curvatures were minimal, indicating low residual stress(cont.) between the bonded materials.
