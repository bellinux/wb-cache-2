5|$|In India simple {{artificial}} plant classification {{systems of}} the Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical {{with the work of}} Parashara (c. 400 – c. 500 AD), the author of Vṛksayurveda (the science of life of trees). He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into Dvimatrka (<b>Dicotyledons)</b> and Ekamatrka (Monocotyledons). The <b>dicotyledons</b> were further classified into groupings (ganas) akin to modern floral families: Samiganiya (Fabaceae), Puplikagalniya (Rutaceae), Svastikaganiya (Cruciferae), Tripuspaganiya (Cucurbitaceae), Mallikaganiya (Apocynaceae), and Kurcapuspaganiya (Asteraceae). Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the Prthviniraparyam of Udayana, Nyayavindutika of Dharmottara, Saddarsana-samuccaya of Gunaratna, and Upaskara of Sankaramisra.|$|E
5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the <b>dicotyledons).</b> The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E
5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the <b>Dicotyledons</b> in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E

25|$|The cotyledons, {{the seed}} leaves, {{attached}} to the embryonic axis. There may be one (Monocotyledons), or two (<b>Dicotyledons).</b> The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic <b>dicotyledons,</b> in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and leathery. In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. <b>Dicotyledons</b> have the point of attachment opposite one another on the axis.|$|E

25|$|Six types occur {{amongst the}} monocotyledons, {{ten in the}} <b>dicotyledons,</b> and two in the {{gymnosperms}} (linear and spatulate).

25|$|The GLO/PI {{lines that}} have been {{duplicated}} in Petunia contain P. hybrida GLOBOSA1 (PhGLO1, also called FBP1) and also PhGLO2 (also called PMADS2 or FBP3). For the functional elements equivalent to AP3/DEF in Petunia there is both a gene that possesses a relatively similar sequence, called PhDEF {{and there is also}} an atypical B function gene called PhTM6. Phylogenetic studies have placed the first three within the «euAP3» lineage, while PhTM6 belongs to that of «paleoAP3». It is worth pointing out that, in terms of evolutionary history, the appearance of the euAP3 line seems to be related with the emergence of <b>dicotyledons,</b> as representatives of euAP3-type B function genes are present in <b>dicotyledons</b> while paleoAP3 genes are present in monocotyledons and basal angiosperms, among others.|$|E
25|$|In most {{monocotyledons}} (such as {{grasses and}} palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) <b>dicotyledons</b> (such as castor beans) the embryo {{is embedded in}} the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic <b>dicotyledons</b> the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} to {{classify}} wood as either softwood or hardwood. The wood from conifers (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from <b>dicotyledons</b> (usually broad-leaved trees, (e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. yew) are harder than many hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 {{changed the way}} that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The Darwinian approach led {{to the concept of}} phylogeny (tree-like structure) in assembling classification systems, starting with Eichler. Eichler, having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants (angiosperms) were divided into monocotyledons and <b>dicotyledons,</b> further divided into former into seven orders. Within the Liliiflorae were seven families, including Liliaceae and Amaryllidaceae. Liliaceae included Allium and Ornithogalum (modern Allioideae) and Asparagus.|$|E
25|$|In endospermic seeds, {{there are}} two {{distinct}} regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all <b>dicotyledons</b> and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other Thiaridae, Tarebia granifera is {{primarily}} a benthic species and in South Africa has been collected {{on a variety of}} substrata in both natural and artificial waterbodies, e.g. sand, mud, rock, concrete bridge foundations and the concrete walls and bottoms of reservoirs, irrigation canals and ornamental ponds. Many of these habitats were vegetated and the associated vegetation included many types of emergent monocotyledons (e.g. Cyperus papyrus, Scirpus sp., Typha sp., Phragmites sp.) and <b>dicotyledons</b> (e.g. Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton crispus, Nymphaea nouchali). Where densities are high, Tarebia granifera may also occur on marginal, trailing vegetation and the floating Common Water Hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes as well. It favours turbulent water and tolerates current speeds up to 1.2m.s−1 and possibly greater. This habitat range is similar to that recorded for Tarebia granifera in Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|Grant’s gazelles are {{generally}} mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats {{seems to be}} the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates. This allows the gazelles to survive in the brush during the dry season. Grant’s gazelles eat mainly <b>dicotyledons</b> during the dry season and grass in the wet season.|$|E

500|$|In {{about the}} mid-19th century {{scientific}} communication changed. Until this time ideas were largely exchanged by reading the works of authoritative individuals who dominated in their field: these were often wealthy and influential [...] "gentlemen scientists". Now research was reported by the publication of [...] "papers" [...] that emanated from research [...] "schools" [...] that promoted the questioning of conventional wisdom. This process had started in the late 18th century when specialist journals began to appear. Even so, botany was greatly stimulated {{by the appearance of}} the first [...] "modern" [...] textbook, Matthias Schleiden's (1804–1881) , published in English in 1849 as Principles of Scientific Botany. By 1850 an invigorated organic chemistry had revealed the structure of many plant constituents. Although the great era of plant classification had now passed the work of description continued. Augustin de Candolle (1778–1841) succeeded Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu in managing the botanical project [...] (1824–1841) which involved 35 authors: it contained all the <b>dicotyledons</b> known in his day, some 58000 species in 161 families, and he doubled the number of recognized plant families, the work being completed by his son Alphonse (1806–1893) in the years from 1841 to 1873.|$|E
500|$|Theophrastus's major botanical {{works were}} the Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) and Causes of Plants (Causae Plantarum) which were his lecture notes for the Lyceum. The opening {{sentence}} of the Enquiry {{reads like a}} botanical manifesto: [...] "We must consider the distinctive characters and the general nature of plants {{from the point of}} view of their morphology, their behaviour under external conditions, their mode of generation and the whole course of their life". The Enquiry is 9 books of [...] "applied" [...] botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany, examining the techniques of agriculture (relationship of crops to soil, climate, water and habitat) and horticulture. He described some 500 plants in detail, often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution, and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern-day plant families. Some names he used, like Crataegus, Daucus and Asparagus have persisted until today. His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction (akin to modern physiology). Like Aristotle he grouped plants into [...] "trees", [...] "undershrubs", [...] "shrubs" [...] and [...] "herbs" [...] but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations. He noted that plants could be annuals, perennials and biennials, they were also either monocotyledons or <b>dicotyledons</b> and he also noticed the difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals, position of the ovary and more. These lecture notes of Theophrastus comprise the first clear exposition of the rudiments of plant anatomy, physiology, morphology and ecology — presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries.|$|E

50|$|The kingdom {{indicated}} {{this species}} is a plant. The subkingdom implies that this species is a vascular plant: It has {{a system of}} tissues (roots, leaves, and stems) allowing food and water to travel. The superdivision is the classification for seed plants, and the division categorizes the capa rose as a flowering plant. The class indicates the species to be a <b>dicotyledon.</b> The embryo inside each seed produces leaves, or cotyledons, when germinated. This species produces two leaves, thus <b>dicotyledon.</b> The most common characteristic of the subclass of this species is the tight cluster of individual flowers, showing the appearance of one larger flower. The order indicates that the capa rose has opposite, or pairs of symmetrical, leaves. The family is almost all tropical plants with clustered flowers, most native to the western hemisphere. The genus classifies this flower as a beautyberry.|$|R
