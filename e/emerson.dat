5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin <b>Emerson,</b> Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (<b>Emerson</b> had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that <b>Emerson</b> was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. <b>Emerson</b> used the map and it is believed by some that he may have given the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Emerson</b> {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found <b>Emerson</b> in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, <b>Emerson</b> decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E

5|$|These early knives {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped <b>Emerson</b> gain status and {{credibility as a}} custom knifemaker.

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek.

When he was released, <b>Emerson</b> helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly.
