40|$|Rebreather divers use LED-based head-up {{displays}} (HUD) as {{a primary}} <b>display</b> <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> device for the partial pressure of O- 2 in the breathing loop. Such devices are usually mounted on the mouthpiece of the rebreather {{in the field of}} vision of the diver. LED-based HUDs are simple devices and can be designed so that they are easy to understand but have limited information content. Few alphanumeric or graphical screen-based HUDs have been developed in the past. Connecting such a device to a rebreather requires cable links, which divers dislike, and increases the risk of entanglement. State-of-the-art wireless data transmission uses ultrasonic waves or low- frequency electromagnetic waves the former is not silent, and the latter achieves only very low data transmission rates of a few bytes per second and does not meet the antimagnetic standards required by military divers. The present paper describes a novel HUD system that incorporates a simple LED-based primary HUD along with an advanced secondary head-up diving computer with a micro organic LED screen. An optical infrared data transmission system is used to transmit all rebreather relevant data from the primary to the secondary device. One prototype of the system was manufactured and successfully tested in the laboratory according to relevant European standards as well as during several dives in fresh and sea water...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Drilling is a {{response}} to todays complex petroleum drilling operations. The strategy entails more automation, changed work procedures and roles, improved measurement and control data and more integrated and optimized planning procedures. The increased amount of available data combined with increasingly narrower parameter margins introduce a need for advanced visualization methods and tools. The objectives are to fully understand the consequences of our actions and to react as quickly as possible to changed conditions. The methods and tools presented in this thesis aim to achieve these goals. A domain model of a subset of the drilling operations suitable for visualization purposes was created using an informal literature study. A set of User Interaction Design (UID) principles for designing mission-critical systems was assembled by combining the knowledge of the domain model with established UID principles from literature. Based on the domain model, a simulation model was created to support time- and depth-based simulation of drilling operations and events. This simulation model uses a discrete-event model for communicating events for advancing time and depth, starting stuck pipe and kick behavior, <b>display</b> <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> of stuck pipe and kick events and display of wellbore information and risks for specified depth intervals. A prototype visualization tool that implements the simulation and event model was constructed using the engineering research method. The tool displays the entire drilling parameter value lifecycle including roadmap, measured sensor values and user-editable set points in an integrated view. The tool provides an integration of parameter data that was previously scattered and gives the user a coherent view that allows for better parameter optimization. The tool features an unobtrusive early warning alarm system that highlights abnormal parameter values and predicts critical events. Finally, an evaluation of the visualization tool was conducted using an expert heuristic review of the user interface, an assertion that the tool was suitable for the drilling scenarios and a simulation of the drilling process using generated parameter values and trends, manually scheduled stuck pipe and kick events and an example set of information and risks from a trip risk log. The assertion and simulation concluded that the tool provided complete coverage of the scenarios and accurately modeled the subset of the drilling process. The expert heuristic review concluded that the visualization method presented was useful, although the interaction method of adjusting the set points was not likely to be of use. The visualization method was also believed to be more useful for a data logging user role, such as that of the mud logger...|$|E

30|$|The {{use case}} we {{selected}} for evaluating our architecture {{is related to}} road traffic and road condition monitoring in the Finnish highway network. The Finnish highway network has nearly 10, 000 kilometers of road. If monitoring units consisting of equipment to monitor traffic and weather conditions are deployed on highways for instance on the average every five kilometers, the resulting system has 2, 000 monitoring units. With an average distance of one kilometer, there would be 10, 000 monitoring units. We further assume that these units, which act as PNs, are equipped with 3 G HSDPA modules. The monitoring units are coupled with variable speed limit <b>displays</b> <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> <b>displays</b> {{that are used to}} show information to the users of the road. Every monitoring unit acts as a PN for 1 - 100 wireless sensors (LNs) in a local WSN. The sensors are used for monitoring various conditions such as road surface temperature (to detect ice formation), air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidity, light, the amount of chemicals applied for prevention of freezing of water, water layer thickness, black ice, traffic volume, speed of vehicles (e.g., using a radar), and accidents (e.g., using video cameras coupled with computer vision). The data from the sensors can be used to adjust the current speed limit <b>and</b> show <b>warnings</b> to the users of the road on the warning displays. We assume that a given monitoring unit uses not only local information but information from sensors in nearby WSNs as input for showing <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> for determining an appropriate speed limit to optimize the flow of traffic. For this, every monitoring unit is assumed to have on the average 10 outgoing CoAP observation relationships. The mean time between notifications is assumed to be either 1 min or 10 min.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examined}} the effects of different forms of automation invocation, the reconfiguration of the task <b>display</b> when automated, <b>and</b> the influence of the specific modality that warned of the manual/automation transition on operator perfor-mance. Thirty-two experienced pilots engaged in a multiple-task situation consisting of tracking, monitoring, and fuel management subtasks, representative of typical aviation demands. Automation of the tracking task could be invoked in four different ways: 1) system-initiated automation (SIA); 2) pilot command by nega-tion (PCN); 3) pilot command by initiation (PCI); and 4) pilot-initiated automation (PIA). Pilots were warned of the mode change between manual and automated controls by either a visual, an au-ral, or a combined visual and aural cue. The display of the subtask while in automation was reduced in size and placed either in a cen-tral or peripheral location. Results indicated that SIA had a dif-ferential effect on tracking performance as compared to all other forms of automation invocation. The respective location of the automated display had it effects in the fuel management subtask, whereas monitoring capability remained stable across manipu-lations. A significant three-way interaction between invocation procedure, <b>display</b> location, <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> modality illustrated the selective disadvantage of the visual warning combined with the central location under the PCI procedure on tracking response. Measures of subjective response suggested that visual warning modality was slightly more taxing than either an auditory or a combined auditory <b>and</b> visual <b>warning.</b> Pilots also experienced elevated fatigue when the system initiated the automation. These results confirm that both performance and subjective perception of multitask demand are greater when the system controls the op-tion to automate. A qualitative model is presented, which provides an approach for the integrated assessment of human performance with adaptive systems.
