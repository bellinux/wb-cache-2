This adaptation to a high-grain diet from a high-forage diet is known to change the rumen microbial population structure and help establish a stable microbial population within the rumen. Therefore, to evaluate bacterial population dynamics during adaptation to a high-grain diet, 4 ruminally cannulated beef steers were adapted to a high-grain diet using a step-up diet regimen containing grain and hay at ratios of 20 : 80, 40 : 60, 60 : 40, and 80 : 20. The rumen bacterial populations were evaluated at each stage of the step-up diet after 1 week of adaptation, before the steers were transitioned to {{the next stage of}} the diet, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>libraries,</b> and quan-titative real-time PCR.

40|$|Abstract — As viruses {{become more}} complex, {{existing}} anti-virus methods are inefficient to detect {{various forms of}} viruses, especially new variants and unknown viruses. Inspired by immune system, a hierarchical artificial immune system (AIS) model, {{which is based on}} matching in three layers, is proposed to detect a variety of forms of viruses. In the bottom layer, a non-stochastic but guided candidate virus <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> is generated by statistical information of viral key codes. Then a detecting virus <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> is upgraded from the candidate virus <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> using negative selection. In the middle layer, a novel storage method is used to keep a potential relevance between different signatures on the individual level, by which the mutual cooperative information of each instruction in a virus program can be collected. In the top layer, an overall matching process can reduce the information loss consider-ably. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can recognize obfuscated viruses efficiently with an averaged recognition rate of 94 %, including new variants of viruses and unknown viruses.

40|$|Abstract One gram of soil is {{an immense}} bio-chemical <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> {{producing}} diverse genetic instructions, {{which have been}} present for almost 4 billion years on the Earth. There is sufficient DNA in 1 g of soil to extend 1, 598 km. However, this is certainly an underestimate for fertile soils. Can the amount of genetic information contained in one g of soil be accurately estimated? The answer is not always definitive as the estimate depends on the particular g of soil being researched and the methods for DNA extraction, purification and quantification. Moreover, {{there is no such}} entity as a typical or average g of soil. Extraction of DNA from soil samples is never 100 % efficient and can vary from a few lg to almost 200 lg DNA per g dry weight soil. However, estimates can be made that lead {{to a better understanding of}} the immense biochemical <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> and gene expression (combined transcription and translation) in microorganisms within a single g of soil. Accurate estimates of genes expressed in a single g of soil under a multitude of changing, environmental, conditions still requires considerable research. In this article, soil as a biochemical <b>gene</b> <b>library,</b> gene expression, and the minimal number of genes for the first bacteria in the environment will be examined...|$|E

40|$|K-shuff {{is a new}} {{algorithm}} {{for comparing}} the similarity of <b>gene</b> sequence <b>libraries,</b> providing measures of the structural and compositional diversity {{as well as the}} significance of the differences between these measures. Inspired by Ripley's K-function for spatial point pattern analysis, the Intra K-function or IKF measures the structural diversity, including both the richness and overall similarity of the sequences, within a library. The Cross K-function or CKF measures the compositional diversity between <b>gene</b> <b>libraries,</b> reflecting both the number of OTUs shared as well as the overall similarity in OTUs. A Monte Carlo testing procedure then enables statistical evaluation of both the structural and compositional diversity between <b>gene</b> <b>libraries.</b> For 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>libraries</b> from complex bacterial communities such as those found in seawater, salt marsh sediments, and soils, K-shuff yields reproducible estimates of structural and compositional diversity with libraries greater than 50 sequences. Similarly, for pyrosequencing libraries generated from a glacial retreat chronosequence and Illumina® libraries generated from US homes, K-shuff required > 300 and 100 sequences per sample, respectively. Power analyses demonstrated that K-shuff is sensitive to small differences in Sanger or Illumina® libraries. This extra sensitivity of K-shuff enabled examination of compositional differences at much deeper taxonomic levels, such as within abundant OTUs. This is especially useful when comparing communities that are compositionally very similar but functionally different. K-shuff will therefore prove beneficial for conventional microbiome analysis as well as specific hypothesis testing...|$|R

40|$|Human {{immunology}} {{has been}} a source of inspiration for many new innovative applications; the most famous one being the adoption of concepts from immunology to what is known as Artificial Immune System (AIS). Finding the applications of AIS to be most relevant in the field of computer security, here in this report we give a detailed introduction of human immune system and its mapping to artificial immune system and further illustrate how one can model a network based IDS using it. The system is basically responsible for maintaining a good artificial lymphocyte (ALC or more specifically a detector) population so that it can match as many as possible foreign patterns. This need caters to a large extent to the demands we have in an intrusion detection system, i. e. the need to identify attacks that are foreign to the system. The original work in this report is that of maintaining <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> to aid in effective detector generation. We propose a structure for the <b>gene</b> <b>library</b> and the ways to update it from time to time. Further we explain the process of generating new detectors from this structured <b>gene</b> <b>library.</b> These detectors have been expected to have a longer life with a better probability to come through the negative selection stage, and are an attempt at reduction of detector generation retries.

However, the comparison between deeper levels, such as order and genus, showed that the richness between both libraries is similar, although the groups found were different. Probably, these differences {{can be explained by}} the bias inherent to each method, e.g. pyrosequencing and 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>library,</b> used to survey the bacterial diversity. Nonetheless, in this case, the data obtained using both approaches can be considered complementary in order to depict a bacterial diversity scenario of the phenol degrading sludge.|$|E
