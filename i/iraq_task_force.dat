50|$|As the war progressed {{into the}} {{offensive}} stage, the 1st Cavalry Division’s mission changed {{in order to}} support the impending invasion of Iraq. In mid-February 1991, prior to the ground invasion of Iraq, the division fought the Battle of Ruqi Pocket, a critical feint designed to make the enemy believe that the main coalition ground attack would occur at the Wadi al-Batin region of the Iraq-Saudi border. On 15 February 1991, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Berm Buster, where they breached the defensive berm between Saudi Arabia and Iraq to feign the initial stages of a ground invasion. Later that night, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Red Storm, an artillery and aviation barrage of Iraqi border targets designed to suggest that the area was being prepped for assault. On 19 February, the 2nd Brigade’s <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 1-5 Cav conducted Operation Knight Strike, a reconnaissance in force through the Wadi al-Batin, becoming the first coalition unit to enter <b>Iraq.</b> The <b>task</b> <b>force</b> suffered 12 casualties, but successfully accomplished its mission of simulating the reconnaissance efforts for an impending invasion. The feints at the Wadi al-Batin allowed VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps to stage themselves to the far west in preparation for the actual invasion on G-Day, 24 February 1991.

[...] In October 2004, all SAS personnel in <b>Iraq</b> including <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Black were banned from handing over suspects to the US forces if the suspects {{were going to be}} taken to a US interrogation center, because of the bad reputation of the centers.

In 2007, when JSOC began conducting CII (Counter Iranian Influence) missions, the UK government ordered that Iranian nationals should not be taken by <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> Knight and they excluded them from certain intelligence gathering missions measures being taken to prepare for possible strikes against Iran.

They also found critical documents: one was a report on the Karbala raid which identified Azhar al-Dulaimi as being responsible for it, he was eventually killed by US forces; the Karbala memo also indicated that Iran's Quds Force was approved the attack. there were Memos to about attacks on British forces in Basra and large financial payments based on performance against the coalition, Daqduq revealed that he had been brought into Iraq by Quds Force leadership to be a sort-of insurgent management consultant. He also revealed that the Shia Special Groups gave reports of IED attacks and indirect fire to the Iranians as well as said Iraqi's for training in Iran. The mission made a strategic impact, <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> 17 (a unit consisting of US Army Special Forces and elite Iraqi units conducting Counter Iranian Influence missions) stepped up its raids against Iranian targets. Operators from <b>Task</b> <b>Force</b> knight responded to 2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel, but the incident was eventually resolved.
