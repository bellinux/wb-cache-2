5|$|By {{the time}} of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised {{him that if he}} killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos tried to commit suicide but was saved by Athena, who <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> to Olympus. Awarded the Blades of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E
5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E

5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed warrior {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer had to {{wait two}} months to achieve another victory, {{claiming}} the destruction of two Vickers Wellingtons and one Armstrong Whitworth Whitley within the space of 62 minutes {{in the early hours}} of 1 August. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer flew their first combat mission with the Lichtenstein radar on the night 5/6 August 1942. Though they managed to make contact with an enemy aircraft they failed to shoot it down. On the night of the 24/25 August 1942, Schnaufer became an ace (his fifth aerial victory), when he filed a claim for another Wellington. This was the first time Rumpelhardt had <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> into contact using the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C UHF-band airborne radar. His next claim was made on the night of 28/29 August. This was probably a No. 78 Squadron Halifax II W7809, piloted by Sergeant John A. B. Marshall of the Royal Australian Air Force, on a secondary attack against Saarbrücken. The primary attack force was targeting Nuremberg that night. On the night of the 21/22 December 1942, Schnaufer shot down an Avro Lancaster; his first victory against this type. It was Schnaufer's seventh victory. Schnaufer may also have been responsible for the destruction of another Lancaster that night. Rumpelhardt and Schnaufer had attacked a Lancaster and observed it catching fire followed by the aircraft plunging earthwards. Hauptmann Wilhelm Herget from I./Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (I./NJG4—1st group of the 4th Night Fighter Wing) had also attacked a four-engined bomber in the same vicinity. The draw decided in favour of Herget who was given credit for the destruction of the Lancaster.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after his}} Real switch, Beckham also ended his {{relationship}} with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe who had <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> through his career up until this point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid.

Then, Rajah Humabon and his queen were baptized {{into the}} Catholic faith, taking the Christian names Carlos, {{in honor of}} King Charles of Spain, and Juana, in honor of King Charles' mother. To commemorate this event, Magellan gave Juana the Santo Niño, {{an image of the}} infant Jesus, as a symbol of their new alliance and held their first mass in the coast.|$|E
25|$|Gable's acting coach, Josephine Dillon — {{a theater}} manager in Portland – was 17 {{years older than}} him. She paid to have his teeth {{repaired}} and his hair styled. She <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which he slowly managed to lower, to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After {{a long period of}} training, Dillon considered him ready to attempt a film career.|$|E
25|$|To escape World War I in Europe, {{he moved}} to the Dutch East Indies (present day of Indonesia), which he saw as a neutral and a far {{distance}} place from the war. He went to Java on the invitation of Henri Maclaine Pont, a former fellow student, to assist Pont's architecture firm. Never trained as a town planner, Karsten envisaged the Indies-architectural elements with a town planning approach from scratch. His social vision <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> to reject colonial town planning but to shape colonial urban environment by including native elements. In the 1920s he committed himself to the Dutch East Indies saying Java was his 'home' and that his growing antipathy towards 'Western civilization' helped him to articulate his work. He married a Javanese woman.|$|E

25|$|During his childhood, Bernstein {{performed}} professionally as {{a dancer}} and an actor, {{in the latter case}} playing the part of Caliban in The Tempest on Broadway, and he also won several prizes for his painting. He attended Manhattan's progressive Walden School and gravitated toward music at the age of twelve, at which time he was given a scholarship in piano by Henriette Michelson, a Juilliard teacher who <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> throughout his entire career as a pianist. She took him to play some of his improvisations for composer Aaron Copland, who was encouraging and selected Israel Citkowitz as a teacher for the young boy. Bernstein's music has some stylistic similarities to Copland's music, most notably in his western scores, particularly sections of Big Jake, in the Gregory Peck film Amazing Grace and Chuck, and in his spirited score for the 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's novel God's Little Acre.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{stood up}} and started towards Angelo Dundee who <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> into the corner. At first Dundee talked and slapped Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed a new pair of gloves, thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E
500|$|Though the {{interceptor}} pilot {{reported to}} ground control, [...] "Target destroyed", the Soviet command, from general on down, indicated surprise and consternation at KAL007's continued flight, {{and ability to}} regain its altitude and maneuver.

25|$|Written in {{the first}} person, the poem tells of Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead, lasting {{from the night before}} Good Friday to the Wednesday after Easter in the spring of 1300.

Beatrice was a Florentine woman whom he had met in {{childhood}} and admired from afar in the mode of the then-fashionable courtly love tradition, which is highlighted in Dante's earlier work La Vita Nuova.|$|R

500|$|When Paoli was young, {{his parents}} would often {{take him to}} operas at Ponce's La Perla Theater located {{a block away from}} Paoli's residence. There, on one {{occasion}} he saw a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore by Italian tenor, Pietro Baccei, and at that moment knew {{what he wanted to do}} as an adult. His parents were very supportive of his ambition and <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of [...] "voice" [...] directed by Ramon Marin. His sister Amalia was a soprano who performed at La Perla in Emilio Arrieta's opera, Marina. In 1883, when Paoli was only 12 years old, both his parents died and he went to live in Spain with his sister Amalia.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Hatanaka {{hoped that}} simply occupying the palace and showing the {{beginnings}} of a rebellion would inspire the rest of the Army to rise up against the move to surrender. This notion <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> through much of the last days and hours and gave him the blind optimism to move ahead with the plan, despite having little support from his superiors. Having set all the pieces into position, Hatanaka and his co-conspirators decided that the Guard would take over the palace at 02:00. The hours until then were spent in continued attempts to convince their superiors in the Army to join the coup. At about the same time, General Anami committed seppuku, leaving a message that, [...] "I—with my death—humbly apologize to the Emperor for the great crime." [...] Whether the crime involved losing the war, or the coup, remains unclear.|$|E
500|$|His married life, {{settled and}} calm {{in its early}} years, became {{increasingly}} tense and difficult {{following the death of}} his daughter, Olga, in 1903. Years of effort in obscurity took their toll, and almost ended his ambitions as a composer: [...] "I was beaten down", he wrote later, [...] "My own students gave me advice – how to compose, how to speak through the orchestra". Success in 1916 – when Karel Kovařovic finally decided to perform Jenůfa in Prague – brought its own problems. Janáček grudgingly resigned himself to the changes forced upon his work. Its success brought him into Prague's music scene and the attentions of soprano Gabriela Horvátová, who <b>guided</b> <b>him</b> through Prague society. Janáček was enchanted by her. On his return to Brno, he appears not to have concealed his new passion from Zdenka, who responded by attempting suicide. Janáček was furious with Zdenka and tried to instigate a divorce, but lost interest in Horvátová. Zdenka, anxious to avoid the public scandal of formal divorce, persuaded him to settle for an [...] "informal" [...] divorce. From then on, until Janáček's death, they lived separate lives in the same household.|$|E
