5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were in short supply.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> certain substrates.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b> They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts.

5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} of tomato. The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan {{to suggest that it}} is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms of tomato systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E

5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E
5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine <b>for</b> <b>processing.</b> The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E
