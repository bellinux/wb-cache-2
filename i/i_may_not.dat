500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg's first {{professional}} {{job in the}} animation business was as a director on Rocko's Modern Life (19931996), Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production. He [...] "ended up finding work in the industry and got a job" [...] at the television network after he met the show's creator, Joe Murray, at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival, where Wormholes and Murray's My Dog Zero were both in competition. Murray, who was looking for people to direct Rocko's Modern Life at the time, saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series. He [...] " [...] friends that [...] a hard time about [...] ... but doors opened when [...] stepped into the animation world," [...] so he accepted it. He [...] "was planning on being a starving artist": [...] " [...] several thousand dollars {{to make a film}} and [...] <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> make it backI had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film.. and he took a huge chance," [...] Hillenburg related.|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be able to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live {{in such a way that}} I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{her role}} in saving Osiris, Nut {{was seen as a}} friend and {{protector}} of the dead, who appealed to her as a child appeals to its mother: [...] "O my Mother Nut, stretch Yourself over me, that I may be placed among the imperishable stars which are in You, and that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> die."

Hershock, in {{discussing}} these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: [...] "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor." ...|$|E

[...] He also admitted that it was completely different from his previous work and said that [...] " [...] deals with a very complex drama. And <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> nail it on this film, it may just be my first step." [...] Reitman wanted to make the film right after his 2009 film Up in the Air, but due to Winslet's scheduling conflicts, he chose to direct Young Adult first.|$|E
2500|$|This type of causal {{foreseeability}} is to {{be distinguished}} from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which {{is a question of}} remoteness of damage, not causation.

[...] However, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence: The Wagon Mound (No 1) [...] AC 388 (Privy Council).
