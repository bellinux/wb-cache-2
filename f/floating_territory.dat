40|$|Many small {{countries}} {{are in need}} of additional territory. They build landfills and expensive artificial islands. The ocean covers 71 per cent of the Earth surface. Those countries (or persons of wealth) starting the early colonization of the ocean may obtain advantages through additional territory or creating their own independent state. An old idea is building a big ship. The best solution to this problem, however, is the provision of floating cities, islands, and states. The author idea is to use for floating cities, islands, and states a cheap floating platform created from a natural ice field taken from the Arctic or Antarctic oceans. These cheap platforms protected by air-film (bottom and sides) and a conventional insulating cover (top) and having a cooling system can exist for an unlimited time. They can be increased in number or size at any time, float in warm oceans, travel to different continents and countries, serve as artificial airports, harbors and other marine improvements, as well as floating cities and industrial bases for virtually any use. Author researches and computes parameters of these ice floating platforms, other methods of building such <b>floating</b> <b>territory,</b> compares them and shows that the offered method is the most cheap and efficient means of ocean colonization.

50|$|Most {{species of}} Etheostoma exhibit unique nuptial {{coloration}} and E. barrenense is no exception. It Reproductive isolation and sexual selection between species {{is thought to}} maintain these diverse color patterns, as these fish are often found in sympatric populations. Breeding is an interesting phenomenon; males establish <b>floating</b> <b>territories</b> in deep pools and females approach these microhabitats where both fish will press against inclined stones to lay their eggs. Many eggs are laid at one time, but they are usually produced individually on separate, vertical rocks in slightly flowing currents. This dispersing of the eggs increases the chance of survival {{for at least a}} few of the offspring. The eggs are spherical, translucent, and adhesive, providing them a greater opportunity to survive as they are attached to a vertical wall and often difficult to detect.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a 3 year field study on the behavioural ecology of the mara on the Vald√©s Peninsula in Argentina. The main goal was to investigate why the mara's social system incorporates both monogamy and communal denning, a combination unknown in other mammals. The research techniques used were behavioural observations and radio-tracking. Radio-tracking of 9 maras revealed that pairs were continually moving into new areas, suggesting that their ranging behaviour is adapted to an irregular pattern of resource distribution. Two maras had prevailing ranges of 35 ha and moved yearly over about 200 ha. Ranges floated around a geographic centre. One constraint on the animals' movements may be the need to stay near a den site for pupping. Maras were diurnal, and spent on average 46 % of the day grazing. Ranges may overlap up to 33 %, but range use between neighbouring pairs were negatively correlated suggesting that animals were avoiding each other [...] pairs may be occupying <b>floating</b> <b>territories.</b> Evidence that maras are monogamous in the wild is presented. The factors leading to monogamy are argued to be: (i) females are irregularly dispersed because of the distribution of food; and (ii) the brevity of the female's oestrus (1 - 2 hrs). A male attempting to mate polygynously would have difficulties in finding and securing a female; thus males may do best by staying with one female to ensure a successful mating. Males may enhance their reproductive success by watching for predators so that their females can spend more time feeding to meet the energetic demands of lactation and gestation. During the pupping season, August to January, groups of 1 to 22 pairs gather at single dens. Several dens may be located near each other to form denning communities. Most pairs produce only one litter a year and there is a peak of births in September and October. Pairs visit the den once a day for a period of 5 - 6 weeks to nurse their young. Den sites are not limited; and the reason maras den communally appears to be the increased protection from predators accruing to pups and adults in larger groups. Two possible routes are suggested {{in the evolution of the}} mara's social system: (i) from a monogamous starting point it has become advantageous to creche pups; or (ii) ancestral maras were more colonial and probably polygynous, but have been forced to space out because of changes in the distribution of food, which has led to monogamy. Finally, maras were compared with other caviomorph rodents, lagomorphs, and monogamous ruminants and were shown to be most similar to the latter in their adaptations to the environment a remarkable example of convergent evolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{response}} to a recent article by Hanna Kokko and William J. Sutherland (American Naturalist 152 : 354 - 366), who consider evolutionarily stable territory acceptance rules for animals that face the decision between settling on a poor territory now (which is then retained for life) or waiting for better habitat to become available later (taking a chance of dying before reproducing). In contrast to these authors, we argue that the evolutionarily stable threshold quality above which territories are acceptable does depend on whether individuals compete for a single territory (queuing) or For multiple <b>territories</b> (<b>floating)</b> and also on whether access to territories is determined by a hierarchy among waiting individuals. More specifically, we show the following: First, if the choice is between floating and settling, the evolutionarily stable acceptance threshold is such that threshold territories yield an expected lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 1 - mu(F), the survival probability of a floater. Second, if the choice is between queuing and settling, the evolutionarily stable threshold may correspond to any LRS between 1 - mu(F) and unity. Third, the number of nonbreeding individuals in the population is maximized at a threshold of unity. In other words, the evolutionarily stable threshold does not maximize the nonbreeding Fraction of the population. We argue that models of territory choice should carefully specify the mechanism of choice because some choice processes (e. g., indiscriminate habitat use above the threshold) do not admit an evolutionarily stable acceptance rule...|$|R
