40|$|Credit Reallocation We {{inquire into}} the {{existence}} of a process of <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> reallocation. Employing the methodology developed by Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) for the measurement of job reallocation, we find that at any phase of the business cycle a significant amount of credit flows across U. S. firms. Credit reallocation well exceeds net credit changes and is highly volatile. We also find that, {{as a result of a}} procyclical credit creation and a more mildly countercyclical credit destruction, credit reallocation is moderately procyclical. Finally, most of the magnitude and dynamics of credit reallocation reflect credit flows across firms relatively homogeneous for size, industry or location. The results suggest that recent models of macroeconomic restructuring which allow for lock-in effects in credit relationships can usefully complement established models of the flight to quality and the financial accelerator...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of trade credit in the {{financing}} of French small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using specific data collected in a recent survey on small firms. We provide direct evidence that <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> offered by SMEs is sensitive to the strategic importance of firm size and position. Using existing theories, we also test a supply function and a model of demand for trade credit. On the one hand, results validate supply-side theories relative to a reduction of asymmetric information between the buyer and the seller. On the other hand, econometric exercises show that both a transaction motive, linked to efficient cash management, and a financing motive are significant determinant of trade credit demand. According the financing motive, trade credit is specifically used for the purpose of short-term financing by firms exposed to information asymmetries and bank credit rationing.

40|$|Delayed payment (trade credit) and {{prepayment}} {{are widely}} observed forms of interfirm credit. We propose a simple theory {{to account for}} the prevalence of such credit. A downstream firm trades off inventory holding costs against lost sales. Lost final sales impose a negative externality on the upstream firm. The solution requires a subsidy limited by the value of inputs. Allowing the downstream firm to pay with a delay, an arrangement known as “trade credit,” is precisely such a solution. Further, solving a reverse externality accounts for the use of prepayment for inputs, {{even in the absence of}} any risk of default by the downstreamfirm. We clarify howinput prices vary with such policies as well as when such instruments are more efficient than pure input price adjustments. Thus we account for <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> as an optimal instrument delivering a targeted inventory subsidy designed to prevent lost sales. The theory offers an explanation for the widespread use of net terms, and the fact that prepayment always carries a zero interest rate.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that new banks and rapidly growing banks are risk prone. We study {{this problem by}} designing a relationship-lending model in which a bank operates as a financial intermediary and centralised monitor. In the absence of deposit insurance, the bank’s limited liability option creates an incentive problem between the bank and its depositors, the likely outcome {{of which is a}} reduction in the amounts of resources allocated to monitoring its borrowers. Hence, the bank must signal its safety to depositors by maintaining the equity ratio held. The optimal equity ratio is dynamic, ie new banks need relatively more equity than established banks, which enjoy profitable old lending relationships – charter value – that reduce the incentive problem. However, if an established bank grows rapidly, its share of old relationships also decreases and the bank will have to raise its equity ratio. With deposit insurance, regulators should set higher equity requirements for new banks and rapidly growing banks than for those in a more established position. The results of the model can be extended to more general <b>inter-firm</b> control of <b>credit</b> institutions. financial intermediation; relationship banking; financial fragility; bank regulation; deposit insurance; moral hazard; product quality...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{document}} financial aspects of transactions, and trade credit supply behavior with FDI among {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises(SMEs) based on two original surveys, conducted in four cities in China in 2003. The survey was designed to capture the nature of <b>inter-firm</b> transactions, trade <b>credit</b> and other financial conditions. Literature on FDI mainly refers to technology transfer, employment or investment. This paper focuses on the role and significance of FDI in the supply of trade credit due to its trade credit enforcement technology. Yanagawa, Ito and Watanabe [2006] developed a model which indicates that when a seller has higher enforcement technology or a buyer has richer liquidity, both trade credit and transaction volume will be increased. In this paper, we confirmed that FDI and G contributed to the provision of trade credit and had a positive external effect on trade credit enforcement towards China’s economy. (1) Sales towards FDI customers {{have the power to}} increase the trade credit ratio,even when controlling other factors such as choice of payment instrument, competitiveness, and expost default management. This implies that FDI does provide trade credit, not only because it has superior liquidity, but because it is also superior in terms of enforcement of trade credit repayment. (2) Cash constraints of the buyer influence the decisions concerning trade credit provided by the seller, as a model in Yanagawa, et al. [2006] predicted, and this implies that strategic default is a serious concern among SMEs in China. (3) Spillover effect exists in payment enforcement technology in transactions with FDI customers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} the literature on the determinants of <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> and on its implications for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Theoretical explanations for trade credit can be divided in two categories: a) theories based on real functions performed by trade credit; b) theories based on transaction and financial motivations. The former category includes theories that interpret the supply of trade credit as a tool to achieve a variety of marketing objectives (to build customer relationships, as a guarantee for product quality, as a mechanism for price discrimination, as a response to demand variability). The latter category includes theories that consider trade credit as a tool to reduce transaction costs (as a substitute for money) or as a financial alternative to bank credit or to other forms of financing. The paper also examines the macroeconomic implications of these theories, with special reference to the relations between trade credit and monetary policy. Conclusions set forward some hypotheses for research, by looking at preliminary evidence on European countries, which are characterised by strong differences in the length of payment terms that led to the adoption of an EC Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. credito commerciale, dilazioni di pagamento, politica monetaria...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters that analyze issues relating to automobile fuel economy. Chapter 1 discusses automobile fuel economy regulations in the United States. The new U. S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards not only tighten the target fuel economy to be achieved by automakers, but also make significant changes to the design/structure of CAFE standards by introducing three policy instruments (footprint-based targets, intra-firm transferring of fuel efficiency credits between passenger cars and light trucks, and inter-firm trading of fuel efficiency credits). While {{there are a number}} of previous studies on the impact of tightening CAFE standards, economists have paid little attention to the design of CAFE standards. I use policy simulation to evaluate these policy instruments relating to the design of CAFE standards. First, I model and estimate the demand- and supply-sides of the U. S. vehicle market using various data sets. Then, based on the estimation results, I simulate the vehicle market and the demand for driving under four counterfactual CAFE policies with different designs, and examine the impacts of the three policy instruments. Simulation results suggest: (1) footprint-based targets have little impact on market shares, producer profits, consumer surplus, and gasoline use; (2) <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> trading lowers overall compliance costs by about $ 110 - 140 million, and thus increases social welfare; and (3) allowing intra-firm credit transferring (but not <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> trading) reduces aggregate gasoline consumption by 0. 1 - 0. 25 %. Chapter 2 proposes a new approach to analyzing how automobile fuel economy is valued in the market, using a hedonic regression framework. A distinctive feature of my approach is the use of each vehicle's miles traveled: a consumer's marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for fuel economy is inferred with her vehicle's miles traveled. With the inferred MWTP, we apply the steps of the standard hedonic method backward and estimate each vehicle's marginal and total price of fuel economy, and consumers' discount rate for future fuel cost savings. We find that the standard hedonic method may not provide a stable and reasonable estimate of the value of fuel economy, likely due to the omitted variable bias from vehicle attributes such as safety features, interior equipment and reliability. This method makes it possible to separate the portion of vehicle price that is attributable to fuel economy, and significantly alleviates the omitted variable bias. Applying the procedure to model year 2001 vehicles in the U. S. market, we estimate that consumers discount future fuel cost savings at the annual rate of 26 - 43 %, that for the middle case of the discount rate of 34 %, the price of a 0. 1 gallon per 100 miles improvement in fuel efficiency is on average $ 75 (in 2000 U. S. dollars), and that for the same case, the average total price of fuel economy is $ 1, 950. We also find that larger, less fuel efficient vehicles tend to have higher marginal and total prices of fuel economy. Chapter 3 examines whether Japanese fuel economy regulations established in the 1990 s induced technological progress in Japanese automakers' technology for providing fuel economy. By observing how fuel economy of automobiles has improved after controlling for changes in vehicle characteristics such as weight and power, I find that fuel economy improvement accelerated after regulations were introduced, implying induced innovation in fuel efficiency technology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{financial aspects}} of transactions and trade credit supply behavior with {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) among small- and medium-sized enterprises, based on two original surveys. The surveys, conducted in four cities in China in 2003, were designed to uncover the nature of <b>inter-firm</b> transactions, trade <b>credit</b> and other financial conditions. Literature on FDI mainly refers to technology transfer, employment, or investment. This paper focuses on the role/significance of FDI in the supply of trade credit due to its enforcement technology of trade credit. Yanagawa, Ito, and Watanabe (2006) developed an incomplete contract model wherein when the seller has a higher enforcement technology or the buyer has richer liquidity, both trade credit and transaction volume will increase. In this paper we first compute the "enforcement probability" of each seller then test the propositions of the model. We confirm that (1) FDI and G firms provide larger trade credit. (2) This is due to their higher enforcement probability in trade credit. Furthermore, (3) higher enforcement probability has a positive external effect in enhancing the trade credit and transaction volume of indirect transaction partners. However, we also find that (4) {{in order to raise}} the probability of "no default," enhancing the ratio of cash on delivery is a necessary measure. (5) A more competitive supplier will prefer cash on delivery payment and consequently will provide less trade credit to the economy. (6) With a shorter transaction period, the supplier will provide larger trade credit. This implies that firms with a stronger bargaining power prefer providing no trade credit though they can expect higher enforcement probability, thus reduces the volume of economic activity. These negative forces against enhancing trade credit and economic activity exist at a substantial level in China. Because of this force, a strategic default problem persists in China even 30 years after the transition began. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} two questionnaires presented to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) by RIETI in February 2008 and February 2009. Given the limited data on SMEs, {{the purpose of the}} questionnaires is to understand the current status of financing for SMEs facing this serious economic recession, triggered by the financial crisis. The Survey on the Status of Transactions between Businesses and Financial Institutions conducted in February 2008, was sent to 17, 018 companies nationwide, with SMEs being the main target, and of those recipients 6, 124 companies or 36. 0 % responded. This survey, which was designed to explain the structural characteristics of SME financing, illustrated terms and conditions such as accounts payable and bills payable for <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit,</b> differences in the roles of major lending financial institutions including main banks, and the impact of changes in the credit guarantee system in recent years. Regarding the Survey on the Status of Transactions between Businesses and Financial Institutions following the Financial Crisis conducted in February 2009, RIETI targeted 5, 979 of the companies who responded to the 2008 survey and of those companies 4, 103 or 68. 6 % responded. The survey was conducted to understand how the relationships between companies and financial institutions and customers and suppliers changed, and what measures SMEs took to address these changes, {{in light of the fact}} that the cash management of SMEs has been extremely difficult since last autumn, when the global credit crunch set in. Although the surveys were not identical, some of the same questions were asked in both surveys. The answers to these questions were then compared to see how conditions had changed and to understand which areas of SME financing had become more difficult. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on firm-level frictions and their aggregate implications. The first two chapters show that inter-firm lending {{plays an important role}} in business cycle fluctuations. In Chapter I, I theoretically investigate the role of supplier credit relationships in propagating and amplifying small shocks using a stylized model of inter-firm trade and lending. I build a network model of the economy in which trade in intermediate goods is financed by supplier credit. In the model, a financial shock to one firm affects its ability to make payments to its suppliers. The credit linkages between firms then transmit financial shocks across firms, amplifying their effects on aggregate output. In Chapter II, I embed this mechanism into a more general macroeconomic framework to study empirically the role that <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> plays in the business cycle. To calibrate the model, I construct a proxy of inter-industry credit flows from firm- and industry-level data. I find that the credit network of the US accounts for 22 percent of the fall in GDP occurring from an aggregate financial shock. Finally, I use a structural factor approach to estimate the shocks which affected US industrial production (IP) industries from 1997 - 2013. I find that most aggregate volatility in IP was driven by aggregate liquidity shocks and idiosyncratic productivity shocks, and that the credit network of IP industries generated 17 percent of observed aggregate volatility. During the recent recession, three-quarters of the drop in aggregate IP was due to an aggregate financial shock. Chapter III presents a theoretical investigation of the long-run relationship between international trade and unemployment. I develop and analyze a static general equilibrium model with labor market frictions and heterogeneous firms in which firms can engage in cross-border hiring by employing labor domestically or from abroad. This chapter outlines the conditions on the model parameters under which unemployment rises or falls after trade liberalization, and demonstrates that models in the literature which ignore cross-border hiring likely underestimate the upward force of trade liberalization on unemployment...|$|E
40|$|Does {{regional}} science matter nowadays? Several {{researchers have}} tried - {{and are still}} trying - {{to answer this question}} at the {{light of the fact that}} fast connections and communication technologies allow economic actors to easily interact and do business with global partners. Anyhow, the local and global dimensions seem to play a complementary role in influencing firms' economic performance and behaviour rather than being substitute factors. In fact, there are many cases of excellence among Italian industrial districts, high-tech clusters, and innovative milieus which suggest the relevance of the local dimension for firms to grow and compete. The analysis of the local economic dimension dates back to the pioneering contribution of MARSHALL on the industrial district concept (Principles of Economics, 1890, Macmillan, London), which highlights the peculiar advantages for a firm from being located in an industrially specialised local system. According to MARSHALL's (1890) analysis, firms operating in a spatially bounded - and specialised - area can benefit from both tangible and intangible effects. Tangible effects are mainly related to the local availability of inputs' suppliers and specialised workers, the reduction of transportation costs, and the emerging of external-scale economies. On the contrary, intangible effects are related to the reduction of transaction costs (favoured by face-to-face and repeated interactions which increase trust, reputation, and reciprocity among the local actors), and the spread of knowledge and (tacit) information flows concerning production processes, technologies, and innovation practices. Moving from these intuitions, economists started to analyse the role played by local forces in influencing the economic performance of regional systems and individual actors (i. e. firms). Attention has also been paid to local-based phenomena other than specialised agglomerated areas. Among these, the role of urban areas and the advantages related to the location in large and industrially diversified cities have been deeply analysed by geographers and regional economists. In particular, agglomeration forces concerning - and arising from - the spatial concentration of the economic activity received great attention in both the theoretical and the empirical literature. The contribution of GLAESER, KALLAL, SCHEINKMAN and SHLEIFER ("Growth in Cities", Journal of Political Economy, 1992, Vol. 100, No. 6, pp. 1126 - 1152) represented the first attempt to empirically analyse the causal relationship between agglomeration externalities and local economic performance, and it began a wide cross-county literature on the topic. This Thesis moves in this direction and tries to contribute to the debate concerning the relationship between spatial agglomeration forces and firms' economic performance. Specifically, it comes as a collection of three empirical papers dealing with this topic from very different perspectives. The first chapter of the Thesis is entitled "Productivity, Credit Constraints and the Role of Short-Run Localization Economies: Micro-Evidence from Italy". This chapter is single-authored and is forthcoming in Regional Studies (doi: 10. 1080 / 00343404. 2015. 1064883). This paper investigates whether Italian manufacturing firms' productivity is affected by credit constraints, and whether short-run localisation economies foster productivity both directly and indirectly, moderating the negative effects of credit rationing via <b>inter-firm</b> <b>credit</b> relationships. The empirical exercise is based on a sample of 12, 524 firms observed over the period 1999 - 2007 and drawn from the AIDA databank (Bureau Van Dijk), and it is carried out in three steps. First, Total Factor Productivity is estimated at the firm level through the approach proposed by WOOLDRIDGE ("On Estimating Firm-Level Production Functions Using Proxy Variables to Control for Unobservables", Economics Letters, 2009, Vol. 104, No. 3, pp. 112 - 114). Second, dynamic investment equations are estimated to investigate whether firms are credit constrained, and to test the potential moderation effect of short-run localisation economies on the investment-to-cash flow sensitivity. Third, an instrumental-variable approach is employed to test whether firms' productivity is negatively affected by credit constraints (i. e. the marginal effect of cash flow on investments), and whether short-run localisation economies positively affect productivity both directly and indirectly, downsizing the negative effects of credit rationing. The results suggest that firms are affected by credit rationing, and that localisation economies positively moderate the investment-to-cash flow sensitivity favouring inter-firm trade credit. It emerges a negative effect of credit rationing on firms' productivity, while localisation economies have both a direct and an indirect positive effect on productivity. In fact, short-run localisation economies seem to reduce the negative credit constraints-productivity relationship by about 4. 5...|$|E
