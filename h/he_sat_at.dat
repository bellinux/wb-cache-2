25|$|Morse largely sat out {{the rest}} of the 1960 campaign. He even opted out of going to the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Instead <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> home and watched it on {{television}} from Eugene.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Disco {{continued}} with the WWA, appearing at the Revolution pay-per-view in February. During this show he issued an open challenge {{for anyone to}} face him, as he had no opponent to face. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> ringside commentating in his usual style until he was beaten down by the returning Scott Steiner. The next PPV, Eruption, saw Disco commentating on the full event and not competing. He tried to intervene on a celebration dance off by Brian Christopher and Ernest Miller.|$|E

25|$|While the {{identity}} of 'Gil Sambong' remained a mystery, a group of Westerners claimed that Choe Yeonggyeong, an influential scholar of Jeonju and a major Easterner, was 'Gil Sambong', because <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the highest seat in an archery practice held by the Daedonggye. Choe was brought before Seonjo, where he claimed {{that he had never}} had any form of connection with Jeong Yeorip. Both Seonjo and Jeong Cheol thought Choe was not 'Gil Sambong'. However, Westerner pressure forced Seonjo to continue the torture of Choe. Choe died of torture in 1590.|$|E
25|$|A noted {{figure on}} Bucharest's bohemian scene, the painter frequented the artistic-literary club at Casa Capșa restaurant. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the same table}} {{with some of the}} modernist and neo-traditionalist writers (Camil Baltazar, Liviu Rebreanu, Vasile Voiculescu, Ilarie Voronca), and, story goes, was once caught up in a cake fight with the satirist and prankster Păstorel Teodoreanu. Sion {{satisfied}} public expectations with portraits of the Bucharest upper middle class and proposed a design for the Vasile Alecsandri Mausoleum. He lost the latter commission to Paul Molda—reportedly, Sion preserved a bitter grudge against the Romanian Academy, who had ruled against him in this matter.|$|E
25|$|Pioneer newspaperman John Houston {{arrived in}} South Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was {{published}} on November 6th, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. John's articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his printing press and worked on the newspaper.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{entering}} the Senate in 1987, McCain kept a low profile. [...] He {{became a member}} of the Senate Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he was also given positions on the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee. [...] For his first two years in the Senate, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the Candy desk.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Best was dismissed, Epstein {{attempted}} to console him by offering to build another group around him, but Best refused. Feeling let down and depressed, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> home for two weeks—not wanting to face anybody or answer the inevitable {{questions about why}} he had been sacked. Epstein secretly arranged with his booking agent partner, Joe Flannery, for Best to join Lee Curtis & the All Stars, which then broke off from Curtis to become Pete Best & the All Stars. They signed to Decca Records, releasing the single [...] "I'm Gonna Knock On Your Door", which was not successful.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Ray said, [...] "I'd written 'You Really Got Me' as {{tribute to}} all those great blues people I love: Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy." [...] Dave cited Gerry Mulligan as an inspiration, saying, [...] "Ray was a great fan of Gerry Mulligan, who was in , and as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the piano at home, he sort of messed around in a vein similar to Mulligan {{and came up with}} this figure based on a 12-bar blues". Dave has also said that song had been {{inspired}} by Jimmy Giuffre's song [...] "The Train and the River". According to the band's manager, Larry Page, the song's characteristic riff came about while working out the chords of the Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie". Lyrically, the song was said to be influenced by an encounter with one of the band's [...] "first serious female fans." ...|$|E

500|$|In early April 1945, Anna {{arranged}} for Rutherfurd {{to come over}} from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his [...] "Little White House" [...] in Warm Springs, Georgia, the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s. Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a card table by the living room stone fireplace, fine-tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12, 1945. In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other, Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple, saying [...] "I have a terrific headache", then slumped over losing consciousness. Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage. Since a thorough medical exam a year before, he had received increasingly more intensive care and concern from a young recently recruited private physician.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} August 1993 {{and ended in}} December of that year. Although most {{of the film is}} set in Alabama, filming took place mainly in and around Beaufort, South Carolina, as well as parts of coastal Virginia and North Carolina, {{including}} a running shot on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Downtown portions of the fictional town of Greenbow were filmed in Varnville, South Carolina. The scene of Forrest running through Vietnam while under fire was filmed on Fripp Island, South Carolina. Additional filming took place on the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, and along the Blue Ridge Parkway near Boone, North Carolina. The most notable place was Grandfather Mountain where a part of the road is named [...] "Forrest Gump Curve". The Gump family home set was built along the Combahee River near Yemassee, South Carolina, and the nearby land was used to film Curran's home {{as well as some of}} the Vietnam scenes. Over 20palmetto trees were planted to improve the Vietnam scenes. Forrest Gump narrated his life's story at the southern edge of Chippewa Square in Savannah, Georgia, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a bus stop bench. There were other scenes filmed in and around the Savannah area as well, including a running shot on the Richard V. Woods Memorial Bridge in Beaufort while he was being interviewed by the press, and on West Bay Street in Savannah. Most of the college campus scenes were filmed in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California. The lighthouse that Forrest runs across to reach the Atlantic Ocean the first time is the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Port Clyde, Maine. Additional scenes were filmed in Arizona, Utah's Monument Valley, and Montana's Glacier National Park.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, , Dylan {{describes}} first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: [...] "He {{looked like}} Sydney Greenstreet {{from the film}} The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his corner table. Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Genres {{attributed}} to [...] "God Only Knows" [...] include baroque rock, baroque pop, art pop, psychedelic rock, avant-pop, and experimental pop. Brian Wilson {{has said that}} he wrote the song as an attempt to match the standard of the Beatles' Rubber Soul album, which was released in December 1965. In his recollection, he was under the influence of marijuana and was [...] "so blown away" [...] with the album that <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his piano and began writing the song.|$|E
2500|$|The men sprayed {{the lobby}} with gunfire upon entering. The first victim was {{maintenance}} worker Frédéric Boisseau, {{who was killed}} as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the reception desk. The gunmen forced Rey at gunpoint to lead them to a second-floor office, where 15 staff members were having an editorial meeting, Charlie Hebdos first news conference of the year. Reporter Laurent Léger said they were interrupted by {{what they thought was}} the sound of a firecracker—the gunfire from the lobby—and recalled, [...] "We still thought it was a joke. The atmosphere was still joyous." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Capt. Boit of the American sloop Union, Kendrick [...] "informed Capt. Brown {{that on the}} morrow {{he should}} cause {{the flag of the}} United States to be hoisted and fire a federal salute, which he begged might be {{answered}} by the two Englishmen, and it was accordingly agreed to, and Capt. Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose, and about ten the next morning the ship Jackal began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered to be primed. So the apron of the fourth firearm was taken off which was fired and being shotted with round and grape shot, it pierced the side of the Lady Washington and killed Capt Kendrick as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his table, and killed and wounded many upon the deck." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the performances, Nicholson wore a judge's wig and {{robe and}} was {{referred}} to as [...] "my lord" [...] by the cast. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a raised desk next to boxes for the prosecutor, witness, and jury. In many instances, men would play the roles of women. The audience sat directly in front of Nicholson's desk. Many of the trials satirised and exaggerated the details of well-known divorce cases, and the actors who portrayed the lawyers often mimicked famous lawyers. The testimonies that were delivered during the performances were generally filled with of innuendos and double entendres. The audiences often included well known citizens and occasionally members of Parliament. The Garrick’s Head and Town Hotel charged visitors a one shilling fee for admittance. Once inside, each guest was given a glass of grog and a cigar.|$|E
2500|$|For years Victor Resendiz, {{better known}} as Latin Lover, had worked for AAA, making a name for himself. He had also been quite {{successful}} in other television appearances and broke away from AAA to handle his own match bookings. Following his departure AAA sought an injunction against him using the name [...] "Latin Lover", claiming they owned the copyright to the name. In November 2010 <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> ringside for a Friday night CMLL Super Viernes show, causing quite a stir with his appearance as he fought against Los Invasores, especially co-captain Héctor Garza {{who had been a}} rival of Latin Lover in AAA. Los Invasores attacked Rezendiz before he was saved by Shocker. Days later he was announced as using the ring name Latino in CMLL. It was later announced that Latino would team up with Guapos Internacional (Shocker and Jon Strongman) and CMLL's top tecnico Místico for Sin Piedad. The team would face Invasores co-captain Héctor Garza, teaming with CMLL rudos Atlantis and La Peste Negra (El Felino and Negro Casas).|$|E
2500|$|John Houston {{arrived in}} Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and bought {{property}} in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. [...] The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got a chance to read his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.|$|E
