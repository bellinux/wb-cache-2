5|$|During his retirement, Smith {{had a large}} {{influence}} on the North Carolina basketball program. In 2003 Smith talked to Roy Williams regarding his decision {{about whether or not}} to replace a struggling Matt Doherty as head coach. Williams had previously declined the head coaching position three years <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> Guthridge retired.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{panel of}} the book, as Tintin, Haddock and Calculus's flight back home departs from the newly named Alcazaropolis, it flies over a slum that was seen <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> they flew into the country. In a stroke of political commentary, the upheaval of the government has caused virtually no change to the slum or the lives of its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|That night, {{the agents}} {{investigate}} the forest; Scully discovers strange ash on the ground, leading her to suspect cult activity. However, a local detective arrives and orders them to leave. Driving {{back to their}} motel, Mulder and Scully encounter {{a flash of light}} at the spot their car had malfunctioned <b>earlier.</b> <b>When</b> the car loses power, Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash, a phenomenon reported by alien abductees.|$|E

5|$|They soon {{reverted to}} state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission {{used them to}} realize plans it had made a decade <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> it first {{designated}} the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley. With the Midland's tracks unused, it now had a graded route that could easily be adapted for highway purposes.|$|E
5|$|Buhmaid {{was among}} a group of protesters who on 18 February marched toward the Pearl Roundabout {{following}} the funeral procession of protester Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed four days <b>earlier.</b> <b>When</b> the protesters neared Pearl Roundabout, the army opened fire. Buhmaid collapsed to the ground, and blood poured from his head after it was hit by a bullet. The army opened fire twice more. Protesters regrouped after each round of shooting. Riot police finally intervened and dispersed protesters. Over one hundred protesters were injured, some seriously. Buhmaid was taken to Salmaniya hospital where attempts to revive him failed over the course of three days. He died on the afternoon of 21 February.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish house {{across the street from the}} college.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, Wilson {{appeared}} in a pictorial and {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine. A few months <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> her pictorial was announced, a short storyline feud with Nidia developed, with the latter being jealous of the fact that Wilson was chosen for the cover and spread in the magazine. In weekly vignettes aired on SmackDown!, both Nidia and her on-screen boyfriend Jamie Noble made trips to The Playboy Mansion to complain to Hugh Hefner over his choice.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|Since the Spanish Armament of 1790, the Royal Navy {{had been}} at sea {{in a state of}} {{readiness}} for over three years. The Navy's dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> an ill-prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign—which ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Hamad died {{suddenly}} at 11:40 EAT (08:40 UTC) on 25 August 1896. His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected {{by some of}} his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate {{after the death of}} Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking {{over control of the}} government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs) recovers {{from his}} {{operation}} to remove fragments of a bullet, {{which he had}} received <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> encountering a deer. He asks his father Rick (Andrew Lincoln) if his friend Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz) is alright. Since Sophia is still missing, Rick reluctantly lies to Carl and tells him that she is fine. Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn), Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) move the vehicles and set up camp at the Greene home and are introduced to the Greene family. There, they lead a funeral procession for their ranch hand, Otis (Pruitt Taylor Vince). Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) is asked to share Otis' final moments; Shane sticks to his lie that Otis had sacrificed his life to save Carl, while in reality Shane (unwillingly) sacrificed Otis.|$|E
5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years <b>earlier</b> <b>when</b> adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|From 1813, Hope {{served as}} {{commander-in-chief}} at Leith until 1818 and in 1819 he was again promoted, {{this time to}} vice-admiral. In March 1820 he was recalled to the Admiralty as First Naval Lord in the Liverpool ministry. He remained there for seven years without participating {{in any of the}} important decisions and innovations of the period. He remarried in 1821 to Maria, Countess of Athlone and in 1825 was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). In 1827, in the chaotic aftermath of the collapse of Lord Liverpool's government, Hope was retired in favour of Sir George Cockburn and given the favourable role of treasurer and later commissioner of the Royal Naval Hospital in Greenwich. Despite his conflicts with Prince William 45 years <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> King William IV ascended the throne in 1830, he made Hope a privy councillor, before Hope entered retirement later in the year. Hope died in May 1831, a few months after giving up his seat in Parliament. Although he died in Bath, his remains were returned to the family crypt at Johnstone Church, Johnstone, Dumfriesshire.|$|E
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years <b>earlier,</b> <b>when</b> the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
