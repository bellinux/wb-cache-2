30|$|Insulating {{diatomite}} bricks {{are often}} prepared by firing the ore at 1000  °C {{through one of}} three methods: semi dry, plastic, and foam slip methods. To increase the porosity feature of the diatomite bricks, sawdust or cokes are sometimes used as pore former agent. Bricks made of diatomite are characterized by low thermal conductivity, high strength, and chemical resistance. Therefore, <b>diatomite</b> <b>brick</b> is used in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, power engineering, and glass application, in addition of cement and petrochemicals industries (Kashcheev et al. 2009 a; Tsibin 1966; Kazan Musuem 1976; Ivanov & Belyakov 2008; Kashcheev et al. 2009 a; Hanna et al. 2012; Ibrahim 2012; Da et al. 2014; Lui et al. 2017; Sari et al. 2018).|$|E
30|$|When {{diatomite}} {{is heated}} to above 1000  °C, its amorphous silica structure is damaged and converted to cristobalite (Kashcheev et al. 2009 b; Ibrahim and Selim 2012). The phase transformation of cristobalite {{may be the}} reason of the strength reduction of the <b>diatomite</b> <b>bricks.</b> In addition, the possible reactions between the accompanied accessory minerals in the crude diatomite ore with the active diatomitic silica, on firing to above 1000  °C, may form different amounts of liquid phases, which cause deformation in the <b>diatomite</b> <b>bricks.</b> In order {{to overcome these problems}} and to increase the applicability temperature of diatomite as well, calcium oxide was added, in the form of chalk, with different mass ratios from 0 to 30 %. This reaction between chalk and the diatomitic silica will result in the formation of wollastonite (CaO.SiO 2) mineral and accordingly, the chance of cristobalite formation will be decreased, resulting in increasing the applicable firing temperature (Kashcheev et al. 2009 a; Meradi et al. 2015; Merado et al. 2016; Galzerano et al. 2018).|$|R
