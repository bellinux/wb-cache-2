As the image plane is moved from IP1 to IP2, the PoF rotates about the axis G from position PoF1 to position PoF2; the “Scheimpflug line” moves from position S1 to position S2. The axis of rotation has been given many different names: “counter axis” (Scheimpflug 1904), “hinge line” (Merklinger 1996), and “pivot point” (Wheeler).|$|E

50|$|A {{camera lens}} can provide sharp focus on {{only a single}} plane. Without tilt, the image plane (containing the film or image sensor), the lens plane, and the plane of focus are parallel, and are {{perpendicular}} to the lens axis; objects in sharp focus are {{all at the same}} distance from the camera. When the lens plane is tilted relative to the image plane, the plane of focus (PoF) is at an angle to the image plane, and objects at different distances from the camera can all be sharply focused if they lie in the same plane. With the lens tilted, the image plane, lens plane, and PoF intersect at a common line;this behavior has become known as the Scheimpflug principle. When focus is adjusted with a tilted lens, the PoF rotates about an axis at the intersection of the lens's <b>front</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> and a plane {{through the center of the}} lens parallel to the image plane; the tilt determines the distance from the axis of rotation to the center of the lens, and the focus determines the angle of the PoF with the image plane.

50|$|A {{telescope}} {{with only}} one curved mirror, such as a Newtonian telescope, will always have aberrations. If the mirror is spherical, it will suffer from spherical aberration. If the mirror is made parabolic, to correct the spherical aberration, then it must necessarily suffer from coma and astigmatism. With two non-spherical mirrors, such as the Ritchey-Chrétien telescope, coma can be eliminated as well. This allows a larger useful field of view. However, such designs still suffer from astigmatism. This too can be cancelled by including a third curved optical element. When this element is a mirror, {{the result is a}} three-mirror anastigmat. Alternatively, a Ritchey-Chretien may use one or several low-power lenses in <b>front</b> of the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> as a field-corrector to correct astigmatism and flatten the focal surface, as for example the SDSS telescope and the VISTA telescope; this can allow a field-of-view up to around 3 degrees diameter.|$|R

40|$|A {{programmable}} illuminating system (PIS) uses {{a commercial}} multimedia projector {{together with a}} suitable optical relay system in order to illuminate specimens under microscope with transmitted light. The theoretical part of the diploma thesis describes some methods used in the optical transmission microscopy.

An optical and mechanical design of the optical relay system used for PIS is introduced. The experimental part shows the results made with two different PIS arrangements.

40|$|Darkfield {{illumination}} (DF) is {{a preferred}} method to visualize faint structures which are hardly {{seen in the}} brightfield (BF) mode. In DF the sample is illuminated by a tilted beam and the BF is blocked by an objective aperture. Thus, the image is formed by the scattered beam from the sample only. To provide a symmetrical (annular) DF two ways are possible: either a ring-shaped illumination aperture which provides an annular tilted beam on the specimen (Fig. 3) is used, or the beam is conically rotated on the specimen (dynamical method). This paper describes a new DF which can be performed by a Köhler illumination system (KIS) and has numerous advantages over the standard methods provided by conventional illumination systems. In the KIS [1] the cross-over (emission pattern) is always imaged by the condenser lens system into the <b>front</b> <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> of the final condenser lens (objective pre-field lens) which means the size (illumination angle), position (beam incidence), and the shape (conical DF) of this image defines the illumination conditions.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} recovering 3 D motion and structure for rigid curves. For this purpose, we use long monocular sequences of images of the curve and compute some set of derivatives (up to the second order) that are defined on the so-called spatio-temporal surface generated by the curve. For general 3 D rigid curves, there is exactly one constraint for each image point that relates these derivatives to the kinematic screw and its first order time derivative. These equations derive directly from the perspective equations. However, this theory ignores (as does the projective model of cameras) {{the fact that the}} viewed object must be entirely in <b>front</b> of the <b>focal</b> <b>plane.</b> In this paper, we provide a complete description (up to second order) of these conditions and of their geometrical consequences for 3 D reconstruction. Moreover, the relations between the geometry of the image curve and the kinematic screw are investigated. We show that ignoring these constraints leads to erroneous solutions with a high probability even when using perfect data. Then, an algorithm which takes advantage of these constraints is proposed. The accuracy of the obtained results is demonstrated on both synthetic and real image sequences...|$|R

The ETM+ payload {{is similar to}} the TM sensors on previous Landsat satellites and incorporates two new devices to improve its absolute radiometric calibration. The Full Aperture Solar Calibrator (FASC) is a deployable diffuser panel. This device has been deployed 9 times to date, with a normal deployment schedule of once per month. The initial analysis of the FASC data has given absolute calibration results within 5 % of the prelaunch integrating sphere calibrations and a range of variation of 2 % between dates. The Partial Aperture Solar Calibrator (PASC), is a set of auxiliary optics that allows the ETM+ to view the sun through a reduced aperture. Data have normally been acquired on a daily basis with the PASC. Initial results with the PASC were encouraging, despite some unexpected saturation in the shortest wavelength band. The response of the ETM+ short wavelength (silicon) bands to the PASC increased initially and has begun to decrease in some of these bands. The longer wavelength (InSb) bands have shown up to 30 % oscillations that vary between detectors within the band. Studies are ongoing to better characterize the response to the PASC. The ETM+ also incorporates an internal calibrator (IC), a shutter that oscillates in <b>front</b> of the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> that directs light from the internal calibrator lamps to the <b>focal</b> <b>plane.</b> The responses to this device are also varying, though differently than the PASC results.
