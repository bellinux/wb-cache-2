Also, the straightness of the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is improved by lifting the base side of the column. Modal analysis is done to find the natural frequencies. And thermal analysis is done to obtain temperature distributions and thermal deformation due to heat sources.

The deformation of the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is reduced by adding ribs and the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is stable for vibration because the machine has high natural frequency. It is confirmed that the ultra-precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> with linear motion guide applied is very stable for thermal deformation...|$|R

Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. Using {{aspheric}} {{component in}} optical system can correct optical aberration, acquire high imaging quality, improve the optical characteristic, simplify system structure, and reduce system volume. Nowadays, high-precision surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> {{is an important}} approach to processing optical aspheric elements. However, because {{of the characteristics of}} optical aspheric elements, the processing method makes a higher demand to whole performance of surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine,</b> and hardly to achieve ideal machining effect. Taking high generality and efficiency into account, this paper presents a compensation method for machining errors of high-precision surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine,</b> which bases on optical aspheric elements, to achieve high-precision machining for all kinds of optical aspheric elements. After compensation, the <b>machining</b> accuracy of <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> could reach 2 um/ 200 x 200 mm. The research bases on NC surface <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> which is self developed. First of all, this paper introduces machining principle for optical aspheric elements on the <b>grinding</b> <b>machine.</b> And then error sources which producing errors are analyzed. By contacting and non-contacting measurement sensors, measurement software which is self designed realizes on-position measure for grinded workpiece, then fits surface precision and machining errors. Through compensation software for machining error which is self designed, compensation algorithm is designed and translated compensation data into G-code for the high-precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> to achieve compensation machining. Finally, by comparison between machining error compensation before and after processing, the experiments for this purpose are done to validate the compensation machining accuracy...|$|R
500|$|With its new railway links, Altrincham and the {{surrounding}} areas became desirable places for the middle classes and commuters to live. Professionals and industrialists moved to the town, commuting into Manchester. While some travelled daily by coach, the less well–to–do commuted by express or [...] "flyer" [...] barges from Broadheath. Between 1851 and 1881 the population increased from 4,488 to 11,250. Broadheath's industrial area, covering about , was founded in 1885 by Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford, to attract businesses. By 1900 Broadheath had its own docks, warehouses and electricity generating station. The site's proximity to rail, canal and road links proved attractive to companies making machine tools, cameras and <b>grinding</b> <b>machines.</b> The presence of companies like Tilghmans Sand Blast, and the Linotype and Machinery Company, established Broadheath as an industrial area of national standing. By 1914, 14companies operated in Broadheath, employing thousands of workers. One of those was the Budenberg Gauge Company. Linotype also created 172workers' homes near its factory, helping cater for the population boom created by Broadheath's industrialisation. Between 1891 and 1901 the population of Altrincham increased by 35per cent, from12,440 to16,831.|$|E
500|$|The American Machinist {{reported}} in 1922 that The Churchill Machine Tool Co was [...] "now almost the only specialist in precision <b>grinding</b> <b>machines</b> in Great Britain" [...] {{and that the}} uses of the process in the railway industry {{for the production of}} axle journals were by that time accepted as best practice and that the usage of it for piston rods and cylinders was being established. A summary-box to the article says that: [...] The Carborundum Company and Pratt & Whitney companies are referred to in the article, perhaps demonstrating that Churchill could not operate in isolation despite the [...] "only specialist" [...] status accorded to them early in the article. Supplying grinding machinery to railways, for use in new production and refurbishment of worn mechanisms, became an important new area of operations: post-war government sales of used machinery had flooded the domestic market for machine tools, but exports, initially to Indian railways and then elsewhere, went some way towards softening the blow, and the Churchill companies, whilst scarred, were able to ride out the worst of the post-war recession. Among the more unusual supplies made was a universal grinding machine used to grind the valves of trumpets for the Salvation Army.|$|E
