50|$|Cooktown Municipal Council was {{established}} in 1876, but the earliest recorded stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> work dates to 1884, during a boom {{period in which the}} Cooktown Municipal Council commenced a number of civic improvements, including a water supply system; stormwater <b>kerbing,</b> <b>channelling</b> and drains; footpaths; street lighting; and wharf extensions.|$|R
50|$|The stone <b>kerbing,</b> <b>channels</b> and {{footbridges}} of Charters Towers {{were listed}} on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.|$|R
5000|$|The Stone <b>kerbing,</b> <b>channels</b> and {{footbridges}} of Charters Towers is a heritage-listed {{group of}} water infrastructure at various locations throughout Charters Towers, Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from [...] to 1930s. It {{was added to}} the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.|$|R
50|$|The early granite <b>kerbs,</b> <b>channels</b> and {{footbridges}} at Charters Towers {{is important}} in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, especially {{the important role of}} Charters Towers, once a prosperous gold mining centre and the second largest town in Queensland, in the development of far north Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|It {{contributes}} also to {{the uniqueness}} of Cooktown, and as such is valued by the local community as {{an important element of}} Cooktown's history and identity. That the community values the early <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> is evident in the actions of the Cook Shire Council, which since the 1970s has been constructing new granite <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> to complement the earlier work.|$|R
50|$|Most of Cooktown's early granite <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> was {{constructed}} between 1884 and 1905. Particularly fine {{examples of this}} work are evident in Charlotte, Hogg, Furneaux, and Green Streets, but {{the full extent of}} the work is much wider, and early <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> which is now below present street levels continues to be uncovered as new streetwork is undertaken.|$|R
50|$|Early Granite <b>Kerbing</b> and <b>Channelling,</b> Cooktown is a heritage-listed set of {{rainwater}} management structures at Adelaide, Charlotte, Furneaux, Green, Helen, Hogg, Hope and Walker Streets and Webber Esplanade, Cooktown, Shire of Cook, Queensland, Australia. It {{was built}} from 1884 to 1905 by Thomas Pascoe. It {{is also known}} as Early Granite <b>Kerbing</b> and <b>Channelling.</b> It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 April 1997.|$|R

50|$|The {{granite stone}} <b>kerbs,</b> <b>channels</b> and {{footbridges}} at Charters Towers {{contributes to the}} overall aesthetic quality of the historic streetscapes of Charters Towers and provides {{a high degree of}} unity to the townscape in its material and design. It contributes also to the distinctiveness of Charters Towers, and as such is valued by the local community and visitors to the historic mining town as an important element of Charters Tower's history and identity.|$|R
50|$|The Early Granite <b>Kerbing</b> and <b>Channelling</b> of Cooktown {{was listed}} on the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 April 1997 having {{satisfied}} the following criteria.|$|R
50|$|The {{masonry work}} {{was carried out}} by either day labour or by contractors. The stone was {{reportedly}} quarried nearby, but its exact location is yet to be determined. The network of footbridges that remains in the city today provides details of how early residents of Charters Towers made their way around the city during the wet season, from house yards, across footpaths, over <b>kerbs,</b> <b>channels,</b> and streets to gain access to all parts of the city for work and pleasure.|$|R
50|$|The early granite <b>kerbs</b> and <b>channels</b> at Charters Towers are {{important}} in demonstrating the development of early drainage methods in mining towns in far north Queensland in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The early granite <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> has {{aesthetic}} significance, {{contributing to}} the overall aesthetic and amenity of the historic streetscapes of Cooktown and providing {{a high degree of}} unity to the townscape in its material and design.|$|R
50|$|As some Cooktown street {{levels have}} been raised, {{there is the}} {{possibility}} that sub-strata <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> exist with the potential to extend the current body of knowledge about this early civic work and the work of the Cooktown Municipal Council in general.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of stone <b>kerb</b> and <b>channelling</b> is rare on far northern goldfields and survives as {{testimony to the}} desire for a permanent settlement in the region. Other structural remains are well represented and better documented than at other abandoned mining centres in north Queensland.|$|R
50|$|Such {{extensive}} and early use of granite <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling,</b> illustrating the confidence and optimism of local business and civic {{leaders in the}} future of Cooktown in the late 19th century, is unknown in any other town of far North Queensland, and therefore is significant for its rarity value.|$|R
50|$|As the {{population}} of the town waned following the end of the mining boom in 1907 many areas of the town were abandoned however the stone <b>kerbs,</b> <b>channels</b> and footbridge at Charters Towers continued to be maintained by the Charters Towers City Council. During the Depression of 1929 the Charters Towers City Council conducted maintenance work on the Gill and Deane Street intersection. The date 1929 is etched in the concrete. A number of the timber footbridges in Charters Towers were also replaced at this time with pre-stressed concrete. In 1990s the Council widened Deane Street, north of Gill Street, with no effect {{on the nature of the}} open channels. A steel safety fence replaced the original timber structure. It is not known when the original timber bridge was replaced.|$|R
50|$|Streetscape {{improvements}} {{were completed}} by the City in 2014, including widened footpaths, new footpath and street lighting, landscaping reflecting Feng Shui principals, event power and water connections, upgrades to underground services, undergrounding of overhead power lines and flush <b>kerb</b> and <b>channels.</b> The streetscape design facilitates Chinatown to hold large scale events.|$|R
50|$|As the {{intention}} {{was for the}} town to revert to farmland, there were many 'temporary' features. For example, instead of putting in <b>kerbing,</b> <b>channels,</b> and footpaths {{at the edge of}} the road, a single expanse of seal was contoured in a very flat 'W' shape: the seal was highest at the outer edge (footpath) and in the middle (centreline), with a lower area serving as a channel and delineation between the roadway and footpath. Likewise, most of the town's telephone local loop is strung above ground to save the task of burying and then removing the lines. Most houses were prefabricated, and intended to be portable. Some were brought from Otematata, and some were later moved to Clyde for the next hydroelectricity project. However, in 1983, as the hydroelectric project was winding up, residents successfully fought to save the town itself.|$|R
50|$|Cooktown's early <b>kerb</b> and <b>channelling</b> is {{constructed}} of granite, a granular igneous rock composed mainly of feldspar (orthoclase) and quartz. The kerb blocks are typically 200mm thick and 600mm {{long and the}} channelling is formed from various sized slabs. The early kerbing has shallow drill holes, indicating that the stone was probably drilled by hand.|$|R
50|$|The building, {{located in}} the main {{commercial}} street in Cooktown, contributes aesthetically to an historical streetscape which includes the adjacent Seagren's Building and nearby Westpac Bank; the Cook Shire Council Chambers, Mary Watson's Monument and the former Cooktown Post Office {{on the opposite side}} of the street; and the early stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> in Charlotte Street.|$|R
50|$|In Hogg Street {{adjacent}} to section 15 the normal <b>kerb</b> and <b>channel</b> becomes a drainage channel formed {{on both sides}} of the channel with granite and measures 400mm deep by 1100mm wide. At the intersection of Hogg and Charlotte Streets is a particularly fine granite boxed culvert, and at the intersection of Adelaide and Hogg Streets, an early stone-pitched dish drain.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral is {{constructed}} from basalt, which {{was obtained from}} the local Corporation Quarry and which was commonly used for <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling.</b> It was less frequently used for buildings owing to the difficulties in applying it to construction. As such St Patrick's is a rare example of a basalt building and demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement for the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The early granite <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> at Cooktown is {{important}} in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, especially {{the important role of}} Cooktown, once a prosperous regional centre and port, in the development of far North Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The work was initiated in the mid-1880s when the Cooktown Municipal Council commenced a number of other civic improvements, including a water supply system, street lighting and wharf extensions.|$|R
50|$|The {{city council}} {{commissioned}} a town plan from Ronald McInnes in 1934. It {{was based on}} Britain's Town Planning Act of 1932 {{and was the first}} town plan designed for an existing city in Queensland, serving as a model for other cities for many years. The Mackay City Council undertook an ambitious plan for the beautification and modernisation of the city. The scheme included the provision of new parks, <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling,</b> new water mains, a new powerhouse and the establishment of the sewerage system.|$|R
50|$|The early granite kerbs and {{channeling}} at Charters Towers {{is important}} in Queensland's history for its rarity value. Such extensive use of granite kerbs and channeling, illustrating the confidence and optimism of local business and civic leaders {{in the future of}} Charters Towers in the late 19th century, is known only in the far north Queensland town of Cooktown, where granite <b>kerbs</b> and <b>channels</b> were constructed between the period 1884 and 1910. Together they are significant as a rare and uncommon aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage.|$|R
5000|$|Charters Towers was a {{principal}} gold mining centre from 1872 to 1907 and by 1901 it was Queensland's second largest town. The stone <b>kerbs</b> and <b>channels</b> are significant in highlighting {{the areas of}} the town that were settled during the town's mining heyday. Most of the early granite kerbing and channeling at Charters Towers was constructed between [...] and [...] Particularly fine examples of this work are evident with the original one square mile of the municipality, namely: Hodgkinson, Church, High, Lee, Bow, Anne, Mary and Deane Streets.|$|R
40|$|Up {{to three}} credit points are {{available}} {{for the use of}} slag products in concrete if the material cost of the concrete represents more than 1 % of the project’s contract value. Up to two points {{are available for}} the use of blast furnace slag as a SCM, while one point is awarded for the use of slag aggregates in concrete. The credit addresses all concrete uses including precast, cast in-situ or prestressed, and includes structural and non-structural uses such as paving, footpaths, <b>kerbs,</b> <b>channels</b> and gutters. Credit points are awarded on the following basis: •	 One	Point is available where the Portland cement content is reduced by 30 % (by replacement with a suitable quantity of GGBFS) compared to the reference case (presented in Table 1). •	 Two	Points are available where the Portland cement content is reduced by 40 % (by replacement with a suitable quantity of GGBFS) compared to the reference case in Table 1. •	 One	Point is available when at least 40 % of the coarse aggregate in the concrete is crushed slag aggregate, measured across all mixes in the project, provided that the use of Portland cement is not increased by more than 5 kg/ m 3. Credit points are awarded on the premise of Portland cement content reductions, rather than the quantity of ground slag used. 1...|$|R
50|$|The urban {{improvement}} works {{carried out}} by Ithaca Town Council extended over two decades. They included the planting of street trees by the Council itself, sealing of roads and improvements to footpaths and drainage. More mundane works such as forming and metalling, laying concrete <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling,</b> and footpath widening along Kelvin Grove Road were carried out {{over a number of}} years. The road featured in the surviving Mayoral reports for 1917, 1918 and 1921. The report of 1917 had commented that Kelvin Grove Road was very rough in places. By 1921 Mayor John Tait could report that Kelvin Grove Road had been metalled to the Town boundary.|$|R
50|$|The {{channeling}} to {{the streets}} from the slopes of Towers Hill directs storm-water runoff down the granite <b>kerbs</b> and <b>channels</b> along Deane Street. At the intersection of Deane and Gill Street, a large stone- pitched underground drain carries the water underneath Gill Street. The storm-water then flows along a steep stone-pitched open drain the length of Deane Street to the western boundary of Lissner Park. This opens into a wide stone-pitched open drain along the northern boundary of Lissner Park, formerly Mosman Creek. This northern end of town receives a large quantity of storm-water from the elevated areas {{of the town and}} was the original confluence of Deane Creek and Mosman Creek.|$|R
50|$|Cook Shire Council Chambers {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Charlotte Street, the {{principal}} street in Cooktown, on a site that slopes down towards the Endeavour River at the rear. It contributes to the streetscape and forms a visual grouping with the adjacent 1887 Post and Telegraph Office to the north. It is located within a group of culturally significant buildings and civic works, including the adjacent post office and north of this the former Daintree Divisional Board's offices, Mary Watson's Monument (1886) on the nearby road reserve, the stone <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> along Charlotte Street (1880s), and on the other side of the street, the former Seagren's Building (1880s), the former Bank of North Queensland (1892) and the former Queensland National Bank (1892).|$|R
50|$|During the 1890s the Cooktown Municipal Council {{extended}} {{the work of}} <b>kerbing</b> and <b>channelling</b> the town's principal streets. In {{the second half of}} 1890 Thomas Pascoe was contracted to cut 500 yards of stone kerbing at 2/8 per yard, a standard price for this work, and in the same period he constructed a culvert in Hill street for £45. A council quarry in Hope Street was operating at this period. In the second half of 1891 Cleary, Brown & Smith were contracted to split and stack 500 yards of kerbing at 2/8 per yard. In October 1892 the Council voted a sum of £50 for work in Hope Street and 50 feet of kerbing was constructed along the southern side of Hogg Street from the corner of Hope Street. Early in 1893 two men were employed by the council to cut kerbing for future road works. By early April that year they had cut 159 yards of kerbing and 54 yards of pitching. Between mid-1894 and mid-1895, 271 yards of kerbing was constructed in upper Charlotte Street, and in November 1895 kerbing was constructed along the southern side of Green Street from Charlotte Street. Further kerbing along the eastern side of Charlotte Street, between Green and Furneaux Streets, was undertaken August-September 1896.|$|R
5000|$|The seventh bridge (No 7) is the 1889 Show Street Bridge, {{a single}} lane road bridge that {{is located on}} the southeastern corner of the Charters Towers Show Grounds. The {{original}} timber bridge has been replaced. Today the bridge is a beam bridge and consists of a 40 cm thick slab of pre-stressed concrete approximately 6 m wide and 6.6 m long on three concrete piers. The Show Bridge is orientated north- south. The original granite stone-pitched open drain and approaches are still evident underneath the bridge. A single round steel post safety rail, painted white, has been placed {{on either side of the}} bridge. The eighth bridge (No 8) is the Mary Street Bridge, which is a pedestrian footbridge located on the north side of Mary Street between King Street and Stubley Street. It is a simple beam bridge that is constructed from a steel deck supported by two concrete piers. Inscribed into the western pier is [...] "EAT 95". The bridge is orientated east-west. A single round steel post safety rail is located on either side of the bridge. The handrail is 104 cm high. The drain underneath the footbridge has been lined with concrete, however there are stone pitched <b>kerbs</b> and <b>channels</b> on the southern side of the footbridge.|$|R
