25|$|In January 2013, Fred Fairgood—now {{retired as}} {{principal}} of Westview High—suffered a major stroke and was clinging to {{life at the}} hospital; he is later shown to be recovering at home, although he is disabled. As Fred was beginning his recovery, a woman identifying herself as Fred's daughter (from a previous relationship, before he married Ann) {{shows up at the}} hospital and proves that she is indeed his biological daughter. Ann Fairgood is forced to admit that her marriage to Fred was not the happy one they had made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> publicly and that they shielded Darin from their unhappiness, upsetting Darin to the point he estranges himself from the family.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 King Charles Emmanuel IV {{was ousted}} from Piedmont by the French army, and moved his court to Cagliari (his brother and {{successor}} Victor Emmanuel I returned to Turin only in 1814). At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari were restored. In 1823, Victor Emmanuel I issued the editto delle chiudende (Enclosures Act), a legislative act that abolished all community latifundias, introducing the private property and provoking heavy protests from Sardinians. In 1847, under King Charles Albert, with the so-called Perfect fusion were abolished all the administrative differences between Sardinia and the Italian mainland: this manoveur has been made <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only one possible in order to grant equal rights to all inhabitants of the Kingdom, that would become a unitary state and the basic legislation of the future united Italy as well.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade.

He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this is not}} nearly as bad an episode as many people are making <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> but it’s not exactly a sterling piece of work, either. It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else. But in my opinion, it’s better than 'Lord of the Flies'." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if she thought about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E
2500|$|According to Carol L. Tilley, Wertham [...] "manipulated, overstated, compromised, and {{fabricated}} evidence" [...] {{in support}} of the contentions expressed in Seduction of the Innocent. He misprojected both the sample size and substance of his research, making <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more objective and less anecdotal than it truly was. [...] He generally did not adhere to standards worthy of scientific research, instead using questionable evidence for his argument that comics were a cultural failure.|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{appreciated}} {{the fact the}} writers {{did not make a}} big deal of defining either characters' sexuality or their romantic relationship. Show creator Rothenberg said labels and gender are not a factor in the series, which Debnam-Carey viewed as true to the story. [...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are and not what they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters. It is representative of the world that we live in today, but it also doesn't make <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this statement—it's not a social/cultural statement," [...] she said. [...] "It is just that in this world, some things are a little better after the apocalypse [...] It kind of represents, in a way, an ideal place where people love people and it doesn't have to be a thing, which I think is really great." ...|$|E
