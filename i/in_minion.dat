50|$|The DreamWorks logo {{features}} a boy {{sitting on a}} crescent moon while fishing. The general idea for the logo {{was the idea of}} company co-founder Steven Spielberg, who wanted a computer generated image. Illustrator Robert Hunt was commissioned to execute the idea as a painting and from this work, who the artist used his son as the model. The logo was then turned into a motion graphic at Industrial Light and Magic, in collaboration with Kaleidoscope Films, Dave Carson and Clint Goldman. It was animated by ILM animation supervisor Wes Takahashi. Music accompanying the logo to start live-action DreamWorks movies was specially composed by John Williams; the DreamWorks Animation logo has music from the Harry Gregson-Williams/John Powell score for the 2001 film Shrek.

50|$|The current {{most common}} methods for {{examining}} methylation state require an assay that fragments DNA before standard second generation sequencing on the Illumina platform. As {{a result of}} short read length, information regarding the longer patterns of methylation are lost. Third generation sequencing technologies offer the capability for single molecule real-time sequencing of longer reads, and detection of DNA modification without the aforementioned assay.Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION {{has been used to}} detect DNAm.

Prior to this, and since {{the closure of the}} Gonamena incline, trains from Cheesewring Quarry to Moorswater had to reverse <b>in</b> <b>Minions</b> village and again on the Phoenix line.

40|$|Extensional (table) {{constraints}} are {{an important}} tool for attacking combinatorial problems with constraint programming. Recently there has been renewed interest in fast propagation algorithms for these constraints. We describe the use of two alternative data structures for maintaining generalised arc consistency on extensional constraints. The first, the Next-Difference list, is novel and has been developed with this application in mind. The second, the trie, is well known but its use {{in this context is}} novel. Empirical analyses demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting approaches, both in GACschema, and in the watched-literal table constraint <b>in</b> <b>Minion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Long-read {{sequencing}} {{is rapidly}} evolving and reshaping the suite {{of opportunities for}} genomic analysis. For the MinION in particular, as both the platform and chemistry develop, the user community requires reference data to set performance expectations and maximally exploit third-generation sequencing. We performed an analysis of MinION data derived from whole genome sequencing of Escherichia coli K- 12 using the R 9. 0 chemistry, comparing the results with the older R 7. 3 chemistry. Methods: We computed the error-rate estimates for insertions, deletions, and mismatches <b>in</b> <b>MinION</b> reads. Results: Run-time characteristics of the flow cell and run scripts for R 9. 0 {{were similar to those}} observed for R 7. 3 chemistry, but with an 8 -fold increase in bases per second (from 30 bps in R 7. 3 and SQK-MAP 005 library preparation, to 250 bps in R 9. 0) processed by individual nanopores, and less drop-off in yield over time. The 2 -dimensional (“ 2 D”) N 50 read length was unchanged from the prior chemistry. Using the proportion of alignable reads as a measure of base-call accuracy, 99. 9 % of “pass” template reads from 1 -dimensional (“ 1 D”)  experiments were mappable and ~ 97 % from 2 D experiments. The median identity of reads was ~ 89 % for 1 D and ~ 94 % for 2 D experiments. The total error rate (miscall + insertion + deletion) decreased for 2 D “pass” reads from 9. 1 % in R 7. 3 to 7. 5 % in R 9. 0 and for template “pass” reads from 26. 7 % in R 7. 3 to 14. 5 % in R 9. 0. Conclusions: These Phase 2 MinION experiments serve as a baseline by providing estimates for read quality, throughput, and mappability. The datasets further enable the development of bioinformatic tools tailored to the new R 9. 0 chemistry and the design of novel biological applications for this technology.
