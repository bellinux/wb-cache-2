5|$|In genetics, a <b>genome-wide</b> {{association}} study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a <b>genome-wide</b> set of genetic variants in different individuals {{to see if any}} variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.|$|E
5|$|Classic <b>genome-wide</b> linkage {{analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. <b>Genome-wide</b> association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Convergence {{occurs at}} the level of DNA and amino acids. In 2013 the first <b>genome-wide</b> study of {{convergence}} was published. Comparisons of the genomes of echolocating bats and the dolphin identified numerous convergent amino acid substitutions in genes implicated in hearing and vision.|$|E
5|$|A <b>genome-wide</b> {{association}} {{study of}} more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene KLB, which encodes the transmembrane protein β-Klotho, as highly associated with alcohol consumption. The protein β-Klotho is an essential element in cell surface receptors for hormones involved in modulation of appetites for simple sugars and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Genome-scale RNAi {{research}} {{relies on}} high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. RNAi HTS technology allows <b>genome-wide</b> loss-of-function screening and is broadly {{used in the}} identification of genes associated with specific phenotypes. This technology has been hailed as the second genomics wave, following the first genomics wave of gene expression microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery platforms.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of <b>genome-wide</b> RNAi {{libraries}} can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named <b>genome-wide</b> association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
25|$|Gene {{expression}} and <b>genome-wide</b> H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 {{were found to}} be extremely similar between ES and iPS cells.|$|E
25|$|CTNNA2 encodes for a brain-expressed α-catenin {{that has}} been {{associated}} with Excitement-Seeking in a <b>genome-wide</b> association study (GWAS) of 7860 individuals.|$|E
25|$|Several {{candidate}} gene {{studies have found}} associations between idiopathic scoliosis and genes mediating bone formation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue structure. Several <b>genome-wide</b> studies have {{identified a number of}} loci as significantly linked to idiopathic scoliosis. In 2006 idiopathic scoliosis was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene (encoding for Matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were identified through a <b>genome-wide</b> association study.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} genes have been {{associated}} with eczema, one of which is filaggrin. <b>Genome-wide</b> studies found three new genetic variants associated with eczema: OVOL1, ACTL9 and IL4-KIF3A.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Behar et al. on the <b>genome-wide</b> {{structure}} of Jews {{observed that the}} Beta Israel had levels of the Middle Eastern genetic clusters similar to the Semitic-speaking Tigrayans and Amharas.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} modern dog breeds has been {{difficult}} to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830–1900). In 2010, a study looked at 48,000Single nucleotide polymorphisms that gave a <b>genome-wide</b> coverage of 912dogs representing 85breeds.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{detection}} of epigenetic marks in microorganisms is possible with single molecule real time sequencing, in which polymerase sensitivity allows for measuring methylation and other modifications as a DNA molecule is being sequenced. Several projects {{have demonstrated the}} ability to collect <b>genome-wide</b> epigenetic data in bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Variation in craniofacial form {{between humans}} {{has been found}} to be largely due to differing {{patterns}} of biological inheritance. Modern cross-analysis of osteological variables and <b>genome-wide</b> SNPs has identified specific genes, which control this craniofacial development. Of these genes, DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3, PAX1 and PAX3 were found to determine nasal morphology, whereas EDAR impacts chin protrusion.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Behar et al. on the <b>genome-wide</b> {{structure}} of Jews {{observed that the}} Beta Israel had similar levels of the Middle Eastern genetic clusters as the also Semitic-speaking Ethiopian non-Jewish Tigreans and Amharas. However, compared to the Cushitic-speaking non-Jewish Ethiopian Oromos, who are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, the Beta Israel had higher levels of Middle Eastern admixture.|$|E
25|$|Gene-set {{analysis}} (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) {{has been}} shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. <b>genome-wide</b> bisulfite sequencing); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genome-wide</b> {{association}} {{studies examining}} single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found around one hundred genes associated with RA risk, {{with most of}} them involving the HLA system (particularly HLA-DRB1) which controls recognition of self versus nonself molecules; other mutations affecting co-stimulatory immune pathways, for example CD28 and CD40), cytokine signaling, lymphocyte receptor activation threshold (e.g., PTPN22), and innate immune activation appear to have less influence than HLA mutations.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Price et al. sampled Southern Italians, Jews and other Europeans, and {{isolated}} the genetic markers {{that are most}} accurate for distinguishing between European groups, achieving results comparable to those from <b>genome-wide</b> analyses. It mines much larger datasets (more markers and more samples) to identify a panel of 300 highly ancestry-informative markers which accurately distinguish not just northwest and southeast European, but also Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry from Southern Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Although twin {{studies and}} family studies have {{indicated}} a large degree of heritability for schizophrenia, the exact genetic causes remain unclear. Recently however, quite some large-scale studies have now begun to unravel the genetic underpinnings for the disease. Important segregation should be made between lower risk, common variants (identified by candidate studies or <b>genome-wide</b> association studies(GWAS)) and high risk, rare variants (which could be caused by de novo mutations) and copy-number variations (CNVs).|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to predict {{the likelihood of a}} DNA sequence forming a Z-DNA structure. An algorithm for predicting the propensity of DNA to flip from the B-form to the Z-form, ZHunt, was written by Dr. P. Shing Ho in 1984 (at MIT). This algorithm was later developed by Tracy Camp, P. Christoph Champ, Sandor Maurice, and Jeffrey M. Vargason for <b>genome-wide</b> mapping of Z-DNA (with P. Shing Ho as the principal investigator).|$|E
25|$|Large-scale {{epigenome}} mapping {{efforts are}} under way {{around the world and}} have been organized under the Human Epigenome Project. This is based on a multi-tiered strategy, whereby bisulfite sequencing is used to obtain high-resolution methylation profiles for a limited number of reference epigenomes, while less thorough analysis is performed on a wider spectrum of samples. This approach is intended to maximize the insight gained from a given amount of resources, as high-resolution <b>genome-wide</b> mapping remains a costly undertaking.|$|E
25|$|QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a {{quantitative}} approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from <b>genome-wide</b> methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy /bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/qdmr>. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective {{tool for the}} high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR {{can be used as}} an effective tool for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples.|$|E
25|$|As an {{autoimmune}} disease, {{susceptibility to}} SS is {{greatly influenced by}} the human leukocyte antigen. DQA1*05:01, DQB1*02:01, and DRB1*03:01 alleles were identified as risk factors, while DQA1*02:01, DQA1*03:01 and DQB1*05:01 alleles {{were found to be}} protective factors for the disease. The relationship between alleles and specific race was also established. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-B8 are generally found in Caucasian patients, while HLA-DR5 is related to Greek and Israeli patients. Multiple <b>genome-wide</b> association scans may be conducted in the future to identify key risk variants.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete {{reprogramming}}: reprogramming {{also faces}} {{the challenge of}} completeness. This is particularly challenging because the <b>genome-wide</b> epigenetic code must be reformatted {{to that of the}} target cell type in order to fully reprogram a cell. However, three separate groups were able to find mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-derived iPS cells that could be injected into tetraploid blastocysts and resulted in the live birth of mice derived entirely from iPS cells, thus ending the debate over the equivalence of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPS with regard to pluripotency.|$|E
25|$|No {{agreement}} using modern DNA: In 2016, a whole-genome {{study of}} wolves and dogs concluded that admixture had confounded {{the ability to}} make inferences about the place of dog domestication. Past studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, <b>genome-wide</b> similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower linkage disequilibrium might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that the analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{strategies}} have been employed to identify essential genes on a <b>genome-wide</b> basis: directed deletion of genes and random mutagenesis using transposons. In the first case, individual genes (or ORFs) are completely deleted from the genome {{in a systematic}} way. In transposon-mediated mutagenesis transposons are randomly inserted in as many positions in a genome as possible, aiming to inactivate the targeted genes (see figure below). Insertion mutants that are still able to survive or grow are not in essential genes. A summary of such screens {{is shown in the}} table.|$|E
25|$|The {{advances}} in bisulfite sequencing {{have led to}} the possibility of applying them at a <b>genome-wide</b> scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as Restriction landmark genomic scanning. The mapping of the human epigenome is seen by many scientists as the logical follow-up to the completion of the Human Genome Project. This epigenomic information will be important in understanding how the function of the genetic sequence is implemented and regulated. Since the epigenome is less stable than the genome, it is thought to be important in gene-environment interactions.|$|E
25|$|Different {{fields in}} {{epidemiology}} have {{different levels of}} validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast <b>genome-wide</b> association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.|$|E
25|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} been used to conduct <b>genome-wide</b> analyses of mRNAs – unprocessed and processed – thus providing insights into alternative splicing. For example, results from use of deep sequencing indicate that, in humans, an estimated 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, with a number of pre-mRNA transcripts spliced in a tissue-specific manner. Functional genomics and computational approaches based on multiple instance learning have also been developed to integrate RNA-seq data to predict functions for alternatively spliced isoforms. Deep sequencing has also aided in the in vivo detection of the transient lariats that are released during splicing, the determination of branch site sequences, and the large-scale mapping of branchpoints in human pre-mRNA transcripts.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s and {{the first}} several years of this millenium, {{microsatellites}} were the workhorse genetic markers for <b>genome-wide</b> scans to locate any gene responsible for a given phenotype or disease, using segregation observations across generations of a sampled pedigree. Although the rise of higher throughput and cost-effective single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platforms led to {{the era of the}} SNP for genome scans, microsatellites remain highly informative measures of genomic variation for linkage and association studies. Their continued advantage lies in their greater allelic diversity than biallelic SNPs, thus microsatellites can differentiate alleles within a SNP-defined linkage disequilibrium block of interest. Thus, microsatellites have successfully led to discoveries of type 2 diabetes (TCF7L2) and prostate cancer genes (the 8q21 region).|$|E
25|$|Functional {{genomics}} is a {{field of}} molecular biology that attempts {{to make use of}} the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their <b>genome-wide</b> approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional “gene-by-gene” approach.|$|E
25|$|Off-targeting {{is another}} {{challenge}} {{to the use of}} siRNAs as a gene knockdown tool. Here, genes with incomplete complementarity are inadvertently downregulated by the siRNA (in effect, the siRNA acts as a miRNA), leading to problems in data interpretation and potential toxicity. This, however, can be partly addressed by designing appropriate control experiments, and siRNA design algorithms are currently being developed to produce siRNAs free from off-targeting. <b>Genome-wide</b> expression analysis, e.g., by microarray technology, can then be used to verify this and further refine the algorithms. A 2006 paper from the laboratory of Dr. Khvorova implicates 6- or 7-basepair-long stretches from position 2 onward in the siRNA matching with 3'UTR regions in off-targeted genes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{periodically}} expressed {{genes are}} driven by transcription factors that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects. <b>Genome-wide</b> studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression. The expression profiles of these transcription factors {{are driven by}} the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{evolution}} of light skin has followed different genetic paths in European and East Asian populations. Two genes however, KITLG and ASIP, have mutations associated with lighter skin that have high frequencies in both European and East Asian populations. They {{are thought to have}} originated after humans spread out of Africa but before the divergence of the European and Asian lineages around 30,000 years ago. Two subsequent <b>genome-wide</b> association studies found no significant correlation between these genes and skin color, and suggest that the earlier findings may have been the result of incorrect correction methods and small panel sizes, or that the genes have an effect too small to be detected by the larger studies.|$|E
25|$|Two large <b>genome-wide</b> {{association}} studies linking {{single nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) to prostate cancer were published in 2008. These studies identified several SNPs which substantially affect the risk of prostate cancer. For example, individuals with TT allele pair at SNP rs10993994 were reported to be at 1.6 times higher risk of prostate cancer than those with the CC allele pair. This SNP explains part of the increased prostate cancer risk of African American men as compared to American men of European descent, since the C allele is much more prevalent in the latter; this SNP {{is located in the}} promoter region of the MSMB gene, thus affects the amount of MSMB protein synthesized and secreted by epithelial cells of the prostate.|$|E
