40|$|INTRODUCTION: Arm support like <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> {{may improve}} arm {{movements}} during stroke rehabilitation. It is unknown how <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> affects muscle activation patterns during reach and retrieval movements. Since muscle activity during reach {{is represented by}} a component varying with movement velocity and a component supposedly counteracting gravity, we hypothesized that <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> decreases the amplitude of muscle activity, but {{does not affect the}} pattern. To examine this, we compared muscle activity during well defined movements with and without <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> in healthy elderly. METHODS: Ten subjects performed reach and retrieval movements with and without <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation.</b> Muscle activity of biceps, triceps, anterior, middle and posterior parts of deltoid and upper trapezius was compared between the two conditions. RESULTS: The level of muscle activity was lower with <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> in all muscles, reaching significance in biceps, anterior deltoid and trapezius (p 0. 026). The muscle activation pattern did not differ between movements with and without <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> (p 0. 662). DISCUSSION: <b>Gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> only influenced the level of muscle activity but not the muscle activation pattern in terms of timing. Future studies should examine if the influence of <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> is comparable for stroke patients. This may stimulate early and intensive training during rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Background. Arm {{support to}} help {{compensate}} {{for the effects of}} gravity may improve functional use of the shoulder and elbow during therapy after stroke, but <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> may alter motor control. Objective. To obtain quantitative information on how <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> influences muscle activation patterns during functional, 3 -dimensional reaching movements. Methods. Eight patients with mild hemiparesis performed 2 sets of repeated reach and retrieval movements, with and without unloading the arm, using a device that acted at the elbow and forearm to compensate for gravity. Electromyographic (EMG) patterns of 6 upper extremity muscles were compared during elbow and shoulder joint excursions with and without <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation.</b> Results. Movement performance was similar with and without <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation.</b> Smooth rectified EMG (SRE) values were decreased from 25 % to 50 % during movements with <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> in 5 out of 6 muscles. The variation of SRE values across movement phases did not differ across conditions. Conclusions. <b>Gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> did not affect general patterns of muscle activation in this sample of stroke patients, probably since they had adequate function to complete the task without arm support. <b>Gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> did facilitate active arm movement excursions without impairing motor control. <b>Gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> may be a valuable modality in conventional or robot-aided therapy to increase the intensity of training for mildly impaired patients...|$|E

Zur Untersuchung der Supinationsbewegungen vor und nach einer vierwöchigen Trainingsphase wurde eine Supinationsplattform konstruiert, mit der sowohl statische als auch dynamische Supinationsbewegungen induziert werden konnten. Zur Auswertung wurden Kraft-, Goniometer- und EMG-Messungen herangezogen. Die Trainingsgruppen, die mit dem Airex Balance-Pad® und dem Thera-Band® trainierten, erzielten während isometrischer Maximalkrafttests eine isometrische Maximalkraftsteigerung der Peronealmuskulatur, einhergehend mit erhöhten Kraftanstiegsraten und erhöhten EMG-Aktivitäten. Gleichzeitig konnten für beide Trainingsgruppen erhöhte EMG-Peronealktivitäten in statischen und dynamischen Supinationsbewegungen nachgewiesen werden. Die Parcour-Gruppe hingegen veränderte in allen Versuchsbedingungen die EMG-Aktivität der Peronealmuskulatur nicht. Für alle Trainingsgruppen konnten jedoch signifikant reduzierte Supinationswinkel und -geschwindigkeiten während dynamisch induzierter Supinationsbewegungen ermittelt werden.

The {{present study}} was designed to investigate the effects of different preventive training programs on suddenly induced ankle inversion. For this investigation a supination platform was constructed that allowed static and dynamic ankle inversions. EMG-, goniometer- and force-data were recorded before and after a four week training. For two training groups (balance-pad and thera-band), isometric force measurements showed an increased maximal force of the m. peronaeus longus (PL) in combination with an increase in force rise rate and EMG-activity. Increased EMG-activity (PL) was also observed during suddenly induced ankle inversions in static and dynamic situations. For the third training group (has been trained on a special course), no changes in EMG-activity of the m. peronaeus longus could be measured in all experimental conditions. However, for all training groups significantly reduced inversion angles and inversion velocities could be detected during dynamically induced ankle inversions.

However, intuitively controlled and fully actuated arm supports are currently not commercially available and adults with DMD are limited to use external robotic arms which contribute to the disuse of their arms. To fill this gap {{in the field of}} arm supports, we have developed EMGand force-based control interfaces that have been implemented in two new active arm supports: the A-Arm and the Active A-Gear. We found that both EMGand force-based control interfaces are feasible solutions for the control of active arm support for adults with DMD that have lost their arm function a long time ago. The comparative studies between EMG and force-based control interfaces indicated that, in general, EMG-based control interfaces are better suited for adults with DMD than force-based control interfaces as they are experienced as less fatiguing. Nevertheless, force-based control interfaces with active <b>gravity</b> and joint-stiffness <b>compensation</b> can be a better alternative for those cases in which voluntary forces would still be higher than the intrinsic forces of the arms. This conclusion has an indicative value, as it is based on a low number of subjects.

In conclusion, by developing these new control interfaces and implementing them in new active assistive devices, we made a significant step in improving arm supports for adults with DMD.

Robot manipulators hold a strong similarity with arm prosthetics, we used a 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) whole arm manipulator to test our HMI in the execution of reaching and grasping tasks. We showed that the interface worked under different control strategies using several velocity profiles. The system was tested by ten subjects with encouraging results. We analysed {{the performance of the}} 7 -DOF robot manipulator {{in order to determine the}} suitability of its application in the development of this project. The original setup of the manipulator worked under joint Proportional and Derivative (PD) control but considering the results of the initial analysis of the system we proposed two alternative control strategies aimed to improve the performance of the manipulator: a feedforward friction compensation technique and joint Proportional Integral and Derivative control (PID). We created a dynamic model of the 7 -DOF manipulator in Simmechanics in order to have a better understanding of the system. The friction phenomena of the manipulator was identified, represented through a fitted model and included in the system’s model with the aim of incrementing its accuracy with respect to the real system. The characteristics of the model made it suitable to test and to design control strategies for motion and friction compensation in MATLAB/Simulink. The model of the system was validated using data from the real robot arm and it was used later to tune the PID controllers of the joints of the 7 -DOF manipulator using Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT). Both experimental data and model simulations were used for the tuning procedure considering two different approaches.

Our previous work indicated that surface electromyography (sEMG) and force-based control with active <b>gravity</b> and joint-stiffness <b>compensation</b> were feasible solutions for the support of elbow movements (one degree of freedom). In this paper, we extend the evaluation of sEMG- and force-based control interfaces to simultaneous and proportional control of planar arm movements (two degrees of freedom). METHODS: Three men with DMD (18 - 23 years-old) with different levels of arm function (i. e. Brooke scores of 4, 5 and 6) performed a series of line-tracing tasks over a tabletop surface using an experimental active arm support. The arm movements were controlled using three control methods: sEMG-based control, force-based control with stiffness compensation (FSC), and force-based control with no compensation (FNC). The movement performance was evaluated in terms of percentage of task completion, tracing error, smoothness and speed. RESULTS: For subject S 1 (Brooke 4) FNC was the preferred method and performed better than FSC and sEMG. FNC was not usable for subject S 2 (Brooke 5) and S 3 (Brooke 6). Subject S 2 presented significantly lower movement speed with sEMG than with FSC, yet he preferred sEMG since FSC was perceived to be too fatiguing. Subject S 3 could not successfully use neither of the two force-based control methods, while with sEMG he could reach almost his entire workspace. CONCLUSIONS: Movement performance and subjective preference of the three control methods differed with the level of arm function of the participants. Our results indicate that all three control methods have to be considered in real applications, as they present complementary advantages and disadvantages. The fact that the two weaker subjects (S 2 and S 3) experienced the force-based control interfaces as fatiguing suggests that sEMG-based control interfaces could be a better solution for adults with DMD.

This paper only considers the applicability of a passive magnetic solution for this high force <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> application, or, more specifically, the influence of various PM array topologies on the force density. Further, fast-solving analytical models are presented and consequently are used to illustrate the feasibility of using passive permanent magnets for <b>gravity</b> <b>compensation</b> in this demanding high precision industrial application...|$|E
40|$|While plate tectonic {{theory has}} been {{developed}} considerably {{in the last four}} decades, the of initiation of subduction remains an enigma. In this thesis, I investigate the possible initiation of subduction of North Atlantic oceanic lithosphere at the Scotian basin off east coast of Canada. On the basis of the relationships between topography, gravity and magnetic anomalies, in both space and Fourier domains, a crustal model is proposed to explain the long- and intermediate-wavelength components of the gravity anomalies of eastern Canada which takes into account the topography, density perturbations in the crust and upper mantle and Moho undulation with certain degree of compensation. No pronounced correlation is observed between the reduced-to-pole magnetic anomalies and topography, as well as between the magnetic anomalies and the vertical gradient of gravity anomalies. The low magnetic susceptibility beneath suture zones indicates thermal demagnetization of the high-magnetic crustal root. The above topography and gravity analysis method is used to determine the compensation state of the Scotian basin. A 3 -D density model that incorporates seawater, sediments, oceanic and continental crust and the lithosphere down to 35 km depth is established, which together with density perturbations inside the crust and mantle of the model, produce the observed <b>gravity</b> anomalies. Regional <b>compensation</b> is required to explain the observations. A 2 -D thin elastic plate model is adopted to investigate the flexural response of the lithosphere subjected to the loads due to the sediments and excess density perturbations. The rigidity of the lithosphere beneath the basin is estimated to be about one to two orders of magnitude smaller than elsewhere. The weakening is due to thermal blanketing effects of the thick sediments and the temperature-dependent rheology of lithosphere. The weak lithosphere would have a controlling effect on reactivation of normal faults at the ocean-continent boundary. The possible re-orientation of the spreading ridge of North Atlantic ocean may produce tensional stresses that would decouple the oceanic lithosphere from the continental one at the weak zone, allowing the lithosphere beneath the basin to bend more. Subduction initiation would be facilitated when taking into account further weakening of the lithosphere by extra sediments and subsequent compression. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
