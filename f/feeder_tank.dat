5000|$|The [...] "Wampus-Kat" [...] was a {{twin engine}} {{conventional}} landing gear-equipped biplane with folding wings. There are ailerons on both {{upper and lower}} wings. The wooden fuselage had a small nose-mounted door that allowed access for four passengers inside and one pilot in an open cockpit above. All surfaces are fabric covered except the cabin. The main fuel tank was below the fuselage with a small gravity <b>feeder</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
5000|$|All three [...] Panhard-Levassor 12Cb V-12 engines were mounted {{midway between}} the wings {{in the central}} section on steel frames. The outer two were in tractor {{configuration}} and the central one, mounted above the fuselage, was a pusher. They had rectangular radiators in front of them. Each drove a four blade propeller. In order for the central propeller to clear the fuselage the central engine was mounted higher than the others and the chord of the upper wing reduced to provide a trailing edge cut-away for propeller clearance. Their three 530 L fuel tanks were in the fuselage forward and aft of the space for bombs, passengers or cargo; fuel was pumped from these to a <b>feeder</b> <b>tank</b> in the upper wing so that the engines could be gravity fed.|$|E
50|$|The {{landing gear}} was very robust, {{in order to}} {{withstand}} catapult launches (takeoffs) and recoveries (landings) needed for carrier operations. It comprised a double nosewheel and widely spaced single main wheels. There were no hardpoints on the sweeping parts of the wings, and so all the armament is fitted on the belly between the air intake ramps and on pylons under the wing gloves. Internal fuel capacity is 2400 gal L: 290 gal L in each wing, 690 gal L {{in a series of}} tanks aft of the cockpit, and a further 457 gal L in two <b>feeder</b> <b>tanks.</b> It can carry two 267 gal L external drop tanks under the engine intake ramps. There is also an air-to-air refueling probe, which folds into the starboard nose.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{being seen}} {{frequently}} in the aquarium trade, skunk loach are very aggressive fish and not suitable for community aquarium tanks. Smaller fish and bottom <b>feeders</b> in the <b>tank</b> can be attacked or killed. Suitable tank mates for the skunk loach include larger cichlid species. Caves can be good hiding places.|$|R
50|$|Feeder- The Feeder is {{essentially}} a collection pan for the drilling fluid before it is processed by the shaker, it can come in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate {{the needs of the}} mud system. The most commonly used feeder is known as the weir feeder, the drilling fluid enters the feeder usually through a pipe welded to the outside wall {{near the bottom of the}} <b>feeder</b> <b>tank,</b> it fills the feeder to a predetermined point and like water flowing over a dam the mud (drilling fluid) spills over the weir and onto the screening area of the shaker. This method of feeding the shaker is most widely used due to its ability to evenly distribute the mud along the entire width of the shaker allowing for maximum use of the shaker's screening deck area.|$|E
5000|$|These {{fuel tanks}} {{consisted}} of eighteen removable rubberized-compound containers, called cells, installed inside the main {{wings of the}} airplane, nine to each side. The main wings of the B-17 consisted of an [...] "inboard wing" [...] structural panel mounted to the fuselage and mounting the engines and flaps, and an [...] "outboard wing" [...] structural panel joined to the inboard wing and carrying only the ailerons. The Tokyo tanks were installed {{on either side of}} the joint (a load-bearing point) where the two wing portions were connected. Five cells, totalling 270 gal capacity, sat side by side in the outboard wing and were joined by a fuel line to the main tank delivering fuel to the outermost engine. The sixth cell was located in the space where the wing sections joined, with the remaining three cells located side-by-side within the inboard wing, and these four cells delivered 270 gal of fuel to the <b>feeder</b> <b>tank</b> for the inboard engine. The same arrangement was repeated on the opposite wing. The Tokyo tanks added 1,080 gal of fuel to the 1,700 gal carried in the six regular wing tanks and the 820 gal that could be carried in a tank that could be mounted in the bomb bay, for a combined total of 3,600 gal.|$|E

40|$|Industry widely uses {{rotary valves}} and blow tanks for the {{pneumatic}} conveying of products, each having their {{pros and cons}} depending on the specific application. This article shows the differing results obtained when low-velocity conveying a product through a common pipeline using both a drop-through rotary valve and a bottom-discharge blow <b>tank</b> <b>feeder.</b> A number of issues arise in the rotary valve system, the main one being rotary valve air leakage. A blow tank system, on the other hand, does not leak, as it is an enclosed system. The experimental results show dramatic differences in product throughput. Further exploration leads to a novel modification being made to the rotary valve system {{in an attempt to}} increase its capacity. The result of this modification shows a slight increase in output tonnage, but still significantly less than that obtained from the blow tank...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} pirarucu's (Arapaima gigas) ability {{to trigger a}} self-feeding system to regulate protein intake between two standard diets that contained 39 % and 49 % of crude protein. The same system allowed the evaluation of daily feeding and locomotor activity rhythms. Eighteen fish (654. 44 ± 26. 85 g) were distributed into six 250 L tanks (3 fish/tank). Fish had free access to both diets (39 % vs. 49 % protein) by <b>feeders</b> (2 per <b>tank),</b> adapted to be activated by fish themselves. This system was connected to a computer system. After an adaptation period, fish learned to activate feeders and the mean food intake recorded was 2. 14 % of their body weight on a daily basis. Fish showed feeding (72. 48 %) and locomotor (72. 49 %) activity predominantly during the daytime, and daily variations of choice between diets, but fixed a protein intake feeding target at 44. 53 %. These results should be considered when discussing feeding behavior, feeding schedules and diet intake regulations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Determination the {{hydraulic}} performance of an irrigation network requires adequate {{knowledge about the}} sensitivities of the network structures. Hydraulic sensitivity concept of structures and channel reaches aid network operators in identifying structures with higher sensitivities which will attract more attention both during network operation and maintenance program. Sluice gates are frequently used as regulator and delivery structures in irrigation networks. Usually discharge coefficient of sluice gate is considered constant {{in the design and}} operation stage. Investigation of sensitivity of offtakes and cross-regulators has carried out by various researchers and some hydraulic sensitivity indicators have been developed. In the previous researches, these indexes were developed based on constant coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates. However, the coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates depend on gate opening and the upstream water depth. So, in this research, some hydraulic sensitivity indicators at structure based on variable coefficient of discharge for free flow sluice gates were developed and they were validated by using observed data. Materials and Methods: An experimental setup was constructed to analyses the performance of the some hydraulic sensitivity. The flume was provided with storage reservoir, pumps, electromagnetic flowmeter, entrance <b>tank,</b> <b>feeder</b> canal, delivery canals, offtakes, cross-regulators, collector reservoir, piezometric boards. The flume is 60. 5 m long and the depth of that is 0. 25 m, of which only a small part close to offtake and Cross-regulators was needed for these tests. Offtakes and Cross-regulators are free-flowing sluice gates type. Offtakes were located at distances 20 m and 42. 5 m downstream from the entrance tank, respectively. and, Cross-regulators were located 2 m downstream from each offtakes. The offtakes are 0. 21 m and Cross-regulators are 0. 29 m wide. The upstream and downstream water levels at gates were measured with piezometer taps. There is a collector reservoir downstream of each delivery canal that was equipped with a 135 V-notch weir as a measuring device. The flow was provided by a pump having maximum capacity 35 lit/s, and was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter of 0. 5...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste ensaio foi avaliar cinco dietas, sendo quatro delas compostas por milho moído fino e com fontes distintas de fibra para cada ração e um tratamento com milho inteiro (MI). As fontes de fibras utilizadas foram: 1) bagaço de cana in natura (BIN); 2) resíduo de milho verde (RM); 3) casca de soja (CS) e 4) caroço de algodão (CA). Foram utilizados cinco animais castrados da raça Nelore, com peso médio de 195 kg e com fístula ruminal. Os animais foram distribuídos em baias individuais cobertas dotadas de comedouros individuais e bebedouros para cada duas baias. O período {{experimental}} teve duração de dezenove dias com dez dias de adaptação e nove dias de coletas. Durante o intervalo de coletas foram avaliados o comportamento ingestivo, o pH ruminal, o nitrogênio amoniacal, os ácidos graxos de cadeia curta, a contagem total de protozoários ruminais, o pH fecal, a digestibilidade no trato total, bem como o consumo de MS, PB, EE, FDN e FDA. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o quadrado latino 5 x 5 e para comparações de médias foi utilizados o teste Duncan a 5 % de probabilidade. O tratamento BIN teve maior CMS que RM, CS e CA (P 0, 05). O maior consumo de FDN foi para o tratamento BIN. O consumo de FDA foram maiores para BIN e RM. Observou-se certa rejeição do caroço de algodão pelos animais, comprovado pelo menor consumo de FDN e FDA no tratamento CA (P 0, 05). O tratamento CA apresentou uma maior DMS que CS (P 0, 05). Quanto ao comportamento ingestivo, os tratamentos RM e BIN foram os que obtiveram os maiores tempos de atividade mastigatória (p 0, 05). Os tratamentos MI e CA não diferiram de RM e CS (P> 0, 05), quanto ao pH ruminal. Na contagem de protozoários os maiores números foram observados pelos tratamentos CS (P 0, 05). Quanto ao butirato, ao nitrogênio amoniacal e ao pH fecal não foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre os tratamentos (P> 0, 05). Conclui-se que o bagaço de cana foi a fonte de fibra que conseguiu manter um bom valor de pH, de contagem de protozoários, além de maior consumo de matéria seca e digestibilidade semelhante aos demais tratamentos. Portanto nos níveis testados o tratamento BIN se mostrou igual ao controle MI, no entanto foi mais eficiente quando comparado das demais fontes de fibras. This {{trial was}} {{realized in the}} veterinary and animal science school at Universidade Federal de Goias. The objective was to evaluate five diets, four of these diets was composed by ground corn with different fiber sources for each ration and one control treatment with whole corn (MI) without fiber source. The fiber sources used was sugar cane bagass (BIN), industrial corn residue silage (RM), soybean hulls (CS), cotton seed (CA). Five castrated Nellore steers {{with an average of}} 195 kg of body weight and with rumen fistulae, were used in this trial. The animals were distributed in individual pen provided of individual covered <b>feeder</b> and water <b>tank</b> for each two animals. Each period spent 19 days, with 10 days for food adaptation and nine days for collect of data. During the interval of collects were evaluated: feed behavior, ruminal pH, ammoniacal nitrogen, short chain of fatty acids, total counting of protozoa, fecal pH, total digestibility and dry mater, crude protein (PB), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (FDN) and acid detergent fiber (FDA) intakes. Latin square and Duncan test for 5 % of probability were used for statistical analysis. The treatment BIN had the highest dry matter intake, although CA had the lowest value. The ether extract intake was highest for MI treatment, followed by CA and the CS had the lowest value. The highest values for FDN and FDA intakes were in treatment BIN. It was observed some rejection of cotton seed by the animals. The values for total digestibility for CA, RM, BIN, CS and MI treatments were 68. 50; 66. 19; 65. 87; 64. 20 e 56. 15. The treatment CA showed greater DMD than CS (P 0. 05). In protozoa counting the highest numbers were observed for CS and BIN treatments. Although the lowest numbers for protozoa counting was founded for CA. Animal differences were noted in protozoa counting. The highest values for total short chain fatty acids were founded for CS, that was the same of RM (P> 0. 05), although BIN, MI and CA had the lowest value. Highest xiv values for propionate and acetate were found in CS treatment. The acetate:propionate ratios were higher in BIN, but for the others treatments the value didn´t differed between them (P> 0. 05). Butyrate, ammonia nitrogen and fecal pH any differences were found (P> 0. 05). It was concluded that sugar cane bagasse was the fiber source that keep a good result for ruminal pH, protozoa counting, dry matter intake and the total digestibility wasn´t different from the others. According to that we can conclude that sugar cane bagasse showed more efficient than the others fiber sources in the tested levels...|$|R
