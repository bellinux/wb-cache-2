5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

One {{factor in this}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> human language growth is based upon conceptual ideas and hypothetical structures, both being far greater capabilities in humans than animals. This appears far less common in animal communication systems, although current research into animal culture is still an ongoing process with many new discoveries.|$|E
25|$|An achilles {{heel of the}} Indian {{nuclear power}} programme, however, {{is the fact that}} they are not signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This has many times in their history {{prevented}} them from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding their use of nuclear industry. Another consequence of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of their programme has been domestically developed, much like their nuclear weapons programme. United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.|$|E

25|$|Efforts of federal, {{state and}} local governments, working in {{partnership}} through the Chesapeake Bay Program, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and other nonprofit environmental groups, to restore or at least maintain the current water quality have had mixed results. One particular obstacle to cleaning up the Bay <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the polluting substances arise far upstream in tributaries lying within states {{far removed from the}} Bay. Despite the state of Maryland spending over $100 million to restore the Bay, conditions have continued to grow worse. Twenty years ago, the Bay supported over six thousand oystermen. There are now fewer than 500.|$|E
25|$|Ish {{spends most}} of his elderly life in a fog, unaware of the world. Superstition has set in; the tribe has reverted to a {{traditional}} lifestyle, hunting with dogs and bow and arrow. Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the gun, whose cartridges do not always work. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone. But he also wonders if the new world <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes.|$|E
25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay to clean it up, which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E

500|$|A view often held {{by those}} who reject the {{evidence}} for global warming <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the temperature increase seen in land based thermometers {{could be due to}} an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas. For example, Ross McKitrick and Patrick J. Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface-temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators, and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend (for 1979–2002) could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the corrected temperature data set they studied—which had already been processed to remove the (modeled) UHI contribution. Critics of this paper, including Gavin A. Schmidt, have said the results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation. McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that [...] "the evidence for contamination of climatic data is robust across numerous data sets." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{eruption}} {{devastated the}} nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini, which was entombed in {{a layer of}} pumice. It is believed that the eruption also severely affected the Minoan population on Crete, but {{the extent of the}} impact is debated. Early theories proposed that ashfall from Thera on the eastern half of Crete choked off plant life, causing starvation of the local population. However, after more thorough field examinations, the theory has lost credibility, as it has been determined that no more than [...] of ash fell anywhere on Crete. Other theories have been proposed based on archeological evidence found on Crete indicating that a tsunami, likely associated with the eruption, impacted the coastal areas of Crete and may have devastated the Minoan coastal settlements. Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the damage done to Minoan sites resulted from a large earthquake and the fires it caused, which preceded the Thera Eruption.|$|E
500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, {{on all kinds of}} things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book...."

2500|$|LBOs {{have become}} {{attractive}} as they usually represent {{a win-win situation}} for the financial sponsor and the banks: the financial sponsor can increase the rate of returns on his equity by employing the leverage; banks can make substantially higher margins when supporting the financing of LBOs as compared to usual corporate lending, because the interest chargeable <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> higher.

Today, Christian naturism contains various members associated with most denominations.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{distance}} the new edition from the less commercially and critically successful {{aspects of the}} West End Game line, and to discourage new players from wasting time and money on what he considered to be inferior products, Varney additionally used the designer's notes to declare many West End products, including the [...] "Fifth Edition" [...] and everything published for the 2nd Edition after The People's Glorious Revolutionary Adventure, to be [...] "unproducts" [...] - no longer part of the game's continuity, and not recommended for use with the new edition. An upshot of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the poorly received metaplot established late in the West End Games line, from the Secret Society Wars to the Reboot and beyond, was disposed of. Varney has explained that this is due mainly to his distaste for the direction the metaplot took the game line in, a distaste he asserts is shared by the game's fan community. He has also stated that he personally has little affection for the [...] "Zap" [...] style, and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook, although later supplements for Paranoia XP did provide more support for Zap play.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Christmas {{season by}} {{definition}} runs until January 6 (Epiphany), and is observed {{until at least}} New Year's Eve by the public, almost all broadcasters skip the last Twelve Days of Christmas, abruptly ending all holiday music at or even before midnight on December 25, and not playing a single Christmas song again until the next November. (Several radio stations actually promote this, with ads that proudly proclaim to listeners weary of the Christmas music that the station's regular format will indeed return on December 26, as soon as Christmas Day is over.) It {{is not uncommon for}} broadcasters to market the twelve-day period preceding Christmas (December 14 to 25) as the [...] "Twelve Days of Christmas", contrary to the traditional definition. One reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> popular Christmas music is so closely associated with Christmas Day itself that it would be difficult or impossible to play after December 25 without bringing up references that the broadcaster may wish to ignore (such as those that involve Santa Claus, who has already come and gone by Christmas morning). On occasion, some Christmas music stations will continue to play at least some Christmas music through the weekend following Christmas, or even through New Year's Day (particularly when stunting in anticipation of a format change; see below), but never any later.|$|E
