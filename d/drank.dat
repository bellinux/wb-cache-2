5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and <b>drank</b> her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality).

40|$|Objectives: We {{examined}} {{whether a}} sugary <b>drink</b> limit {{would still be}} effective if larger-sized <b>drinks</b> were converted into bundles of smaller-sized <b>drinks.</b> Methods: In a behavioral simulation, participants were offered varying food and <b>drink</b> menus. One menu offered 16 oz, 24 oz, or 32 oz <b>drinks</b> for sale. A second menu offered 16 oz <b>drinks,</b> a bundle of two 12 oz <b>drinks,</b> or a bundle of two 16 oz <b>drinks.</b> A third menu offered only 16 oz <b>drinks</b> for sale. The method involved repeated elicitation of choices, and the instructions did not mention a limit on <b>drink</b> size. Results: Participants bought significantly more ounces of soda with bundles than with varying-sized <b>drinks.</b> Total business revenue was also higher when bundles rather than only small-sized <b>drinks</b> were sold. Conclusions: Our research suggests that businesses have a strong incentive to offer bundles of soda when <b>drink</b> size is limited. Restricting larger-sized <b>drinks</b> may have the unintended consequence of increasing soda consumption rather than decreasing it...|$|R
50|$|<b>Drink</b> mixers are the non-alcoholic {{ingredients}} in mixed <b>drinks</b> and cocktails. There {{are many reasons}} mixers are used.

Some mixers change the texture or consistency of the <b>drink,</b> making it thicker or more watery. <b>Drink</b> mixers may also be used strictly for decorative purposes by changing the color or appearance of the <b>drink.</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} intake and patterns in consumption of potentially erosive beverages in school children in the Netherlands. METHODS: A cross-sectional, single centre study was performed among 502 school children in Rotterdam, in age varying between 12 and 19 years. Data on consumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks,</b> sports <b>drinks</b> and alcopops were obtained through a self-reported questionnaire. Gender- and age-related differences in consumption were analysed with Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Associations between variables were investigated with Chi-square tests and Spearman's rank order correlation analysis. RESULTS: Boys consumed soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks</b> and sports <b>drinks</b> more frequently than girls, and on average also consumed higher amounts of these <b>drinks.</b> No gender-related differences were observed in alcopop consumption. Consumption of all <b>drinks</b> was most frequent at 14 - or 15 -year of age, {{with the exception of}} alcopops which was most frequent by 16 -year-old school children. Significant positive associations were observed between the consumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks</b> and/or sports <b>drinks.</b> Alcopop consumption was only associated with consumption of energy <b>drinks.</b> CONCLUSION: onsumption of soft <b>drinks,</b> energy <b>drinks,</b> sports <b>drinks</b> and alcopops by school children is related to age and gender. The significant positive associations between the consumption of these <b>drinks</b> suggest that a subgroup of school children exists with a high cumulative intake of these potentially erosive <b>drinks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> intake {{has changed}} the {{children}} eating habits.

The study included labels of carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> n = 33 – sugar <b>drinks</b> (n = 21) or diet <b>drinks</b> (n = 12) – of five different flavors. All carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> evaluated have sodium in its composition.
