5|$|Gunpowder {{was used}} to loosen the marl, which was then removed by steam shovels. Various other steam-powered devices were used to remove mud, clay and rock. All the <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> was used for {{embankments}} and quay roads around the docks. The mud was placed behind these, and in trenches to seal the works from water, using special side-tipping wagons.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} the Iron Age is marked by the initial use of iron in any region, whether brought in from elsewhere, or by {{evolution}} of the smelting process in that region. As ancient writers considered {{that they were in}} the Iron Age, they did not define an end to it. This convention prevailed in modern archaeology as well. Iron is still the major <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> in use in modern civilization, and steel is a vital and indispensable modern industry.|$|E
25|$|Tungsten carbide {{and other}} {{carbides}} are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive {{and much more}} brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for drill-bit tips, small pieces of <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> fixed or brazed onto {{the tip of a}} bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably PCB manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1mm, solid carbide bits are used.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Conducted {{laboratory}} {{studies of the}} threading {{in the details of}} ship machinery and ship armatures from <b>hard</b> <b>materials</b> helped to create the modern technology of internal threads of small diameters cutting. The reasons that impede the processing of <b>hard</b> <b>materials</b> are find out. Presented are various designs of taps for cutting of internal threads and analyzed is their work. Noted are shortcomings of their designs resulting in creating a modern cutting pattern, allowing to minimize the shortages identified in the processing of <b>hard</b> <b>materials.</b> Practice shows that the machining of these materials is difficult because of their considerable tendency to work hardening during deformation, high viscosity, poor heat dissipation from the cutting zone. They have a low coefficient of thermal conductivity and low coefficient of workability relatively to tool steel. Therefore, processing technology and cutting conditions used for structural carbon steels, often are unacceptable to <b>hard</b> <b>materials.</b> The most difficult is tapping into the holes of small diameters up to 16 mm. The disadvantage of this technology is the low quality of threaded surfaces and an increased tendency to tap breakage. To improve threading performance in the details of the <b>hard</b> <b>materials</b> are developed advanced threading techniques.  </p...|$|R

2500|$|Because spinners do {{not want}} the ball to grab onto the lane with its surface, they often use [...] "plastic" [...] bowling balls - balls with the older {{polyester}} cover-stock popular in the 1970s and 1980s, and commonly used as house balls today - in comparison to the widely used polyurethane, [...] "particle" [...] (polyurethane with nigh-microscopic glass spheres or other <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> throughout the coverstock) and [...] "reactive resin" [...] balls ("reactive resin" [...] is itself polyurethane manufactured using a process to leave microscopic pores throughout it, essentially, a hard sponge) used by bowlers who desire a ball that will grip the lane and roll strongly. Additionally, because the chances of injury are somewhat elevated with this style of bowling, as well as the advantage of ball deflection with this style, the spinner will have a tendency to use lightweight balls between ten and twelve pounds.|$|E

60|$|We {{were sitting}} on a bank of the Charles River, fishing. The soft melancholy red of evening was fading off in streaks on the glassy water, and the houses of Oldtown were {{beginning}} to loom through the gloom, solemn and ghostly. There are times and tones and moods of nature that make all the vulgar, daily real seem shadowy, vague, and supernatural, as if the outlines of this <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> present were fading into the invisible and unknown. So Oldtown, with its elm-trees, its great square white houses, its meeting-house and tavern and blacksmith's shop and milly which at high noon seem as real and as commonplace as possible, at this hour of the evening were dreamy and solemn. They rose up blurred, indistinct, dark; here and there winking candles sent long lines of light through the shadows, and little drops of unforeseen rain rippled the sheeny darkness of the water.|$|E
60|$|The strict {{dependence}} of writing, indeed, upon the material employed is nowhere better shown {{than in the}} case of the Assyrian cuneiform inscriptions. The ordinary substitute for cream-laid note in the Euphrates valley in its palmy days was a clay or terra-cotta tablet, on which the words to be recorded--usually a deed of sale or something of the sort--were impressed while it was wet and then baked in, solid. And the method of impressing them was very simple; the workman merely pressed the end of his graver or wedge into the moist clay, thus giving rise to triangular marks which were arranged in the shapes of various letters. When alabaster, or any other <b>hard</b> <b>material,</b> was substituted for clay, the sculptor imitated these natural dabs or triangular imprints; and that was the origin of those mysterious and very learned-looking cuneiforms. This, I admit, is a palpable digression; but inasmuch as it throws an indirect light on the simple reasons which sometimes bring about great results, I hold it not wholly alien to the present serious philosophical inquiry.|$|E
60|$|Assuredly, this stall of Silas Wegg's was {{the hardest}} little stall of all the sterile little stalls in London.

Of the latter {{commodity}} he had always a grim little heap, on which lay a little wooden measure which had no discernible inside, and was considered to represent the penn'orth appointed by Magna Charta. Whether from too much east wind or no--it was an easterly corner--the stall, the stock, and the keeper, were all as dry as the Desert. Wegg was a knotty man, and a close-grained, with a face carved out of very <b>hard</b> <b>material,</b> that had just as much play of expression as a watchman's rattle. When he laughed, certain jerks occurred in it, and the rattle sprung. Sooth to say, he was so wooden a man that he seemed to have taken his wooden leg naturally, and rather suggested to the fanciful observer, that he might be expected--if his development received no untimely check--to be completely set up with a pair of wooden legs in about six months.|$|E
