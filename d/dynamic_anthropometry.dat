40|$|Thermal comfort {{providing}} {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} uses of energy in building. For giving better human comfort, the suitable operation conditions of air-conditioner are the most important. The quick and right approach is necessary. In this paper, a small office is studied to improve office staff staying for a long period of time and achieve the thermal comfort environment for reducing energy consumption. Commercial software, Solidworks, is utilized for modeling the facilities and the Flow Simulation module for analyzing the air properties of the indoor space. Four types of air-conditioner operation are applied to set the simulated conditions, including exterior temperature, outlet temperature and wind speed of air-conditioner, and location of air-conditioner. Predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percent dissatisfied (PPD) at specific office areas are further acquired through <b>dynamic</b> <b>anthropometry.</b> For seeking the optimal control factors, both of the full factorial method and Taguchi method are utilized to obtain the PMV of specified location. The analyzed result shows the evaluation speed of indoor thermal comfort by Taguchi method is faster than the full-factorial method. It is concluded that software simulation with Taguchi method shows the successful implementation and higher efficiency for thermal comfort assessment...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{advancement}} in laser technology, computer vision, and embedded computing, {{the application of}} laser scanning to the digitization of three dimensional physical realities has become increasingly widespread. In this paper, we focus on research results embodied in a 3 D human body color digitization system developed at Tianjin University, and {{in collaboration with the}} Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. In digital human modeling, the first step involves the acquisition of the 3 D human body data. We have over the years developed laser scanning technological know-how from first principles to support our research activities on building the first 3 D digital human database for ethnic Chinese. The disadvantage of the conventional laser scanning is that surface color information is not contained in the point cloud data. By adding color imaging sensors to the developed multi-axis laser scanner, both the 3 D human body coordinate data and the body surface color mapping are acquired. Our latest development is focused on skeleton extraction which is the key step towards human body animation, and applications to <b>dynamic</b> <b>anthropometry.</b> For dynamic anthropometric measurements, we first use an animation algorithm to adjust the 3 D digital human to the required standard posture for measurement, and then fix the feature points and feature planes based on human body geometric characteristics. Utilizing the feature points, feature planes, and the extracted human body skeleton, we have measured 40 key sizes for the stand posture, and the squat posture. These experimental results will be given, and the factors that affect the measurement precision are analyzed through qualitative and quantitative analyses. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} consumer driven usability {{research conducted}} during {{the development of a}} biometric replacement to PIN numbers to enable the understanding of usability and user acceptance of leading edge biometric verification techniques. The research considered different techniques for security and identified the need for multiple types of evaluation during the design process. Coventry designed the research method and tools, the user interface to the biometric demonstrations and managed their application over a 3 year period. Usability of security is a key area of Coventry’s human-centred evaluation methods research. The other authors contributed knowledge of previous studies; <b>dynamic</b> <b>anthropometry</b> (Graham Johnson) and statistical analysis for fingerswipe (Antonella de Angeli). The work adds to the body of knowledge on the usability of security methods. It shows how usability techniques can be applied and how user opinion is influenced by many factors other than the design. Coventry was subsequently invited to deliver keynotes at the Biometrics annual conference, the Financial Cryptography conference. Her work led to the book chapter: Coventry, L. Usable Biometrics, Chapter in Crannor, and Garfinkel, S. Usability and Security, 2005. This research was the first to explore usability and user expectations in the evaluation of biometric devices. It influenced the development of biometric technology on ATMs and the role of training, marketing and user lead-through in the successful adoption of the technology. Coventry’s approach has been cited and used in speech technology (Carl Turner), biometrics in the air transportation industry (Prof Angela Sasse), personal photos as pictorial passwords (Thomas S. Tullis, Donna P. Tedesco), authentication using graphical passwords, and graphical password systems (Susan Wiedenbeck, Jim Waters, Jean-Camille Birget, Alex Brodskiy, Nasir Memon), multiple graphical passwords (Moncur, and Leplatr...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{design and}} {{validate}} a new video-based tool for quantifying turning during gait {{in people with}} Parkinson's Disease. Dysfunctional turning is common in Parkinson's Disease but most existing measurement tools are inadequate for this group, lack validity and are laboratory-based. Design: Descriptors of turning were identified and the new tool, the Standing-start 180 ° Turn Test (SS- 180), was derived from a short-list. Criterion validity was tested using Cartesian Optoelectronic <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Anthropometry</b> (CODA) as the criterion measure, and intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were tested. Participants: Thirty-two healthy adults (aged 21 – 83 years) and eight people with Parkinson's Disease (aged 69 – 85 years). Results: Seventy descriptors were identified and 20 were short-listed and combined to form four items: Turning Steps, Turn Time, Turn Type and Turn Quality. Time measurements from video and CODA agreed within 0. 5 s on 95 % of occasions in healthy adults and within 20 % {{of each other in}} people with Parkinson's Disease; there was 92 % agreement on Turning Steps and 84 % agreement on Turn Type. Intra-rater reliability was 100 % for Turning Steps, Turn Type and Turn Quality; mean Turn Time difference 0. 1 s (95 % limits of agreement ? 0. 3 to 0. 1 s). Inter-rater reliability was 80 % for Turning Steps, 100 % for Turn Type and 90 % for Turn Quality; mean Turn Time difference 0. 0 s (95 % limits of agreement ? 0. 4 to 0. 5 s). Conclusions: The video-based SS - 180 was developed for measurement in Parkinson's Disease. Preliminary studies suggest that the simple turn test compares well with a laboratory-based criterion measure, and that reliability exceeds similar existing observational analysis tool...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Optimum working heights were determined for domestic kitchen tasks carried out at a sink, worktop and cooker by 24 subjects drawn {{from each of the}} 2. 5 th. 50 th and 97. 5 th percentile stature groups representative of British women. Four independent assessments of working posture were made permitting fine discrimination between the effect of different work levels upon subjects. They were:- (a) electromyography (b) <b>dynamic</b> <b>anthropometry</b> (c) centre of weight displacement. and (d) subjective preferences. All four were statistically significantly correlated with one another. (a) Electromyography The normal comfortable stand at ease posture wes not symmetrical or well balanced. The current British Standard recommended sink height of, 36 inches (914 mm.) was found suitable only for the 2. 5 th percentile group, invoking maximum muscle activity values in certain muscles in subjects from the 50 th and 97. 5 th percentile groups. A flexion-relaxation posture wes recorded for the 50 th and 97. 5 th percentile groups when working at low sink heights. This may be a contributory factor leading to low back disorders. Methods of postural adjustment adopted in aceommodating the various tasks and working heights were identified and evaluated. (b) Dynamic Anthropometric assessments of working postures were derived from photographs of the angular displacement of the main body segments identified by markers superimposed on bony landmarks on each subject. (c) Centre of Weight Displacements were recorded from a stability platform on which the subjects stood during the task performance. Assessments were based on both area and proximity of centre ot weight locations found relative to the position during normal standing at ease. (d) Subjective Preferences for working heights were recorded on the completion of each task at all workstations. General Conclusions No single working height was found suitable for all sections of the female population. A range of appropriate heights is recommended. The four parameters were in complete agreement in the evaluation of tasks undertaken at the sink and showed significant correlation for the other two workstations. The application of these findings is discussed...|$|E
