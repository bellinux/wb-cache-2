[...] SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc. [...] The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided. Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.|$|E

2500|$|A third field {{which plays}} an {{important}} role is neurobiology, specifically the study of the biological vision system. Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and the brain structures devoted to processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals. This has led to a coarse, yet complicated, description of how [...] "real" [...] vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision related tasks. These results have led to a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (e.g. neural net and deep learning based image and <b>feature</b> <b>analysis</b> and classification) have their background in biology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin vocalizes with bird-like whistles, soft chirping sounds, high-pitched trilling, and staccato calls. Researchers describe its repertoire of 38 distinct sounds as unusually sophisticated, conforming to grammatical rules. Jayne Cleveland and Charles Snowdon performed an in-depth <b>feature</b> <b>analysis</b> to classify the cotton-top's repertoire of vocalizations in 1982. They {{concluded that it}} uses a simple grammar consisting of eight phonetic variations of short, frequency-modulated [...] "chirps"—each representing varying messages—and five longer constant frequency [...] "whistles". They hypothesize {{that some of these}} calls demonstrate that the {{cotton-top tamarin}} uses phonetic syntax, while other calls may be exemplars of lexical syntax usage. Each type of call is given a letter signifier; for example, C-calls are associated with finding food and D-calls are associated with eating. Further, these calls can be modified to better deliver information relevant to auditory localization in call-recipients. Using this range of vocalizations, the adults may be able to communicate with one another about intention, thought processes, and emotion, including curiosity, fear, dismay, playfulness, warnings, joy, and calls to young.|$|E

Consequently, system shows the fruit name and a short description to user. Proposed fruit recognition system analyzes, classifies and identifies fruits successfully up to 90 % accuracy. This system also serve as a useful tool in a variety fields such as educational, image retrieval and plantation science...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Incremental {{addition}} of features into a product {{may not be}} an easy task, as its addition may cause changes to many parts of existing components. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) provides effective mechanisms for encapsulating crosscutting concerns and integrating them without modifying existing components. However, it is not sufficient for incremental software development. <b>Feature</b> dependency <b>analysis</b> provides essential information for incremental software development. By tightly coupling <b>feature</b> dependency <b>analysis</b> with AOP, we can support incremental software development. In this paper, we provide specific guidelines on how <b>feature</b> dependency <b>analysis</b> and an AOP technique (i. e., AspectJ) can be combined to support incremental software development. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Polytechnic Kuching Sarawak. The {{theoretical}} framework used in the study was adapted from earlier work by Swales (1990, 1991), Bhatia (1993) and Halliday (1994). The research analyzed the chosen genre (job application letters) from two possible angles; the linguistic features and the rhetorical <b>features</b> <b>analysis.</b> The linguistic <b>features</b> <b>analysis</b> focused on the politeness strategies that appeared in the mini-corpus. Under this analysis, the research focused on four elements that reflect politeness in a job application letter, namely; the salutation, the positive and negative politeness strategies and the complimentary close. The rhetorical <b>features</b> <b>analysis,</b> on the other hand, focused on the rhetorical moves and the rhetorical move sequences that appeared in the mini-corpus. The materials used in the research were letters of application produced by the students. 166 students were selected based on convenient sampling; therefore, the mini-corpus consisted of 166 letters produced by the students. The findings revealed interesting information within the scope of the research. Firstly, under the linguistic analysis, the results indicate although a significant number of students employed linguistic features such as salutation, and complimentary close, there are instances where they are used inappropriately. In addition, the students also included different rhetorical moves in their letters to enable them to achieve the communicative purpose of the letter. The results from the rhetorical <b>features</b> <b>analysis</b> indicate that there are eleven moves that appear in the mini-corpus. Moreover, results of the analysis indicate that even though the sequence of moves may differ from one job applicant to another, in general, there are certain moves patterns that are commonly shared by the students. It {{is important to note that}} genre analysis is not meant to replace other approaches but instead complement them by providing an alternative way in teaching and learning. It is hoped that teachers/lecturers, students, educators and anyone who has interest in the education field may benefit from reading this thesis...|$|R
