500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We knew we had to get him in closer where his talents as a pass rusher could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find in most defensive players." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{one of the}} rehearsals for Toussaint, {{a fellow}} actor {{mentioned}} {{that he had just}} played a part in a Henry Jaglom film. At the time Frederick had not heard of Jaglom, but following the colleague's suggestion that [...] "supposedly, if you write him a letter and tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love his films, he'll cast you in a movie," [...] Frederick wrote to Jaglom. In a three-page letter she extolled the virtues of Jaglom's film Déjà Vueven though she had not actually seen it at the time. To her surprise, Jaglom called her back and invited her to a screening, and soon thereafter gave her a job at his office.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, Powell {{revealed}} that he had spent {{two and a half}} hours explaining to President Bush [...] "the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers." [...] During this discussion, he insisted that the U.S. appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: [...] "I also had to say to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evel Knievel {{took great}} pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life he would {{repeatedly}} talk {{about the importance of}} [...] "keeping his word". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
