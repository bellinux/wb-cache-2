5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was unusual in continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> merge until 1881).|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E

5|$|From {{the spring}} of 1944, the Corps focused {{increasingly}} on fighting the Partisans penetrating Serbia from Bosnia and the Sandžak, and the first clashes with Chetnik <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> occur until 1944. On 5 January 1944, combat with the Partisans in Klenak resulted {{in the deaths of}} three Cossacks of the 1st Regiment. On 18 January, the 5th Regiment was formed in Obrenovac. The 3rd Regiment outfought a 2,400-strong Partisan force advancing towards Jošanička Banja on 31 March. On 28 April, the 1st Regiment prepared defences along the Drina in Zvornik, Bajina Bašta and Loznica areas expecting the 16th and 17th Partisan Divisions to attempt a crossing there. On 30 April, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment was moved to Aleksinac. On 1–2 May, the 5th Regiment fought the Partisans in the village of Mravinci, sustaining casualties of 11 killed and 25 wounded. That summer, the Corps mediated an agreement between one group of Chetniks and the Germans in which the two parties agreed to fight the Partisans in Serbia. On 18 July, the 5th Regiment fought in Jošanička Banja and its regimental headquarters was moved there from Obrenovac, with battalion headquarters being established in Zvečan, Jošanička Banja, Ušće and Vučitrn. Elements of the 3rd and 5th Regiments fought the Partisans on 4–5 August near the village of Rudnik. The Partisans attacked the positions of the 5th Regiment in Leposavić on 24 August.|$|E

25|$|In their {{attempts}} to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions {{with a history of}} conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, {{with the exception of the}} specified <b>groups,</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the requisite traits that would make them warriors.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 and 2006, {{two studies}} by Berglund, Lindström, and Savic used {{positron}} emission tomography (PET) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors, the scent of testosterone found in male sweat, and the scent of estrogen found in female urine. These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> respond to the common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.|$|E
25|$|These {{collective}} attempts, {{as well as}} {{the smaller}} ones, not only faced opposition from the Islamic conservatives, but were sometimes damaged by the leftist and rightist political groups, exemplified by the organization of a demonstration scheduled by the Fedai for the same day as that of the Conference of Unity of Women in December 1979 — despite the pleas mentioned above. In fact, most leftist <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have a well-established vision or plan for pursuing women's rights. The status of women, it was presumed, would be improved automatically by the establishment of an ideal socialist/communist society.|$|E

According to the Economist, over 3,000 people were killed in the public uprising. As a result of the uprising, the new government agreed to sign separate peace treaties with certain insurgent groups. Because the 1988 uprising was mostly politically motivated, ethnic insurgent <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> receive much support from political movements in Myanmar. In the 1990s, the Tatmadaw severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds.|$|E
25|$|All {{citizens}} of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen {{at the age of}} sixteen by the child's parents. If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians. Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other <b>groups</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years.|$|E
