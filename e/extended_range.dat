5|$|On December7, 2009, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued {{their first}} <b>extended</b> <b>range</b> {{outlook for the}} 2010 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, predicting 13.9 named storms, 7.4 hurricanes, 3.4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 135 units. The organization referenced two main factors, slower trade winds across the Caribbean and above-average ocean temperatures across the Atlantic, for an above-average season. Two days later, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their first <b>extended</b> <b>range</b> outlook, projecting 11 to 16 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, 3 to 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 100 to 162 units. The organization stated that although a strong El Niño event was ongoing at the release of their forecast, a continuation of a warm El Niño-Southern Oscillation was unlikely to persist through the hurricane season. On January27, 2010, The Weather Company (formerly WSI) called for the year to feature 13 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{delivery}} of the F-28s and 737s, all planes were named after Norwegian kings. The last three F-27s were also given such names. During the 1970s, Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s, supplementing the four F-28s. The third delivered, LN-SUA, had a cargo door on the side, making it ideal for cargo flights. The three planes delivered in 1979 had <b>extended</b> <b>range</b> tanks making direct flights to the Canary Islands possible. In 1979, the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet, considering larger aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Il-6 was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} high-speed replacement for the Il-4. But after the initial design was completed in August 1942, the VVS requested that the bomber have <b>extended</b> <b>range</b> instead of high speed. The original M-71 radial engines were therefore replaced by Charomskiy ACh-30 diesel engines with low fuel consumption which promised to give the Il-6 the required range, especially when operated at moderate weights. The revised design was completed in December 1942 and production of the prototype was initiated. The first flight of the Il-6 was made in Irkutsk on 7 August 1943 with lower-powered ACh-30B engines substituted for the unavailable ACh-30BF engines.|$|E

Also known as the DM-15X2, the EX was renamed Spartan in January 1967. The Spartan never flew {{as part of the}} original Nike-X, and its first flight in March 1968 took place under Sentinel.|$|E

5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an <b>extended</b> <b>range</b> {{forecast}} for the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral sea surface temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was very accurate in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E

40|$|This effort {{investigates the}} extent to which {{moveable}} canards can <b>extend</b> the <b>range</b> of indirect fire munitions using both projectile body and canard lift. Implications on terminal velocity and time of flight using this mechanism to <b>extend</b> <b>range</b> are examined for various canard configurations. Performance predictions are conducted using a six-degree-of-freedom simulation model that has previously been validated against range data. The projectile dynamic equations are formed in the body frame and aerodynamic loads from the body and canards are Mach number and angle of attack dependent. The projectile body aerodynamic moments include unsteady aerodynamic damping. The focus of the study is directed toward low cost competent munitions that <b>extend</b> <b>range</b> and as such a simple flight control system is considered which utilizes only timer, roll rate, and roll attitude inputs...|$|R
