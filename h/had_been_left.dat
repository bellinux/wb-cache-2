5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|A Sinclair Executive {{purchased}} by a Russian diplomat exploded in his breast pocket, allegedly {{leading to an}} official Soviet investigation. It was found that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> on by accident, leading to a current drain on the batteries that overheated them until they burst.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E

5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through Dunkirk, {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1836, Independence {{returned}} to New Orleans for refitting and while there Commodore Hawkins died of smallpox. When Independence sailed from New Orleans on 10 April 1837, with Texas minister to the United States, William H. Wharton aboard, she was skippered by her new Captain, George W. Wheelwright, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> without a command after the forced sale of Liberty in May 1836.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division, in their first {{offensive}} of the war, stood {{only a few miles}} short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line. The 3rd Regiment <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} was reformed at Baggush {{from those}} who had escaped capture at Sidi Rezegh (about 300-odd) and other personnel who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> out of battle, along with replacements from New Zealand. The battalion's second-in-command, Major C.D.A. George, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> behind at Baggush when the New Zealanders moved into Libya, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became its commander. The battalion was stationed at Baggush until late January 1942 before being moved to Maadi. Shortly afterwards it was called into Cairo for four days to increase the Allied presence there and counter potential unrest amongst the civilian population of the city. Once tensions decreased it returned to Maadi, and resumed training and this included practice in amphibious operations.|$|E

5|$|The stolen Ford Escort {{belonged to}} a man from Portadown, who {{according}} to Captain Fred Holroyd, had links {{with one of the}} UVF bombers and the driver of the bomb car which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> to explode in Parnell Street, Dublin on 17 May 1974. He {{was also one of the}} prime suspects in the sectarian killing of Dorothy Traynor on 1 April 1975 in Portadown.|$|E
5|$|Air America {{helicopters}} {{continued to}} make rooftop pickups until after nightfall by which time navigation became increasingly difficult. Helicopters overflew the designated LZs to check no Americans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> behind and then the last helicopters (many low on fuel) headed out to TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E

5|$|Although {{supplies}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there {{were not}} the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} 25th Battalion's {{campaign}} in Greece amounted to nearly 30 killed and wounded with 150 personnel captured and made prisoners of war. The {{majority of the}} captured personnel were from the battalion's reinforcement company, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> in Athens when the 6th Brigade moved up to the Aliakmon Line, {{as well as a}} truckload of infantrymen that had been misdirected to Kalamata during the retreat. One soldier managed to escape and eventually make his way to Turkey by sea, an act for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>left</b> vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E
