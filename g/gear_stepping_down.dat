40|$|An {{automatic}} bone traction {{device for}} correction bone deformities is disclosed. The automatic bone traction device can include a main body, a step motor, {{a series of}} transmission gears, and connectors. In one implementation, the step motor operates at a speed of eight steps per second, and the series of transmission <b>gears</b> can <b>step</b> <b>down</b> {{the motion of the}} step motor to two revolutions per day. The generated driving torque is then transmitted to a bone distractor, such as a commercially available intermittent distractor. The automatic bone traction device is capable of activating the bone distractor continuously at a rate of two revolutions per day. Advantageously, a flexible shaft is used to connect between the transmission gear assembly and the bone distractor. The flexible shaft allows {{the main body of the}} bone traction device to be mounted away from the bone distractor at a convenient location for the user. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|An optimal line {{pressure}} control {{algorithm was proposed}} for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each <b>gear</b> <b>step,</b> the required {{line pressure}} was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required line pressure of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal line pressure map at each <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the line pressure map, an optimal line pressure was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed line pressure control algorithm, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the <b>gear</b> <b>step</b> became higher, the optimal line pressure control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing line pressure control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|R
