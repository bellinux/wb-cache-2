40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> is a noninvasive, objective, {{reproducible}} and painless {{method for}} measuring blood flow in tissue microcirculation. This method {{is based on}} the Doppler effect, the change in frequency of light reflecting from blood cells in motion. Light from helium-neon laser through optical fibers and probes is directed {{to the surface of the}} tissue in which the flow is measured. Light portion is reflected from the cells in motion and changes the frequency while another portion is reflected from the static tissue maintaining the same frequency as the initial light. The total reflected light, with changed and original frequency, reaches photo detector in the same probe where the emitter is and it is transformed into electrical impulse. In the orofacial region the <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method</b> is used to examine blood flow in the mandible, teeth pulp and masticator muscles. A significant drawback of the <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method</b> is its sensitivity to the ambient conditions during measuring and the fact that blood flow is measured in all blood vessels of examined microregion. Therefore, the circulation of isolated individual blood vessels can not be monitored. <b>Laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method</b> can give reliable indicators of blood flow in mouth tissue and method is acceptable for the patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective:To assess {{feasibility}} {{of a new}} technique for simultaneous measurement of digital artery and skin perfusion pressure at the same digit using the <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method</b> and to measure the pressure gradient between the two vessel compartments in controls and patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Design:A pressure cuff wrapped around {{the basis of the}} toe and connected to a Statham transducer is covered by a special plastic capsule. A hole at the distal end of the capsule permits positioning of a <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> probe at the pulp. A second <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> probe is placed on the skin beneath the pressure cuff. Reappearance of pulsatile flux during cuff pressure release detected by the two <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> probes indicated digital artery pressure and skin perfusion pressure on the corresponding pressure curve. Results in patients with intermittent claudication were compared to results of a group of normal controls. Setting:University Hospital, Zürich, Switzerland. Materials:Eleven healthy volunteers and 14 patients with intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial occlusive disease were studied. Chief outcome measures:Digital artery pressure (DAP), skin perfusion pressure (SPP) and pressure gradient between DAP and SPP. Main results:Significantly lower mean DAP (95. 8 ± 23. 2 mmHg vs. 49. 8 ± 20. 4 mmHg; p < 0. 01) and mean SPP (81. 4 ± 18. 8 mmHg vs. 38. 4 ± 21. 7 mmHg; p < 0. 01) were observed in the patients. Mean pressure gradients and ratios between DAP and SPP did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was a linear correlation between DAP and SPP (r = 0. 82, p < 0. 01). Conclusion:The <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method</b> provides the possibility to measure digital artery and skin perfusion pressure simultaneously at the same digit in an easy and non-invasive way.

Emails with a link to the survey were sent to physicians from the European Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR), the EULAR Study Group on Microcirculation in Rheumatic Diseases (SG_MC/RD) and members of the pediatric rheumatology Email board. The main descriptive analysis related to physicians looking after adult patients, with some analysis also of opinions from paediatric rheumatologists. 106 'adult physicians' responded (a response rate of 25. 8 %), of whom 68. 9 % were European, and 81. 1 % practising for more than 10  years. Nineteen paediatricians responded. The most widely available technique was NVC (72. 7 %). Nailfold capillaroscopy was most frequently performed by the physician him/herself, using different types of equipment relating to availability. Most rheumatologists reported high levels of appropriateness for NVC in both clinical and research settings for global assessment and differential diagnosis of Rp. Other techniques were less used. Of all the different techniques, nailfold capillaroscopy was the one most used in both clinical and research settings by adult physicians, the majority of whom use NVC in their everyday practice. The low proportion of clinicians using other techniques suggests that these are currently mainly research tools, available only in specialist centres. status: publishe...|$|R

The actuator slot width was 0. 36 mm, with a drive frequency proposed near the theoretical natural frequency of the actuator. The working fluid was water at room temperature.

However, in those patients for whom RP is secondary to an underlying disease (eg, systemic sclerosis or atherosclerosis), progression to digital ulceration or critical ischemia can occur. Therefore, the key question for the clinician is “Why does this patient have RP?” Vascular diagnostics {{play a key role}} in answering this. In this review, we firstly discuss the different vascular investigations relevant to clinical practice: nail fold capillaroscopy (including the different methodologies for examining the nail fold capillaries, and the role of capillaroscopy in helping to differentiate between primary and systemic sclerosis-related RP), thermography (available in specialist centers), and evaluation of large vessel disease (for example, due to atherosclerosis). We then discuss research tools, mainly <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>methods,</b> including <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> imaging and <b>laser</b> speckle contrast imaging. These are commercially available as complete imaging systems and are (relatively) easy to use. The main current goal in vascular imaging research is to validate these novel state-of-the-art techniques as outcome measures of digital vascular disease, and then apply them in early and later phase studies of new treatment approaches, thus facilitating drug development programs.

To {{investigate}} digital microvascular {{responses to}} topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) {{in patients with}} primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP), limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (LCSSc) and healthy control subjects, using <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> imaging. <b>Methods.</b> Ten patients with PRP, 13 with LCSSc and 10 control subjects were studied. Baseline skin microvascular blood flow of the dorsum of the index, middle and ring fingers of the non-dominant hand was measured using scanning <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> imaging. After the initial image, 2 % GTN ointment was rubbed on the dorsum of one finger for 1 min; placebo ointment was rubbed on the dorsum of a second finger for 1 min, and the third finger remained untreated. Further <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> scanning of these three fingers was conducted immediately, 10 and 20 min after ointment application. Results. There was increased blood flow response to placebo compared with no treatment (P< 0. 001) and to GTN compared with placebo (P= 0. 004). The change in blood flow over time differed significantly between placebo and GTN (P< 0. 001), but not between placebo and no ointment application: blood flow increased with GTN and decreased with placebo/no treatment at 10 and 20 min. There were no differences in initial baseline blood flow or response between the subject groups. Conclusions. An exogenous supply of nitric oxide by topical GTN ointment causes local endothelial-independent vasodilatory responses in PRP, LCSSc patients and control subjects.

The latter can be subdivided in <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>methods</b> systems based on high speed CMOS cameras, and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) technologies using slow imaging arrays, mostly CCD-based. In scanning beam systems, a collimated laser beam scans the tissue with diffusely back reflected light being captured with a single detector.

Endothelial dysfunction and loss of arterial elasticity are early markers of hypertension and atherosclerosis. We studied the prevalence of these markers in 44 healthy, prepubertal (age 961. 3 years) children, 22 with LBW for age. Methods and Results—Endothelial function in skin was tested with the local application of acetylcholine (inducing endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and nitroglycerin (endothelium-independent vasodilation), and local perfusion changes were measured with the <b>laser</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>method.</b> The elastic properties of the abdominal aorta and common carotid artery were measured with an ultrasonic vessel-wall tracking system. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was lower in children with LBW (88633 perfusion units [PU]) than in normal-birthweight controls (133634 PU, P, 0. 001). There was no difference in aortic or carotid elasticity between the 2 groups, but a negative correlation was found between birthweight and stiffness of the carotid artery wall (r 520. 45, P, 0. 01). Endothelium-independent vasodilation and blood pressure were similar in the 2 groups. Conclusions—Schoolchildren with a history of LBW show impaired endothelial function and a trend toward increased carotid stiffness.

The changes in blood flow and oxygenation of tumors wereinduced by transient changes of the parameters of anesthesia and by injection of a vasoactive drug hydralazine. Results. Both optical methods usedin the study successfully detected the induced changes in blood flow and pO 2. The measurements of pO 2 were well correlated with measurements of microcirculatory blood perfusion. In the majority of pO 2 measurements, we observed an unexpected behavior of the signal during the stabilization processimmediately after the insertion of the probe into tumor. This behaviourof the pO 2 signal was most probably caused by local tissue damage induced by the insertion of the probe. Conclusion. The novel luminescence-based optical oximetry can reliably detect local pO 2 changes in tumors as a function of time but some aspects of prolonged pO 2 measurement by this method require further investigation...|$|R
