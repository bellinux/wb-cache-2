25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they <b>do</b> <b>look</b> the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy {{has also}} been subject to criticism. GamePros Ashley Schoeller said that graphically, [...] "the games <b>do</b> <b>look</b> a bit dated" [...] and complained that the HUD was [...] "out of aspect" [...] to fit the widescreen. Official Nintendo Magazines Fred Dutton said that some aspects of Prime and Echoes had aged, saying the {{backtracking}} [...] "feels like more of a chore than it did seven years ago," [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "not until [...] enters its final third that things really start to pick up". GamesRadar considered the achievements too expensive, and that the similarity between the three games gives [...] "an inescapable sense of déjà vu". Edge noted that the control scheme was not very innovative, and that Echoes and Corruption [...] "favoured graphical flourishes over design innovation". While Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the game, the [...] "second opinion" [...] reviewer, Adam Biessener, considered the collection [...] "subpar", saying it lacked innovation, and that the Wii control scheme, particularly aiming and panning, [...] "is inferior in every way to the traditional scheme from the GameCube titles".|$|E
500|$|The Duff family {{formed a}} {{janitorial}} services company, Windy City Maintenance Inc., {{one month after}} Daley's inauguration. Bruce DuMont, president of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, said that Daley recommended that Dumont's wife Kathy Osterman, then director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, award city contracts to Duff family companies. Daley denied steering contracts to the Duffs, {{and said he would}} [...] "look into" [...] the allegations, while stopping short of promising to do so, saying [...] "I don't promise. That's the wrong word to use. You know... promising, promising. We <b>do</b> <b>look</b> into it, yes." [...] In September 2003 a federal investigation led to indictments of Patricia Green Duff, her sons John M. Duff and James Duff, and others on charges they won nearly $100 million in city contracts through the city's set-aside program by misrepresenting their companies as women- and minority-owned. John M. Duff pleaded guilty to 33 counts of racketeering, fraud and other charges on January 10, 2004. A 1978 state law designed by Illinois Democrats gave the Mayor the power to appoint to fill vacancies in the City Council rather than holding special elections, and by 2002 {{more than a third of}} the Council's 50 aldermen were initially appointed by Daley. The [...] Council became even more of a rubber stamp than in Richard J. Daley's terms. In the 18 months from January 12, 2000 to June 6, 2001, only 13 votes in the [...] Council were divided, less than one a month. 32 aldermen supported the mayor 90-100% of the time and another 14 80-89% of the time.|$|E

'Why, {{only see}} how easy {{they might have}} been stronger, sir,' said Mark, 'if it wasn't for the envy of that {{uncommon}} fortun of mine, which is always after me, and tripping me up.

60|$|Maryanne {{the while}} looked on, as ladies of yore <b>did</b> <b>look</b> on when knights {{slaughtered}} {{each other for}} their smiles. And perhaps of yore the hearts of those who <b>did</b> <b>look</b> on were as cold and callous as was hers. For one moment of enthusiasm she had thought she loved, but now again she was indifferent. It might be settled as well this way as any other.|$|R
2500|$|However, the {{inclusion}} of cel-shaded 3D character models was met with mixed reactions. While it was generally agreed that the models <b>do</b> <b>look</b> good, many were critical of their [...] "wooden" [...] animations. Cameron Woolsey of GameSpot said the 3D character models [...] "blend effortlessly into the gorgeous" [...] backdrops, but was critical of the [...] "distracting," [...] "stiff and somewhat primitive animations." [...] Edge felt that the [...] "strange, plastic-looking" [...] 3D character models and their [...] "awkward, robotic animations" [...] are a [...] ""jarring" [...] that looks [...] "entirely out of place". But both Snædal and Thew viewed this as a minor issue, and others were far less critical of the animations, particularly Osborn, who was [...] "really impressed" [...] with the [...] "much-improved animations and sly 2.5D effects" [...] and the [...] "fluid and effortless" [...] character movements. Pete Davison of USgamer said that the [...] "gorgeous," [...] "high-res" [...] backgrounds coupled with the [...] "high detail" [...] 3D models make for a [...] "good-looking game", despite [...] "some animations [...] a little wooden at times." [...] Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy complimented {{the inclusion}} of 3D models set against 2D backgrounds, which he said that, [...] "despite looking dated in some respects", felt [...] "like a natural evolution" [...] for Broken Sword.|$|E
