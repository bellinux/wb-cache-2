25|$|In overdose, <b>iprindole</b> is {{much less}} toxic than most other TCAs and is {{considered}} relatively benign. For instance, between 1974 and 1985, only two deaths associated with <b>iprindole</b> were recorded in the United Kingdom, whereas 278 were reported for imipramine, although {{it should be noted}} that imipramine is used far more often than <b>iprindole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only {{one study}} {{appears to have}} {{evaluated}} the pharmacokinetics of <b>iprindole.</b> A single oral dose of 60mg <b>iprindole</b> to healthy volunteers {{has been found to}} achieve mean peak plasma concentrations of 67.1ng/mL (236nmol/L) after 2 to 4hours. The mean terminal half-life of <b>iprindole</b> was 52.5hours, which is notably much longer than that of other TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine. Following chronic treatment with 90mg/day <b>iprindole</b> for 3weeks, plasma concentrations of the drug ranged between 18 and 77ng/mL (63–271nmol/L). Theoretical steady-state concentrations should be reached by 99% within 15 to 20days of treatment.|$|E

25|$|The binding affinities of <b>iprindole</b> {{for various}} {{biological}} targets {{are presented in}} the table to the right. It is presumed {{to act as an}} inhibitor or antagonist/inverse agonist of all sites. Considering the range of its therapeutic concentrations (e.g., 63–271nM at 90mg/day), only the actions of <b>iprindole</b> on the 5-HT2 and histamine receptors might be anticipated to be of possible clinical significance. However, it is unknown whether these actions are in fact responsible for the antidepressant effects of <b>iprindole.</b> The plasma protein binding of <b>iprindole</b> and hence its free percentage and potentially bioactive concentrations {{do not seem to be}} known.|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} these interactions, caution should be used when {{combining}} <b>iprindole</b> with other drugs. As an example, when administered with amphetamine or methamphetamine, <b>iprindole</b> increases their brain concentrations and prolongs their terminal half-lives by 2- to 3-fold, strongly augmenting both their physiological effects and neurotoxicity in the process.|$|E

25|$|Anticholinergic {{side effects}} such as dry mouth and {{constipation}} are either greatly reduced {{in comparison to}} imipramine and most other TCAs or fully lacking with <b>iprindole.</b> However, it still has significant antihistamine effects and therefore can produce sedation, though this is diminished relative to other TCAs similarly. <b>Iprindole</b> also lacks significant alpha-blocking properties, and hence does not pose a risk of orthostatic hypotension.|$|E

25|$|<b>Iprindole</b> is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a cyclooctaindole (that is, an indole nucleus {{joined with}} a cyclooctyl ring), and possesses three rings fused {{together with a}} side chain attached in its chemical structure.

40|$|<b>Iprindole</b> {{in vitro}} {{displaces}} mianserin from specific recognition sites (IC 50 3 microM). Daily doses (5 mg/kg i. p.) of <b>iprindole</b> repeated for 3 weeks attenuate the norepinephrine stimulation of adenylate cyclase studied in brain slices. Whereas the attenuation of noradrenergic receptor function elicited by imipramine can be antagonized by lesions of serotonergic axons, the inhibition of norepinephrine-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase elicited by <b>iprindole</b> or mianserin is not inhibited by serotonin axon lesions. <b>Iprindole</b> given daily repeatedly reduces the maximal number of binding sites of [3 H]mianserin and [3 H]ketanserin; both actions are unchanged by lesions of central serotonergic axons...|$|E
40|$|Type II {{alveolar}} {{epithelial cells}} in long-term culture typically lose {{the ability to}} synthesize surfactant together {{with a loss of}} the characteristic lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells. <b>Iprindole,</b> a cationic amphiphilic drug, induces lamellar body formation in cultured L- 2 cells, a cell line derived from rat Type II cells, but devoid of lamellar bodies. With concentrations of 10 (- 7) - 10 (- 5) M <b>iprindole,</b> which approximate therapeutic plasma concentrations in human subjects, the drug induced the formation of lamellar bodies within 8 hours of incubation. This effect on cell morphology was rapidly lost after withdrawal of the drug. At concentrations of <b>iprindole</b> which induced lamellar body formation, there was a significant increase in phospholipid content of the L- 2 cells as well as an increase in disaturated phosphatidylcholine, an important constituent of surfactant. These studies suggest that the use of drugs such as <b>iprindole</b> may represent a novel approach in the augmentation of phospholipid (and possibly surfactant) content of Type II cells in the lung...|$|E
40|$|An assay {{procedure}} utilizing electron-capture {{gas chromatography}} {{was developed for}} simultaneous analysis of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. This method was applied to brain and liver samples from rats which had been injected with fenfluramine with or without pretreatment with <b>iprindole.</b> The tissues from rats treated with fenfluramine showed extensive formation of norfenfluramine, consistent with findings reported previously in the literature. Pretreatment with <b>iprindole</b> led {{to an increase in}} brain and liver levels of fenfluramine, and, unexpectedly, to a marked decrease in levels of norfenfluramine in these tissues. These findings suggest that <b>iprindole</b> blocks N-deethylation and that it may be a useful tool with which to study the effects of fenfluramine in the absence of norfenfluramine. The results also emphasize the importance of considering drug-drug interactions in future research on fenfluramine...|$|E
