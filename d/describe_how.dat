The Acid2 test page will be {{displayed}} correctly in any application {{that follows the}} World Wide Web Consortium and Internet Engineering Task Force specifications for these technologies.

5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|In verse 11, {{the text}} makes a {{reference}} to a fragment from section 1.14 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, to metaphorically <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> to gain this knowledge. Making his own soul as the lower fire stick and Om the upper fire stick, states the Kaivalya Upanishad, one must rub these together, light up the fire of knowledge, and burn the ties to ignorance.|$|E

30|$|Outline. Section 2 first <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> the {{framework}} {{is used to}} model user-centred privacy-aware systems that leverage pseudonymization, before <b>describing</b> <b>how</b> potential pseudonymization risks are identified in Section 3. Section 4 reports how {{the framework}} carries out data utility analysis. Section 5 <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> the framework is applied following privacy-by-design practice, and the framework is evaluated in Section 6. Section 7 describes related work, and Section 8 provides a conclusion and indicates areas of future work.|$|R
50|$|This section, from pages 130-136, <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> a spellcaster {{character}} can recharge an item which uses charges, such as wands, rods, staves, and some rings. It <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> {{this process is}} completed and what is required, both for wizard items and priest items.|$|R
5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E
5|$|The film {{breaks into}} three {{distinct}} acts. In the first, the former Scientologists <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> they joined Scientology; {{the second act}} recounts the history of Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard; and in the final act, the film airs allegations of the abuse of church members and misconduct by its leadership, particularly David Miscavige, {{who is accused of}} intimidating, beating, imprisoning, and exploiting subordinates. The film depicts the role played by celebrity members, such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise, through video clips contrasting their statements with the experiences of former Scientologists.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} used to <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> handlebars that extend {{far behind the}} steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
50|$|Stress {{relaxation}} <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> polymers relieve stress {{under constant}} strain. Because they are viscoelastic, polymers {{behave in a}} nonlinear, non-Hookean fashion. This nonlinearity is described by both stress relaxation and a phenomenon known as creep, which <b>describes</b> <b>how</b> polymers strain under constant stress.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set {{contains}} zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

25|$|Polymer {{properties}} are broadly divided into several classes {{based on the}} scale at which the property is defined as well as upon its physical basis. The most basic property of a polymer is the identity of its constituent monomers. A second set of properties, known as microstructure, essentially describe the arrangement of these monomers within the polymer at the scale of a single chain. These basic structural properties {{play a major role}} in determining bulk physical properties of the polymer, which <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> the polymer behaves as a continuous macroscopic material. Chemical properties, at the nano-scale, <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> the chains interact through various physical forces. At the macro-scale, they <b>describe</b> <b>how</b> the bulk polymer interacts with other chemicals and solvents.|$|E
