25|$|In 1893, {{the money}} earned by these {{electric}} trams exceeded {{the cost to}} maintain the trams. Furthermore, the electric trams were used whenever the horse-drawn or steam-powered trams had difficulty. Nevertheless, the system's horse-drawn trams were in use until 1895, and the last steam-powered cars ran until 1904, when a diesel <b>electric</b> <b>station,</b> on the so-called Dachnaya (Dachna) to Puschya-Vodytsia line was built. This station had lasted until the 1930s. These trams required very little power, which caused any electric trams, which used the line, to move so slowly that the passengers could get {{on and off the}} tram, while the tram remained in motion.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility for {{the drain}} and pumping station then {{passed to the}} Anglian Water Authority, and they built a new {{electric}} pumping station, which was commissioned in 1983. The diesel station was retained, but its condition deteriorated, {{so that by the}} early 1990s, only one of the engines was operational. At the request of Lindsey Marsh IDB, a small team of volunteers began to restore the station and the engines in 1994, and the site is opened for visitors three times a year. The restoration has enabled the station to be used twice in 2000 and once in 2004, when power failure prevented the <b>electric</b> <b>station</b> from operating, and during the floods of 2007, both engines ran to assist the electric pumps. The team of volunteers was led by Dennis Quincey, and following his death in 2002, the Drainage Board renamed it Quinceys Pumping Station.|$|E
