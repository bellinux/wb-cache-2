50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the domestic capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> a concept of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) has been introduced, officials stated.Two MoUs have already been signed by the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand for setting up Greenfield steel plants with initial capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) each, to be later enhanced to 6 MTPA. More than Rs 70,000 crore will be invested for setting up of these steel plants.Notably, India was the only country among the major steel producing {{nations of the world}} which recorded a positive trend in <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> and consumption in 2015, officials stated.The first 11 months of 2015, <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> vis a vis 2014, India showed a growth of 2.8%, and world <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> registered decrease of 2.8%.

40|$|The {{publication}} {{presents the}} prognostic modeling of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in Poland by 2020. Based {{on the general}} framework predicting, {{an attempt was made}} to adjust the model to empirical data, which were related to the size of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> in Poland. Two prognostic approaches were used. The first approach included determination of prognoses for total <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> on the basis of empirical data for the 1990 - 2014 period. The second approach used empirical data for the volume of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> according to production technologies for the 2000 - 2015 period. Prognoses until 2020 were determined in both cases. Thus obtained prognoses were related to changes observed on the global steel market...|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the last}} century, growth of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> was in the {{developing}} countries such as China, Brazil and India, as well as newly developed South Korea. <b>Steel</b> <b>production</b> and consumption grew steadily in China in the initial years but later it picked up momentum and the closing years of the century saw it racing ahead of the rest of the world. China produced 220.1 million tonnes in 2003, 272.2 million tonnes in 2004 and 349.4 million tons in 2005. That is much above the production in 2005 of Japan at 112.5 million tons, the US at 93.9 million tons and Russia at 66.15 million tons.

50|$|In 1994, ARBED {{decided to}} change its type of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> for long {{products}} (such as sheet piling) at its sites in Luxembourg. The <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> moved from produced from iron ore with blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces using recycled steel.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 {{the company}} had a <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> {{capacity}} of ~2million tonnes pa. In 1980 it merged with Thy-Marcinelle et Providence.

30|$|The global <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> {{is growing}} rapidly, from 1, 248 Mt in 2006 to 1, 490 Mt in 2011 —an {{increase}} of about 16  % {{in a short}} span of 5  years [114]. <b>Steel</b> <b>production</b> is an energy intensive process and thus consumes huge amount of fossil fuels. On world average, each ton of <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> emits 2.2 ton of CO 2.

50|$|Communist party {{dictator}} Mao Zedong disdained {{the cities}} and put his faith in the Chinese peasantry for a Great Leap Forward. Mao saw <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> {{as the key to}} overnight economic modernization, promising that within 15 years China's <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> would surpass that of Britain. In 1958 he decided that <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> would double within the year, using backyard steel furnaces run by inexperienced peasants. The plan was a fiasco, as the small amounts of steel produced were of very poor quality, and the diversion of resources out of agriculture produced a massive famine in 1959-61 that killed millions.|$|R
50|$|US {{production}} {{of iron and}} steel peaked in 1973, when the US industry produced a combined total of 229 million metric tons of iron and steel. But US iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> dropped drastically during the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s. From a combined iron and <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> of 203 million tons in 1979, US output fell almost in half, to 107 million tons in 1982. Some steel companies declared bankruptcy, and many permanently closed steelmaking plants.
