5000|$|Mexican Coke is bottled {{in a thick}} 355 ml or 500 ml glass bottle, {{which some}} have {{described}} {{in contrast to the}} American Coke plastic bottles as being [...] "more elegant, with a pleasingly nostalgic shape". Instead of having a vinyl label wrapped around plastic, an <b>enamel</b> <b>label</b> is painted directly on the glass bottle. Most exporters of Mexican Coke affix a paper sticker containing the nutrition facts label, ingredients, and bottler and/or exporter's contact information, to meet U.S. food labelling requirements.|$|E
60|$|The square {{has altered}} little, {{even in these}} days of enterprise, when Tillyloss has become Newton Bank. and the Craft Head Croft Terrace, with <b>enamelled</b> <b>labels</b> on them for the {{guidance}} of slow people, who forget their address and have to run {{to the end of the}} street and look up every time they write a letter. The stones on which the butter-wives sat have disappeared, and with them the clay walls and the outside stairs. Gone, too, is the stair of the town-house, from the top of which the drummer roared the gossip of the week on Sabbaths to country folk, to the scandal of all who knew that the proper thing on that day is to keep your blinds down; but the townhouse itself, round and red, still makes exit to the south troublesome. Wherever streets meet the square there is a house in the centre of them, and thus the heart of Thrums is a box, in which the stranger finds himself suddenly, wondering at first how he is to get out, and presently how he got in.|$|R
40|$|Vital {{labelling}} of hard tissues {{was used}} to examine the periodicity of features of dental <b>enamel</b> microstructure. Fluorescent <b>labels</b> were administered pre- and postnatally to developing macaques (Macaca nemestrina), which were identified histologically in dentine and related to accentuated lines in enamel, allowing for counts of features within known-period intervals. This study demonstrates that cross-striations represent a daily rhythm in enamel secretion, and suggests that intradian lines are the result of a similar 12 -h rhythm. Retzius lines were found to have a regular periodicity within individual dentitions, and laminations appear to represent a daily rhythm that also shows 12 -h subdivisions. The inclusion of intradian lines and laminations represents the first empirical evidence for their periodicities in primates; these features frequently complicate precise measurements of secretion rate and Retzius line periodicity, which are necessary for determination of crown formation time. The biological basis of incremental feature formation is not completely understood; long-period features may result from interactions between short-period rhythms, although this does not explain the known range of Retzius line periodicities within humans or among primates. Studies of the genetic, neurological and hormonal basis of incremental feature for-mation are needed to provide more insight into their physiological and structural basis. Key word...|$|R
40|$|International audienceImmunoblot {{analyses}} and ultrastructural immunogold {{studies have been}} conducted on annexins in the secretory ameloblasts and odontoblasts of the rat incisor. Annexins I and II were seen in the soluble and particulate fractions of the enamel-related portion but not in the dentin-related portion. These proteins were visualized in the cytosol, near to the plasma membrane of Tomes' processes and in secretory vesicles in the ameloblasts. The forming <b>enamel</b> was also <b>labeled.</b> Annexins III, VI an V were detected in both the soluble and particulate fractions of the enamel-and dentin-related portions. Annexin IV was mainly localized in the proximal and distal areas of the secretory ameloblasts and virtually absent from in the supranuclear area. Annexin V was mainly detected in the cytosol of the cells {{and to a lesser extent}} near the plasma membrane. Annexin VI was mainly detected in the particulate fraction of enamel- and dentin-related portions. It was seen in the mitochondria and in the subplasmalemmal undercoat. All these proteins may play a role in exocytosis and endocytosis. They are implied in the regulation of cell calcium, but not in the transfer of calcium through the cells in the direction of the forming enamel and dentin, except annexins I and II since they are both present in the secretory vesicles and in the forming enamel...|$|R
