25|$|The {{causes of}} IBS are not clear. Theories include {{combinations}} of gut–brain axis problems, gut motility disorders, pain sensitivity, infections including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, neurotransmitters, genetic factors, and food sensitivity. Onset may {{be triggered by}} an <b>intestinal</b> <b>infection,</b> or stressful life event. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms {{in the absence of}} worrisome features. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption, and colon cancer.|$|E

The data for my analysis are taken from Ecuadorian census and vital statistics materials from 1982 and 1990.
