5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value <b>his</b> <b>opinion.</b> But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona is very strong. If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
5|$|However, Yousafzai {{does have}} some support in Pakistani media; Farman Nawaz argues that Yousafzai would have gained more fame in Pakistan if she belonged to the {{province}} of Punjab. <b>His</b> <b>opinion</b> was not given importance by the mainstream media of Pakistan but his views in this regard were published by Daily Outlook Afghanistan.|$|E

5000|$|The work {{appears to}} be a genuine and earnest debate of <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> about human nature, rather than satirical. Twain held views {{similar to that of the}} Old Man prior to writing [...] "What is Man?". However, he seems to have varied in <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> of human freedom.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, the Zimbabwe {{government}} banned media from {{following the}} England cricket team {{tour of the}} country. Agnew's reaction was combative, appearing on BBC Breakfast and giving <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> that the ban presented the ECB {{with a chance to}} withdraw from the controversial tour and that they should take the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Jim Henson {{said his}} ideas did not mesh well {{with those of}} the writers. He said his {{creative}} team did not form a bond with the writing staff, which, in <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> embraced a darkly irritating form of comedy.|$|E
5|$|Local tradition, first {{written down}} by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot. The {{site and the}} Great Hall are extensive, and the writer Geoffrey Ashe argued {{in an article in}} the journal Speculum that it was the base for the Arthur of history. <b>His</b> <b>opinion</b> has not been widely {{accepted}} by students of the period.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting that the book was well {{researched}} and provided a solid history of the show. Critics felt that the final chapters, in which Ortved gives <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> of {{the current state of}} the show, were out of place and did not fit in with the rest {{of the book}}.|$|E
5|$|While Biden's presidential {{campaign}} {{did not last}} beyond the first caucuses, he created a favorable impression during the debates and increased his stature among Washington politicos. In particular, Barack Obama changed <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> of Biden, liking how he had handled himself at campaign stops and appreciating his appeal to working class voters.|$|E
5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> when he saw that the director Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E

5000|$|In 1898, Bradlaugh's {{daughter}} Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner wrote {{a pamphlet}} {{in answer to}} the question that was often addressed to her: whether her father [...] "changed <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> and became a Christian" [...] before he died. Bonner laid out all the evidence and concluded that her father gave no indication that <b>his</b> <b>opinions</b> had changed in the [...] "smallest" [...] way.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. <b>His</b> <b>opinion</b> was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
5|$|During post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> of {{the scene}} when {{hundreds}} of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might be ruined if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and {{was impressed with the}} result. C. E. Biggs was the film's audio engineer.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> of the Austrian military.|$|E

5|$|Goldilocks's fate {{varies in}} the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows {{to be a good}} child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{deserved}} a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul's church-yard.|$|E
5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In <b>his</b> <b>opinion,</b> members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted {{that there is no}} restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> found invalid the repealed Tenure of Office Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed {{that even if the}} lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in <b>his</b> <b>opinion</b> still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E
