50|$|An {{electron}} withdrawing group (EWG) {{will have}} the opposite effect on nucleophilicity as an EDG, as it removes electron density from a π system, making the π system more electrophilic. When attached to a benzene molecule an electron withdrawing group makes electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions slower and more complex, and EWGs are often <b>called</b> <b>deactivating</b> groups. Depending on their relative strengths, EWGs also determine the positions (relative to themselves) on the benzene ring where substitutions must take place; this property is therefore important in processes of organic synthesis.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This figure {{shows that}} exotoxins are {{secreted}} by bacterial cells, Clostridium botulinum for example, and are toxic to somatic cells. Somatic cells have antibodies {{on the cell}} surface to target exotoxins and bind to them, preventing the invasion into the somatic cells. The binding of the exotoxin and antibody forms an antigen-antibody interaction and the exotoxins are targeted for destruction by the immune system. If this interaction does not happen, the exotoxins bind to the exotoxin receptors {{that are on the}} cell surface and causes death of the host cell by inhibiting protein synthesis. This figure also shows that the application of heat or chemicals to exotoxins can result in the deactivation of exotoxins. The <b>deactivated</b> exotoxins are <b>called</b> toxoids and they are not harmful to somatic cells.|$|R
25|$|In catalysis, the {{reaction}} does not proceed directly, but through reaction {{with a third}} substance known as catalyst. Although the catalyst takes part in {{the reaction}}, it is returned to its original state {{by the end of}} the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that <b>deactivate</b> catalysts are <b>called</b> catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.|$|R

Megan was treated wonderfully but Joe {{was forced to}} stay with monkey in a closet. Joe and Monkey {{inadvertently}} wake up a <b>deactivated</b> robot <b>called</b> Kvetchbot who throws {{him out of the}} closet. Kvetchbot gets upgraded but when he finds out the Soviet Union had fallen and it is the year 2007 he attacks Kleptobot. The two proceed to do battle through the city which culminates with Kvetchbot downgrading Kleptobot from being Y2K compatible so his generator would burst. Kleptobot reveals his reactor to be cold-fusion and nobley flies into space so the city would live his last action is to grab hold of the Fox news satellite and then detonates. On Earth Kvetchbot threatens to kill Joe and Monkey saying that when they're dead he'll start on Megan.Monkey tells Kvetchbot that won't happen and promptly tears Kvetchbot to pieces. Joe reveals in a sort of epilogue that they stayed with the robots who couldn't put Kvetchbot back together [...] "Either that or they didn't try I wasn't really paying attention" [...] as he put it. Although go comics reveals in upcoming comics that Joe is sitting right across from Kleptobot while telling the story to a waitress. When asked what happens, Kleptobot jokes he's robot Jesus before revealing whenever he fights he uploads his data onto a server so if he's destroyed he can be re-installed onto new hardware. When asked if this cheapens death Kleptobot responds [...] "Yes, it does" [...] but he amends [...] "However, I did promise to take Megan out for a banana split. And death is nothing when compared to the power of ice cream" [...] revealing that once more Kleptobot is truly a hero.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the role of nucleoside analog activating and deactivating enzymes in nucleoside analog metabolism and resistance development. Nucleoside analogs are anti-cancer drogs and are often used to treat different leukemias, attributably to presence of high levels of nucleoside analog activating enzymes in hematopoietic cells. More recently some of the newer analogs have been used  successfully to treat solid tumors as well. We have used human leukemic cell lines, and isolated cells from patients with leukemia, to investigate the nucleoside analog activating enzymes deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and some of the <b>deactivating</b> enzymes <b>called</b> 5 'nucleotidases (5 '-NTs). We have measured mRNA expressions and enzymatic activities and correlated them with the cytotoxic response to nuc 1 eoside analogs and changes in cell cycle progression. We optimized and evaluated a siRNA-transfection method and decreased the activities of dCK and dGK in two different cell lines in order {{to find out more about}} their respective contribution to activation of these drogs. An expression microarray analysis of a nucleoside analog resistant cell line was also performed in order to clarify which genes are involved in development of resistance. We found that expressions and activities of dCK and dGK were not correlated. The enzyme activities of activating and deactivating enzymes changed during cell cycle progression, giving actively proliferating cells a more favorable enzymatic profile with regard to nucleoside analog cytotoxicity. The activities of dCK and dGK could be reduced transiently in leukemic and solid tumor cell lines, thereby confer either resistance or increased sensitivity to nucleoside analogs to variable degrees. Expression microarray analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the transfection method and the specificity of siRNA. We concluded that cells tolerated the transfection weIl without major effects on gene expression, and considered the siRNA used to be specific to its target. An expression microarray experiment on a nucleoside analog-induced resistant cell line revealed a hypomethylating capacity of the drog and induction of fetal hemoglobin and a multidrog resistance efflux pump as a result of the hypomethylation. This pump should not be affected by nucleoside analoges since they are not a substrate of it, and upregulation of the pump unfortunately renders the cells highly cross-resistant to different types of drogs. Our preliminary data supports our theory that it may be upregulated in order to help excrete hemoglobin that otherwise would be toxic to the cells...|$|R
