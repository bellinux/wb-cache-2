60|$|A noble indignation {{rises in}} the minds of your popular leaders, on hearing the magic-lantern in their show of finance {{compared}} to the fraudulent exhibitions of Mr. Law. They cannot bear to hear the sands of his Mississippi compared with the rock of the Church, on which they build their system. Pray let them suppress this glorious spirit, until they show to the world what piece of solid ground there is for their assignats, which they have not preoccupied by other charges. They do injustice to that great mother fraud, to compare it with their degenerate imitation. It is not true that Law built solely on a speculation concerning the Mississippi. He added the East India trade; he added the African trade; he added the farms of all the farmed revenue of France. All these together unquestionably could not support the structure which the public enthusiasm, not he, chose to build upon these bases. But these were, <b>however,</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparison,</b> generous delusions. They supposed, and they aimed at, an increase of the commerce of France. They opened to it the whole range of the two hemispheres. They did not think of feeding France from its own substance. A grand imagination found in this flight of commerce something to captivate. It was wherewithal to dazzle the eye of an eagle. It was not made to entice the smell of a mole, nuzzling and burying himself in his mother earth, as yours is. Men were not then quite shrunk from their natural dimensions by a degrading and sordid philosophy, and fitted for low and vulgar deceptions. Above all, remember, that, in imposing on the imagination, the then managers of the system made a compliment to the freedom of men. In their fraud there was no mixture of force. This was reserved to our time, to quench the little glimmerings of reason which might break in upon the solid darkness of this enlightened age.|$|E

40|$|Aim: In {{this study}} we compare the {{incidence}} of rarity within lineages between three floras: Australia, North America and New Zealand. Methods: We used published data for absolute numbers of species and for numbers of rare species to ask three questions: 1. Do families have similar proportions of rare species in different floras? 2. Can proportions of rare species within families be interpreted with reference to biogeographic history of particular floras? and 3. Is the proportion of rare species consistent between families and genera within each flora? Results: Within families in each flora, genera usually had similar proportions of rare species; indicating processes determining rarity are in general not operating differentially within families. <b>However,</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparisons</b> within-family between floras, approximately 62 % of comparisons showed {{significant differences in the}} proportion of rare species. Main conclusions: These results imply that there are no general rules whereby the particular traits a family possesses are conducive to rarity wherever they occur. Rather, such attributes must exert influence conditionally, in conjunction with the biogeographical and competitive setting where speciation and extinction or persistence has occurred. 8 page(s...|$|R

Nevertheless, the only genomic sequence that has been completed is the attenuated HSV- 2 HG 52 laboratory strain. In this study we defined the genomic sequence of the HSV- 2 SD 90 e low passage clinical isolate and a plaque-purified derivative, SD 90 - 3 P. We found minimal sequence differences between SD 90 e and SD 90 - 3 P. <b>However,</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparisons</b> with the HSV- 2 HG 52 reference genome sequence, the SD 90 e genome ORFs contained numerous point mutations, 13 insertions/deletions (indels), and 9 short compensatory frameshifts.

In predicting alcohol dependence, outcome expectancies were found to mediate self-efficacy and the same pattern was found for both males and females. This suggests that male and female drinkers may become more similar as they progress along the drinking continuum from risky drinking to dependent drinking. <b>However,</b> <b>in</b> women, <b>in</b> <b>comparison</b> to men, a greater array of expectancies and self-efficacy scales were found to predict heavy drinking, as measured by quantity and frequency.
