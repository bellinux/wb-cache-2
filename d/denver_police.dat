5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the <b>Denver</b> <b>Police</b> Department.

50|$|Unlike the {{original}} series, {{which took place}} in San Francisco, California, the reunion was set and filmed in Denver, Colorado, with the justification that the character Ed Brown had become the city's deputy chief of <b>police.</b> (<b>Denver</b> was also where most of Burr's Perry Mason TV movies were produced.)

5000|$|There {{was also}} a {{delightful}} building for the influential newspaper, Cervi's Journal (now the Denver Business Journal), located on Delaware Street near the Denver City and County Building. Sternberg was quite nervous when Cervi, a liberal, outspoken, temperamental newspaperman first approached him. [...] "Why me?" [...] he asked. [...] "You know so many architects in Denver. I don't want to be crucified in your paper if I make a mistake - and I do make mistakes!" [...] Cervi reassured him, [...] "Gene, you and I will get along just fine. I {{want you to be}} my architect." [...] The collaboration worked well and Cervi was delighted with his new facility. Unfortunately, after Cervi died and the paper was taken over by his daughter, the City of Denver decided it needed the land. The Cervi office was among the buildings razed to make room for <b>Denver's</b> new <b>police</b> building.|$|R
2500|$|Familial DNA {{database}} searching {{was first}} used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor {{of the murder of}} Lynette White in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born {{at the time of the}} murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004 to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him. DNA found on the brick matched that found at the scene of a car theft earlier in the day, but there were no good matches on the national DNA database. A wider search found a partial match to an individual; on being questioned, this man revealed he had a brother, Craig Harman, who lived very close to the original crime scene. Harman voluntarily submitted a DNA sample, and confessed when it matched the sample from the brick. Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States, where states determine how and when to conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search with a subsequent conviction in the United States was conducted in Denver, Colorado, in 2008, using software developed under the leadership of Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey and <b>Denver</b> <b>Police</b> Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge. California was the first state to implement a policy for familial searching under then Attorney General, now Governor, Jerry Brown. In his role as consultant to the Familial Search Working Group of the California Department of Justice, former Alameda County Prosecutor Rock Harmon is widely considered to have been the catalyst in the adoption of familial search technology in California. The technique was used to catch the Los Angeles serial killer known as the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] in 2010. It wasn't a witness or informant that tipped off law enforcement to the identity of the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] serial killer, who had eluded police for more than two decades, but DNA from the suspect's own son. The suspect's son was arrested and convicted in a felony weapons charge and swabbed for DNA last year. When his DNA was entered into the database of convicted felons, detectives were alerted to a partial match to evidence found at the [...] "Grim Sleeper" [...] crime scenes. David Franklin Jr., also known as the Grim Sleeper, was charged with ten counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. More recently, familial DNA, led to the arrest of 21-year-old Elvis Garcia on charges of sexual assault and false imprisonment of a woman in Santa Cruz in 2008. In March 2011 Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell announced that Virginia would begin using familial DNA searches. Other states are expected to follow.|$|E
50|$|On {{the same}} day President Obama was {{scheduled}} to give his address at the <b>Denver</b> <b>Police</b> Academy, where <b>Denver</b> <b>police</b> officers would be in uniform as a backdrop, sixteen Colorado sheriffs planned {{a news conference in}} a nearby park. Some <b>Denver</b> <b>police</b> officers wanted to attend the Colorado Sheriff's event, in uniform, but their request was denied by Chief White.|$|E
50|$|Chief White {{directed}} temporary alterations to the <b>Denver</b> <b>Police</b> Academy, {{and the use}} of uniformed <b>Denver</b> <b>police</b> officers, {{to accommodate}} White House efforts to enhance an address by President Obama to support gun control (attracting national attention because of pushback from some police officers).|$|E
50|$|In Colorado, Orr {{was elected}} county judge and served for three years. He moved to Denver, Colorado, {{and engaged in}} the {{practice}} of his profession and also in the real estate business. In 1882, President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as one of three commissioners to implement a treaty between the United States and the Ute tribe. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for Colorado's at-large Congressional seat in 1884. He {{served as president of the}} <b>Denver</b> Fire and <b>Police</b> Board in 1893 and 1894.|$|R
5000|$|Arrests during WNBR {{events are}} rare. Two male riders were arrested during the 2005 WNBR in North Conway, New Hampshire, {{and charged with}} [...] "indecent {{exposure}} and lewdness". The two riders agreed to having the charges reduced to [...] "disorderly conduct" [...] and paid a $300 fine, {{a major portion of}} which was paid for by the WNBR Legal Defense Fund. Six male riders were charged with public indecency during the 2005 WNBR Chicago ride and later prosecuted with sentences ranging from fines and non-expungeable conviction to three months of court supervision. In 2007 during the first World Naked Bike ride in <b>Denver,</b> Colorado <b>police</b> surrounded the bike riders and wrote several people tickets. [...] During the WNBR held on June 12, 2010, two males were arrested by campus police at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. [...] Two riders were arrested in New York City in 2014 for [...] "lewdness and indecent exposure".|$|R
50|$|The modern wheel clamp, {{originally}} {{known as}} the auto immobiliser, was invented in 1944 and patented in 1958 by Frank Marugg. Marugg was a pattern maker, a violinist with the Denver Symphony Orchestra, {{and a friend of}} many <b>Denver</b> politicians and <b>police</b> department officials. The police department needed a solution to a growing parking enforcement problem. The city used to tow all ticketed cars to the pound, where they were often vandalised. Those who were ticketed sued the city for the damage and the police had to itemise everything in the cars. Dan Stills, a policeman, thought an immobiliser would avoid the expensive towing problem and approached Marugg with an idea on how to immobilise a vehicle.|$|R

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the <b>Denver,</b> Colorado <b>police</b> force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Loveland {{city and}} Larimer County police {{participated in the}} standoff. The crisis caught the Loveland city police, who had not before {{experienced}} a crisis of this magnitude, in a change of administration in which the previous chief had resigned and the new chief was to arrive the next day. The force was under command of an acting police chief and was criticized for not calling in the <b>Denver,</b> Colorado <b>police</b> force and SWAT team which was 60 miles and likely several hours away. At about 9 pm, a Loveland police sharpshooter positioned on a bluff overlooking the restaurant was given permission to fire and wounded the gunman with a shot {{through the front door}} window. The shot was fired from a rifle, striking the suspect in the left torso. The wounded gunman fell back but then fired three fatal shots into waitress Sally Mills, age 40, and killed himself with a single shot to the head. Concurrent with the gunfire, hostage Fenton Crookshank, who was at the Lions Club meeting when the crisis began, crawled through a bathroom window facing the front of the restaurant and was killed by five shots from the Colt [...]45 automatic pistol of a Loveland police sergeant.|$|R
40|$|Black {{power in}} the late 1960 s was once blamed for {{the fall of the}} civil rights movement. The more militant and {{abrasive}} black power approach was mistaken for the alternative civil rights movement, contradictory to the progressive approach of nonviolent marches in the South. However, recent scholarship contextualizing black power and the Black Panthers in particular, restructured this paradigm. This move toward a more inclusive approach to studying black resistance across the country steered The Movement out of the Memphis to Montgomery narrative, and instead provides a more textured understanding of black radicalism as a vital aspect of civil rights history. The Denver Black Panther Party was instrumental in Denver 2 ̆ 7 s civil rights movement, particularly from 1968 - 1971. By embracing the national party‘s ten-point program, the BPP radicalized Denver‘s civil rights climate. <b>Denver‘s</b> BPP experienced <b>police</b> brutality, vandalism, and mistreatment, all of which were encouraged by the city‘s mayor, police chief, and elected officials, in a city which claimed that blacks 2 ̆ 2 just didn‘t have it that bad. 2 ̆ 2 Denver‘s black politicians were agents of change, no doubt, but their mere representation in the state house and city council, and the school board did not inherently guarantee protection from racism. Denver‘s blacks were involved in changing their city, through local politics, national conversations about school desegregation, and in the Panther‘s case, through active resistance...|$|R
