The aircraft, an Airbus A319-115, operated {{on a flight}} from Paro to Bangkok via Guwahati. While descending to Guwahati over the Garo Hills, hail stones damaged and punctured the nose cone of the aircraft. A safe landing was made at Guwahati. No Fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging <b>hail,</b> <b>storm</b> surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E
5|$|Two Australian CH-47Ds were {{destroyed}} in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in Zabul Province, {{resulting in the}} death of an Army unmanned aerial vehicle pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes, and that the aircrew had not been adequately trained to prevent such incidents. A15-103 was written off following a hard landing in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012, resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe <b>hail</b> <b>storm.</b> Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012.|$|E

At mid-day, Masséna began making headway on the Austrian right. In the afternoon, the brigades of Generals-major Adolf Brabeck and Anton Schübirz von Chobinin arrived on the field. Soon the Austrians forced back Masséna. Provera also appeared and drove back Augereau. The arrival of nightfall allowed the French to pull safely back into Verona.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{had held}} the Ashes since 1958–59 and Cowdrey was keen to return them to England, but he was {{frustrated}} by the damp summer. There was no excuse for the First Test at Old Trafford where Australia made 357 and England fell from 86/0 to 165 all out to the part-time off-spin of Bob Cowper (4/48) and lost by 159 runs, though Basil D'Oliveira made 87 not out in the second innings. The Second Test was the 200th {{between the two countries}} and Colin Milburn hammered 83 and Cowdrey 45 in England's 351/7 while Australia were hustled out for 78 after a freak <b>hail</b> <b>storm</b> whitened the ground. 15 hours were lost to the weather and after following on Australia salvaged a draw with 127/4.|$|E

40|$|In 2016, hail was {{responsible}} for 3. 5 billion and 23 million dollars in damage to property and crops, respectively, making it the second costliest weather phenomenon in the United States. In an effort to improve hail-prediction techniques and reduce the societal impacts associated with <b>hail</b> <b>storms,</b> we propose a deep learning technique that leverages radar imagery for automatic detection of <b>hail</b> <b>storms.</b> The technique is applied to radar imagery from 2011 to 2016 for the contiguous United States and achieved a precision of 0. 848. <b>Hail</b> <b>storms</b> are primarily detected through the visual interpretation of radar imagery (Mrozet al., 2017). With radars providing data every two minutes, the detection of <b>hail</b> <b>storms</b> has become a big data task. As a result, scientists have turned to neural networks that employ computer vision to identify hail-bearing storms (Marzbanet al., 2001).

500|$|Performances usually {{began at}} 3pm to take {{advantage}} of the daylight: the main floor for the audience, the pit, had no roof in order to let in the light. A glazed dome was built over the opening, but according to one of Pepys' diary entries, the dome was not entirely effective at keeping out the elements: he and his wife were forced to leave the theatre to take refuge from a <b>hail</b> <b>storm.</b> Green baize cloth covered the benches in the pit and served to decorate the boxes, additionally ornamented with gold-tooled leather, and even the stage itself. The backless green benches in the pit were in a semicircular arrangement facing the stage, according to a May 1663 letter from one Monsieur de Maonconys: [...] "All benches of the pit, where people of rank also sit, are shaped in a semi-circle, each row higher than the next." [...] The three galleries formed a semicircle around the floor seats; both the first and second galleries were divided up into boxes.|$|E
500|$|Ale {{primarily}} destroy {{crops in}} fields, vineyards, and orchards by leading <b>hail</b> <b>storm</b> clouds overhead, usually {{during the first}} half of the summer when grain crops ripen. Ale are also believed to “drink the crops”, or seize the crops of a village and transport them to another place in their huge ears, thereby making some villages poor, and others rich. This was held as the reason why the Aleksandrovac region in central Serbia was so fruitful: it was where ale transported their loot. The people of Kopaonik mountain believed the local ala defended the crops of the area from other ale. If hail destroyed the crops, it was thought that an ala from another area had defeated the local ala and “drunk the crops”. Ale can also spread themselves over fields and thwart the ripening of the crops, or worse, consume the field's fertility, and drink the milk from sheep, especially when it thunders. Ale also possess great strength; when a storm uprooted trees, the people believed that an ala had done it. This resulted in a saying for a very strong man: jak kao ala, [...] "as strong as an ala".|$|E

500|$|In {{the region}} of Dragačevo, western Serbia, people told of the vilovit men, who would {{disappear}} {{at the sight of}} hail clouds, reappearing bloody and with torn clothes after the storm was over. Asked where they had been to, they would only answer that they had gone to fight against those who led the hail clouds toward their village. The adjective vilovit means [...] "having a vilas properties" [...] or [...] "vila-like". The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies, female anthropomorphic spirits of woods, mountains, clouds, and waters, who had magical powers. In {{the region of}} Tamnava, north-western Central Serbia, the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks. An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić, published in 1875. In the story, men from Krnić and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a <b>hail</b> <b>storm</b> brought by alien vetrenjaks. They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them, their bodies turning black and blue from the blows. The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain, away from their fields.|$|E
2500|$|Cats were {{believed}} to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, {{in the hope that}} {{they would be able to}} use their influence to protect their husbands at sea. It was believed to be lucky if a cat approached a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it only came halfway, and then retreated. [...] Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included, if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a <b>hail</b> <b>storm</b> was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.|$|E
2500|$|After his victory, Blake {{advanced}} on Zaragoza with 20,000 men {{divided into}} three divisions. He advanced down the Huerva River with one division on the right bank and two divisions on the left bank. Leaving Laval and a 2,000-man brigade to observe the Spanish right bank division, Suchet confronted Blake in the Battle of María on 15 June 1809. The French general deployed Musnier on his right and General of Brigade Pierre-Joseph Habert's 1st Division brigade on his left. Suchet expected some troops to arrive {{later in the day}} and planned to stall for time. Blake struck at Musnier's division but the 114th Line beat back the attack with help from a Polish lancer regiment. Suchet ordered a counterattack but the combat was halted by a <b>hail</b> <b>storm.</b> [...] At length, the French reinforcements arrived and Suchet launched Habert and Pierre Watier's cavalry at Blake's right wing. The Spanish line crumbled, but Blake was able to withdraw in relatively good order, though he lost 16 of his 25 guns. The French and Poles lost 700 or 800 casualties out of 10,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 12 guns. The Spanish suffered losses of 1,000 killed, 3,000 to 4,000 wounded, and hundreds captured out of 14,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horsemen. Musnier's division was the same as at Zaragoza, with the addition of one battalion of the 2nd Reserve Legion.|$|E
