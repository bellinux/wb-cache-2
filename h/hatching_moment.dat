40|$|Ontogeny process {{comprises}} the embryo development {{from the moment}} of fecundation, through embryonic development phase, until hatching or later phases. The study of embryogenesis is an important tool for growth study of the species within their natural environment. The present work observed and registered the main stages of Betta splendens embryonic development, {{one of the most promising}} ornamental species mostly because of the increasing commercial interest, to describe the initial ontogeny and thus contribute for a better understanding about the biology of this species. It was possible to observe that as the embryonic time passes, there was a decrease in yolk height and then at its length, mainly at the final phases of embryonic period. Newly hatched larvae did not use feed from exogenous source. The embryo of B. splendens presented embryonic development phases similar to the observed for other teleostei species. The 1 st cell division/blastula was observed at 1 HPF (Hour-Post-Fertilization) until the 7. 5 HPF; the gastrula period was observed starting at 8. 5 HPF until 14. 5 HPF; the organogenesis period was from 15 HPF until the <b>hatching</b> <b>moment,</b> at 38 HPF...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{evaluated}} effects of hatch moment and immediate feed and water access within a 24 -h hatch window on chicken growth and development. Five hundred four male chickens {{obtained from a}} 49 -wk-old Ross 308 breeder flock were assigned to 72 cages based on <b>hatching</b> <b>moment</b> (early, midterm, or late; selected during periods of 475 to 481, 483 to 487, and 489 to 493 h after onset of incubation). At {{the end of each}} hatching period, chickens were moved to the grow-out facility and one-half of the chickens received feed and water ad libitum immediately. Remaining chickens received feed and water from 504 h after onset of incubation (d 0). Body weight gain and feed intake for each cage were recorded at d 0, 1, 4, 7, 11, and 18. Chickens were sampled at d 4 and 18 for organ and carcass development. Early hatchers had lower BW at placement compared with midterm and late hatchers but compensated for this afterward, resulting in a higher BW at d 4 (112. 8, 107. 1, and 103. 3 g, respectively). From d 0 to 18, early hatchers tended to have higher BW gain than both other groups. Relative breast meat yield at d 18, expressed as percentage of carcass weight, was higher for early (30. 4 %) than midterm (28. 5 %) and late hatchers (27. 8 %). Up to d 7, direct feed access resulted in higher BW gain (6. 1 %) and feed intake (4. 2 %) compared with delayed feed access. No effect of moment of feed access on feed efficiency or organ weights was found. Direct feed access resulted in a higher weight:length ratio of the jejunum (12. 5 %) and ileum (7. 5 %) at d 4 compared with delayed feed access. These results suggest that early hatchers have a different developmental and growth pattern than midterm or late hatchers within a 24 -h hatch window. A mild delay in feed access after hatch affects growth and development during the first week after hatch...|$|E
60|$|The English disappeared, {{as if by}} magic. Some leaped {{upon the}} ridge-ropes, others sought the {{protection}} of the guns, and many went through the <b>hatches.</b> At that <b>moment</b> Ludlow made his most desperate effort. Aided by the gunner, he applied matches to the two swivels, which had been placed in readiness for a last resort. The deck was enveloped in smoke, and, when the vapor lifted, the forward part of the ship was as clear as if man had never trod it. All who had not fallen, had vanished.|$|R

'How long {{he stood}} stock-still by the <b>hatch</b> expecting every <b>moment</b> {{to feel the}} ship dip under his feet and the rush of water take him at the back and toss him like a chip, I cannot say. Not very long--two minutes perhaps. A couple of men he {{could not make out}} began to {{converse}} drowsily, and also, he could not tell where, he detected a curious noise of shuffling feet. Above these faint sounds there was that awful stillness preceding a catastrophe, that trying silence of the moment before the crash; then it came into his head that perhaps he would have time to rush along and cut all the lanyards of the gripes, so that the boats would float as the ship went down.|$|R
50|$|After a {{long time}} Kadru {{gave birth to a}} {{thousand}} eggs and Vinata to two eggs. The eggs were carefully incubated in containers with hot water or in jars which were kept warm. After a lapse of five hundred years, the eggs laid by Kadru hatched and her sons came to life; of these thousand nāga sons, the most prominent ones were Shesha, Vasuki and Takshaka. All the serpents born in this world are the descendants of these thousand sons. Vinata became jealous as her eggs had not <b>hatched.</b> In a <b>moment</b> of haste, she broke open one of the eggs, revealing a half-formed son. This son was enraged by his physical form and cursed his mother for her hasty act, saying she would be a slave to Kadru for five hundred years till the son from her second egg was born. He became a charioteer and herald for the sun god and the creator of the red sky at dawn, and was therefore named Aruṇa. Eventually, after five hundred years, Vinata's second son Garuda was born {{in the form of a}} huge bird with immense power. As soon as he was born he flew away with grace, seeking food.|$|R
50|$|Although Rankin is {{accustomed}} to leading, he defers leadership to Blink {{on the grounds that}} she is from a reality that is more removed from the 'mainstream' universe than the other Exiles, and will therefore {{be able to make the}} judgement calls that their missions require without being potentially compromised by her connection to the counterparts of their opponents. Rankin also begins a romantic relationship with Blink. The Exiles' missions grow increasingly dangerous, and Mimic is forced to kill more than once to safeguard entire realities. Many of those he slays are alternate versions of heroes he knows as allies in his home reality and their deaths weigh heavily on his mind, Mimic coming to increasingly resent how so many versions of the people he knows have been corrupted by their power. After an encounter with the sorcery of a vampiric Union Jack, Mimic is trapped for four years on an Earth overrun by the Brood. On this Earth, he is implanted with a Brood egg. He returns to his teammates incubating an egg only held at bay by his acquired healing factor. The Brood egg <b>hatches</b> during a <b>moment</b> of weakness, and the possessed Rankin is forced to attack his teammates, killing Mariko Yashida (Sunfire). Devastated by his actions, Mimic swears never to kill again. During an encounter with Weapon X, Mimic is forced to mimic Deadpool's healing factor in order to survive. Unfortunately for Mimic, the healing factor also comes with Deadpool's unique skin condition; the very sight of which instigated a conflict with Blink concerning their relationship. After swearing never to kill again, his subsequent hesitation to do so, further compounded by an illusion in which Blink claims to no longer love him, allows the villain Proteus to possess him when the Exiles visit the House of M version of the regular Marvel Universe. After Proteus leaves Mimic's burnt husk of a corpse, the Exiles put his body into stasis. Blink later takes him back to his home reality for burial.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{physiological}} responses of early- versus late-hatching chicks to early posthatch conditions in broiler practice. We investigated effects of hatching time on perinatal broiler physiology in 2 hatching systems, differing in conditions: a conventional hatcher, where chicks are deprived of feed and water between <b>hatching</b> and the <b>moment</b> of chick pulling (d E 21. 5), and a patio system, in which the hatching and brooding phase are combined, and chicks have immediate posthatch feed and water access. Climate conditions in patio also differ with about 3 °C lower temperature and 20 % lower RH compared with conventional hatchers. At E 18, fertile eggs were transferred to either a hatcher or the patio {{until the end of}} incubation. From each system, 50 newly hatched chicks were collected at 3 hatching times: at 468 h (early), 483 h (midterm), and 498 h (late) of incubation, of which 25 chicks were decapitated for analyses of physiological parameters. The other 25 chicks were returned to the hatching system for analyses after 515 h of incubation (E 21. 5). At hatch, weights of the heart, lungs, stomach, and intestine increased with hatching time, concurrent with a decrease in residual yolk weight, regardless of hatching system, and indicating that later hatching chicks are more matured. Weights of the heart, liver, stomach, and intestines were lower in hatcher than in patio chicks. Between hatch and E 21. 5, residual yolk weight decreased, whereas organ weights increased in both fasted hatcher and fed patio chicks, but at a higher rate in the latter. At E 21. 5, plasma glucose and triiodothyronine had increased with time after hatch in patio chicks, whereas levels were similar among hatching times and lower in hatcher chicks. Early feed and water access seems to enable early hatching chicks to compensate for their apparent disadvantage in development at hatching, whereas chicks subjected to fasting show metabolic adaptations to preserve nutrients. Chick physiology at chick pulling time was shown to vary with time after hatching and posthatch conditions, especially feed acces...|$|R
