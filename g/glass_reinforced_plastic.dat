25|$|To {{keep the}} rally car {{competitive}} into the 1980s an evolution version, the Chevette HSR, was developed which was successful {{for several more}} years. The modified cars featured <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> (fibreglass) front and rear wings, spoiler, bonnet and tailgate (giving the HSR the nickname 'Plastic Fantastic'), revised suspension (particularly at the rear, where extra suspension links were fitted), and other minor changes. Group 4 evolution required a production run of 50 cars incorporating the new modifications; these were made by rebuilding unsold HSs and by modifying customers' vehicles. However, the merger of the Vauxhall and Opel marketing departments resulted in Dealer Team Vauxhall and Dealer Opel Team (DOT) joining to form GM Dealer Sport (GMDS); with the Chevette soon to be obsolete, Opel were able to force the cancellation of the HSR rally programme in favour of the Manta 400.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E

About 63 % {{of the amount}} supplied (4. 6 mmol styrene) was taken up in the body. The arterial blood concentration of styrene reached a relatively stable level of 15 mumol/l {{at the end of}} exposure which was about 70 % of the blood concentration in a group of volunteers with no previous exposure to solvents. The apparent blood clearance was significantly higher in the occupationally exposed subjects 2. 01 /h X kg compared with 1. 51 /h X kg. Contrary to the relatively stable level of styrene at the end of exposure the concentration of non-conjugated styrene glycol increased throughout the exposure and reached about 3 mumol/l in both groups. Like styrene, the non-conjugated styrene glycol seemed to be eliminated faster from the occupationally exposed workers.

40|$|Abstract. Advanced {{researches}} {{on concrete}} are directed toward investigating {{the behavior of}} reinforced concrete structures in severe conditions such as those promoted by impact loads. Some particular structures (protective shelters, nuclear reactor containment, offshore structures, military structures, chemical or Energy production plant) may be subjected to loading at very high rate of stress or strain caused by impact of missiles or flying objects, also by vehicle collisions or impulses due to explosions and earthquakes. Resistance to impact loads is guaranteed by using cementitious materials having both high strength and ductility. In order to improve ductility cementitious mortars with <b>Glass</b> <b>Reinforced</b> <b>Plastics</b> (GRP) replacing partially the natural sand were manufactured. Moreover, <b>glass</b> fiber (GF) <b>reinforced</b> mortars were produced to enhance toughness. For this scope two types of glass fibers were used different in length and diameter.
