40|$|The Spanish {{railway network}} is very complex, with two {{different}} track gauges: the broad classic Iberian track gauge and {{the so called}} <b>international</b> <b>gauge,</b> the latter used in the extensive high speed network. All new lines have been built with double track and top technologies. But there are controversial opinions among experts regarding how the network should grow. We had developed what we called isochrone circle graphs and a geometric index for radial railway networks improvement estimation, {{that can be very}} useful for decision taking regarding the improvement of railway lines. The corresponding paper was illustrated with a sketch constructed with a Dynamic Geometry System that used sliders to change the input parameters (timing to each peripheral destination and population of these destinations). Although very comfortable to use, altering the number of peripheral destinations considered required to construct a complete new sketch. To avoid this problem and {{in order to be able}} to perform symbolic computations and solve equations with the data obtained, we have begun from scratch and have designed and implemented a complete new package in the computer algebra system CAS Maple that takes as input the lists of destinations, timings and populations and builds the corresponding isochrone circle graphs and performs all the corresponding calculations. An important advantage of working in symbolic mode (i. e., of introducing parameters in the computations) is the possibility to work with unknowns (that represent network improvement goals) and consequently obtain the time improvement required in a line in order to ful ll a network speci c improvement goal...|$|E
40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} making the ports to change continuously in order to adapt their strategies to new challenges to attract more traffic to their ports and {{to take into account}} seriously the impact of the industry to the environment. The Port of Barcelona (PoB) is not an exception for this and needs to detect its main weaknesses and strengths in order to improve its position. Nowadays, PoB is very far from some of its competitors despite being located near Africa and being one of the European closest port to Asia. Accordingly, it is needed to strengthen its positive factors and to improve the ones that are worst. For this reason, PoB needs a change of strategy focusing on its main market (China) and trying to catch traffic mostly from ports located in Africa (because its proximity) or United Arab Emirates (constantly growing during last years). In addition, for becoming a model to follow about green transport, it is urgent to have an <b>international</b> <b>gauge</b> to connect the port to Europe, build the Mediterranean Corridor and apply some policies explained in the program of the European Commission Horizon 2020 about inland connections (awards to the cleanest carriers, for example). Applying those measures, PoB could become a more competitive port and respectful with the environment. The methodology used in the study consists on a deep explanation about the PoB, a comparison between the port and the Port of Rotterdam (because its leadership in Europe), Valencia Port (because it is the closest and the second most important port of Spain) and Port of Marseille (because its proximity going to the North and its competitiveness). After the comparison, Horizon 2020 is applied to Port of Barcelona for finalizing making proposals that connect both parts of the work (traffics and environment) ...|$|E
