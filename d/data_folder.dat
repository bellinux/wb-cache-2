50|$|The {{question}} may be raised {{as to why}} the entire roaming profile can not be accessed directly on the server, and no copying needs to be done at all.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{deal with the}} postpenitenciary care in {{ambulatory}} services for drug users. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore why clients seek and visit the institute, where my study took place, what services they used and which services did they miss there. Then I investigated reasons of their early abortion of these services. For these purposes, I chose a qualitative study - six case studies of clients who have used postpenitenciary services. My research took place in one organization - the ambulatory center for drug users. I was in contact with the clients throughout their whole attendance at the service. For the purpose of qualitative research I used <b>data</b> <b>folders</b> of the clients - records of consultations made with clients and all documents that were relevant for the study. All respondents were sent to the institution by workers of Probation and Mediation Service for Czech Republic. Four of the six clients completed the program properly. Two clients aborted the service earlier. Due to the quantity of the research sample we can not generalize these information, but we can say, that the provision of postpenitenciary care is very important to map the client's situation, individual access to his or her needs, and on this basis to select the appropriate interventions in work with theem, which I [...] ...|$|R

[...] "Portable" [...] maintains the default behavior of previous Android versions, treating {{the media as}} a secondary storage device for storage of user files, and the storage media can be removed or replaced without repercussions, but is subject to access restrictions by apps.

The objectives are to produce guidance on the issues and challenges in inclusive research, develop materials and case studies of practices that are breaking down barriers, making advances and challenging orthodoxies, and generate criteria for quality in inclusive research. Increasingly people with learning disabilities are calling for greater participation in research about them. Policy-makers similarly recognise this need. Thus people with learning disabilities steer research through involvement in advisory groups and commissioning, and shape and conduct research. Discussions of the potential and limitations of such inclusive research are based largely on individual reflections...|$|R

40|$|Distributors and {{promoters}} of organic food claim superior tastes {{for their products}} compared to the conventional alternative. This argument however is still subject to a hard debate and thus deserves more scientific evidence. Since repurchases are dependent on the overall liking of a product, and sensory experiences may have an important impact, knowledge about these dimensions is crucial for producers and marketers of organic food to offer products which meet consumer expectations. The main purpose of this project therefore is to develop the first Organic Sensory Information System (OSIS), a multilingual and centrally based <b>data</b> <b>folder</b> for data deposition along with an interface scheme {{that serves as a}} basis for data exchange to the benefit of the organic food market (organic associations, producer, processors, retailer, wholesaler as well as consumers). To this aim, a multidisciplinary and international research approach is necessary which comprises sensory and consumer research linked with standards requirements in different European countries (CH, DE, FR, IT, NL, PL). The extendable <b>data</b> <b>folder</b> will contain descriptions of sensory properties of specific products from six product categories as well as information about underlying production methods which explain the sensory differences between organic and conventional as well as consumer and expectations. The comprehensive sensory evaluations will also result in a preference mapping of sensory quality. The impact of EU legislation and standards of organic farming associations, which define production methods and ingredients, will also be elaborated for OSIS. Qualitative and quantitative consumer research is carried out to develop segment-specific marketing strategies based on OSIS for all stakeholders involved. Comprehensive dissemination and training activities, including the preparation of training materials for all stakeholder groups involved a well as for sale staff, will ensure the broad information of the organic food market...|$|E
