5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate the idea of <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> in a simpler way. So {{without a lot of}} fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of <b>doing</b> <b>things.</b> She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{defenders}} {{argue that}} a policy of rhetoric while <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> counter to the rhetoric was necessary {{in the sense of}} realpolitik and helped secure victory against the dangers of tyranny and totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|Some episodes do {{not involve}} rescues, but instead feature the Wonder Pets <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> with friends (such as Ollie, Floopy the Elephant, and the Visitor) and family (Linny's Granny, Tuck's cousin Buck, and Ming Ming's Aunt Eleanora). This may involve helping them as they {{normally}} would during rescues.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Pei Songzhi criticised Man Chong for his {{cruelty and}} said that he should not have tortured Yang Biao, who had a reputation for being virtuous.

25|$|Attention {{should be}} made to two {{important}} points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show - this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities - this means that people are actually <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{recovery}} he resumed his career to command the Cavalry Remount Camp in Maryland. Later he was a Special Inspector of Cavalry for the armies of the Potomac and the James where his insistence of <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> right contributed to {{a higher degree of}} quality and professionalism. During the post war period he served in Texas then retired as a full colonel on December 15, 1870.|$|E
50|$|This means that, {{instead of}} <b>doing</b> ecumenical <b>things,</b> Christians and churches {{should try to}} <b>do</b> <b>things</b> ecumenically, in particular, to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> {{together}} which are already {{a part of their}} normal life, i.e., to share a common life. Churches Together in England has created resources to help local groupings of churches to reflect on various aspects of sharing a common life.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter {{introduced}} the economic theory of creative destruction, {{to describe the}} way in which old ways of <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists (such as Paul Romer) view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital, and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws.|$|E
25|$|Nick Yee has {{surveyed}} {{more than}} 35,000 MMORPG players {{over the past}} several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games. Recent findings included that 15% of players become a guild-leader at one time or another, but most generally find the job tough and thankless; and that players spend a considerable amount of time (often a third of their total time investment) <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> that are external to gameplay but part of the metagame.|$|E
25|$|The stream-of-consciousness style {{being so}} {{prominent}} in this work, {{a summary of}} the plot based on physical action does not give a thorough understanding of the content of the work. In the novel, action occurring in the physical world (i.e.: characters <b>doing</b> <b>things,</b> such as talking, walking etc.) is far outweighed by material existing in the thought and memory of the protagonists. Some discretion must be made in a plot summary as to which of these thoughts and memories warrant detailing.|$|E

25|$|The fur trade benefited Indigenous {{people as}} well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Knives, pots and kettles, nets, {{firearms}} and hatchets made provided {{improvements in the}} general welfare. At the same time, while their everyday lives were made easier, some traditional ways of <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar.|$|E
25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do until we were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E
25|$|Lizzie also ends {{up going}} against her brother Charley's wishes, when {{she refuses to}} marry Bradley Headstone.

She unselfishly does what others expect of her, <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in Our Mutual Friend, and even that is debatable, since she only did it because Wrayburn appeared to be on his deathbed.|$|E

25|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} is a contemporary movement {{to establish the}} most effective algorithms of practice (ways of <b>doing</b> <b>things)</b> {{through the use of}} systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The movement is facilitated by modern global information science, which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The Cochrane Collaboration leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.|$|E
25|$|Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin {{is by far}} {{the wealthiest}} {{character}} in the play, but comes from the lowest social class. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but there is nothing in the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of <b>doing</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E
