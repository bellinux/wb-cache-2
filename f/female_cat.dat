25|$|Most modern Burmese are {{descendants}} of one <b>female</b> <b>cat</b> called Wong Mau, which was brought from Burma to America in 1930 and bred with American Siamese. From there, American and British breeders developed distinctly different Burmese breed standards, which is unusual among pedigreed domestic cats. Most modern cat registries do not formally recognize the two as separate breeds, but {{those that do}} refer to the British type as the European Burmese.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Joseph Cheesman Thompson {{imported}} Wong Mau, a brown <b>female</b> <b>cat,</b> into San Francisco in 1930. Dr Thompson {{considered the}} cat's build to be sufficiently {{different from the}} Siamese to still have potential as a fully separate breed. Wong Mau was bred with Tai Mau, a sealpoint Siamese, and then bred with her son to produce dark brown kittens that became {{the foundation of a}} new, distinctive strain of Burmese. In 1936, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) granted the breed formal recognition. However, due to continued extensive outcrossing with Siamese cats to increase the population, the original type was overwhelmed, and the CFA suspended breed recognition a decade later. Attempts by various American breeders to refine the unique Burmese standard persisted, however, and in 1954, the CFA lifted the suspension permanently. In 1958, the United Burmese Cat Fanciers (UBCF) compiled an American judging standard which has remained essentially unchanged since its adoption.|$|E
25|$|Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is {{a talking}} cat named for his {{signature}} pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive {{on the run}} from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a <b>female</b> <b>cat</b> named Kitty Softpaws interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his origin story and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.|$|E

40|$|It is {{not always}} {{possible}} to identify <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> that have undergone previous ovariohysterectomy based on physical examination alone. An easy, cost-effective method for screening <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> for reproductive status would be helpful for avoiding unnecessary exploratory laparotomies. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare diagnostic sensitivities of digital radiography, ultrasonography, and positive contrast vaginourethrography for determining reproductive status in <b>female</b> <b>cats.</b> Sixty-seven recently euthanized <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> of unknown medical history and reproductive status were randomly selected and included in the study. Digital abdominal radiography, digital abdominal radiography with compression, abdominal ultrasonography, and positive contrast vaginourethrography were performed in sequence by a board-certified veterinary radiologist and a second-year radiology resident. Immediately following diagnostic imaging procedures, necropsy was performed. Ultrasonography of the uterus had the highest sensitivity (86 %) for determining reproductive status of all the imaging modalities tested. The specificity was 88 %, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 96 % and 68 %, respectively. The calculated sensitivities and specificities of other modalities were as follows: digital radiographs (28 %, 100 %), digital compression radiographs (58 %, 100 %), and vaginourethrography (32 %, 100 %). Based on McNemar's test statistic, {{there was a significant}} difference in the sensitivity of ultrasound compared to digital radiographs (P ≤ 0. 05), compression radiographs (P ≤ 0. 05), and vaginourethrogram (P ≤ 0. 05). Findings from the current study indicated that ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic test for determining reproductive status in <b>female</b> <b>cats.</b> Although more readily available in private practice and shelters, digital radiography and vaginourethrography are not reliable predictors of reproductive status...|$|R

500|$|The {{hotel has}} a {{tradition}} of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was initially named [...] "Rusty." [...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so the cat was renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a <b>female</b> <b>cat,</b> she's named [...] "Matilda." [...] The current Algonquin cat, a Matilda, is a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. [...] Visitors can spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relation between the concentration of IGF-I and body weight in both male and <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> at young age. In this study, the plasma IGF-I concentrations and body weight in 4 female and 4 male cats at 5, 11, 17 and 21 months old were examined. No significant difference in the body weight between the female and male kittens (3. 1 +/- 0. 2 kg and 3. 2 +/- 0. 3 kg) at 5 months old was found, but at 11, 17 and 21 months old (5. 3 +/- 0. 2 kg, 5. 3 +/- 0. 4 kg, 5. 4 +/- 0. 2 kg) the male cats had significantly higher body weight (p< 0. 01) than the <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> (3. 1 +/- 0. 3 kg, 3. 3 +/- 0. 2 kg, 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 kg). The IGF- 1 concentration in the male cats (945 +/- 41 ng/ml) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than that in the <b>female</b> <b>cats</b> (520 +/- 39 ng/ml) at the age of 5 months.
