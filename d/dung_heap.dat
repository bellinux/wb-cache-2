2500|$|The Rabbis told in a Baraita {{an account}} in {{relation}} to [...] Once a Sadducee High Priest arranged the incense outside and then brought it inside the Holy of Holies. As he left the Holy, he was very glad. His father met {{him and told him}} that although they were Sadducees, they were afraid of the Pharisees. He replied that all his life he was aggrieved because of the words of [...] "For I appear in the cloud upon the Ark-cover." [...] (The Sadducees interpreted [...] as if it said: [...] "Let him not come into the holy place except with the cloud of incense, for only thus, with the cloud, am I to be seen on the Ark-cover.") The Sadducee wondered when the opportunity would come for him to fulfill the verse. He asked how, when such an opportunity came to his hand, he could not have fulfilled it. The Baraita reported that only a few days later he died and was thrown on the <b>dung</b> <b>heap</b> and worms came forth from his nose.

40|$|AbstractCulicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are the {{biological}} vectors {{of a range}} of internationally important arboviruses of livestock, including bluetongue virus (BTV) and the recently emerging Schmallenberg virus (SBV). Culicoides species in the subgenus Avaritia (in the UK: Culicoides obsoletus Meigen, Culicoides scoticus Downes & Kettle, Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer and Culicoides chiopterus Meigen) have been implicated in BTV transmission in northern Europe and to a varying degree utilise cattle dung as a larval development substrate. The collection of cattle <b>dung</b> into <b>heaps</b> on farms provides a localised source of Culicoides emergence in close proximity to livestock. This study assesses the impact of covering <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> prior to the onset of adult Culicoides activity with the aim of reducing recruitment to the local adult populations at four livestock farms in England. Light suction trap catches of adult Culicoides from these farms were compared with those from four untreated control farms from a wide geographic range across the UK. It was demonstrated that implementing control of emergence from <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> did not have a significant impact upon the local adult subgenus Avaritia abundance at the treated farm holdings and that the onset of Culicoides activity was similarly unaffected. Use of this method in isolation is unlikely to have an effect in reducing the risk of BTV and SBV transmission. The implications of these results for control of farm-associated Culicoides in Europe are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Most common {{earthworm}} species, such as Lumbricus terrestris, {{which can}} often be dug up in the garden, are eminently suitable for freshwater fishing. However, on a commercial scale they are not really candidates for worm farming for providing fishing bait. The greyish brown common earthworms are deep burrowing (anecic) and do not readily breed in the shallow worm farm bins. The red compost worms, such as the well known red wiggler or the European nightcrawler, are better candidates, as they are epigeic, or surface dwellers. This {{is the reason that}} red worms are more usually available commercially for bait worms. Their natural home is just below the surface in rotting leaves, <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> and other plant litter. They are called detritivourous because they eat detritus (waste material).|$|R

25|$|However, simple {{husbandry}} {{changes and}} practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock {{during times of}} maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The Culicoides midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, mending leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. <b>Dung</b> <b>heaps</b> or slurry pits should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.|$|R
40|$|Eggs of F. gigantica {{were placed}} in <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> that were located in the shade or exposed to sun light, and {{examined}} at intervals for up to 14 weeks. The rate and extent of decline in viability of eggs was greater in dung exposed to sun light than in shaded dung. This difference was attributed the higher temperature in dung in sun light, owing {{to the effect of}} direct sunlight and to a higher rate of fermentation in exposed than in shaded dung. It was concluded that strategies for storing dung that would reduce the risk it poses for infecting L. rubiginosa with F. gigantica when used as fertilizer in rice fields include storing dung in sun light rather than in the shade, preferably in a thin layer to allow sunlight to heat and desiccate it, and mixing a carbohydrate with the stored dung to increase heat through fermentation...|$|R

40|$|Many {{indirect}} {{methods of}} counting even-toed ungulates {{are based on}} the principle of accumulating dung in a known area per a unit of time. In order to provide the most accurate assessment of the population size, these methods require the knowledge of daily defecation of the monitored species. The main objective of the study submitted is the assessment of a daily defecation rate of fallow deer based on the monitoring of its closed population. A partial objective is the assessment of the distribution of fallow deer in an enclosed area with a view to biotopes represented. A fallow deer population was studied for the period of three years (2009 – 2011) in a fenced-in area (8 ha). During this period, <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> were counted in forty sites with the total area of 0. 8 ha in all seasons of the year.

Subsequently, the determined DDRs were verified by direct observation. The highest average DDR value calculated from the formula (21. 11 ± 0. 32 S. E.) was obtained in the summer season.

40|$|The {{grass snake}} owes its far {{northern}} distribution in Europe {{to the production}} and hoarding of dung from stock breeding. <b>Dung</b> <b>heaps</b> appear to be perfect breeding sites that surpass ‘natural’ reproduction sites in quality. Here we {{point out that the}} grass snake's dependency on manure goes back to Neolithic times and that it had a reciprocal cultural effect. Moreover, the positive influence of humans on the species not only resulted from physical opportunities offered by agriculture, but also from the fact that grass snakes were considered to be chthonic deities not to be harmed. The conversion of Europe to Christianity, however, marked the turning of the cultural tide for the species. From being a divine creature originally, the grass snake evolved into the number one symbol of the Anti-Christ: the basilisk. In spite of the subsequent witch-hunt motivated by Christian belief, the overall historical human influence on the species was certainly not detrimental as regarded geographical distribution opportunities. This historical perspective on grass snake-human relationships adds to the discussion of whether nature conservation is better served by a strategy of land sparing or of land sharing. It also makes clear not only that co-dependency of species is a matter of mutual biophysical advantages but that metaphysical considerations may also play a role. In this case it leads to the conclusion that bringing back the grass snake into our direct everyday surroundings is both favourable to the grass snake and reinstates the species in our own cultural environment...|$|R

40|$|Chronic copper {{poisoning}} {{was investigated}} in ruminants within the Phalaborwa area of the Kruger National Park (KNP). Exposure of ruminants to environmental copper pollution resulting from copper smelting operations of a mine in the area was examined by comparing impala faecal copper concentrations in <b>dung</b> <b>heaps</b> and tissue (liver, lung and kidney) copper concentrations of organs collected from impala and buffalo culled within three risk zones (high, moderate and low) {{of the study area}} in relation to the distance from the smelter over a period of 4 years. An additional area within the KNP not exposed to the environmental copper pollution from the mine served as control. Tissue copper accumulation was also determined in tracer impala placed in the highest risk zone. The results of this study confirmed the occurrence of chronic copper poisoning in impala and indicated an inverse relationship in extent of impala faecal copper elimination and in tissue copper accumulation in impala and buffalo with distance from the copper smelter. Impala liver copper concentrations were shown to be a reliable indicator of copper accumulation for these ruminants. The presence lung copper concentrations, indicating the exposure to airborne copper were the highest in impala culled in the zone closest to the smelter. Liver copper concentrations above the diagnostic limit of 150 ppm for chronic copper poisoning in domestic sheep were consistently found in impala within the highest risk zone. Clinical pathological measurements suggested that AST activity could possibly be used as an indicator for chronic copper poisoning in impala. It is concluded that, in addition to the environmental and geo-botanical evidence previously reported, the copper smelter of a nearby copper mine is the most likely source of copper pollution responsible for chronic copper poisoning in impala and the occurrence of high copper concentrations in buffalo in the Phalaborwa area of the KNP.

Further analysis showed that female cows were only slaughtered until after lactating age, indicating an emphasis on milk production. This excavation also found the remains of a domesticated dog, the first ever found at a Sirikwa site.

40|$|Terrestrial isopods of the Ooijpolder: part 1. {{distribution}} (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea) The distributions and habitats of woodlice {{were investigated}} in ‘the Ooijpolder’, also named ‘the Ooij’. The area of approximately 41 square kilometers is located {{along the river}} Waal, east of Nijmegen, Province of Gelderland, The Netherlands (fig. 2). In total 1464 squares of 100 x 100 m (utm) (fig. 9) were sampled by hand from 1991 up to 1998 (Table 1). On a recording form (fig. 5) five first order habitats were distinguished (Table 2) : 1. The river foreland is flooded on average {{for a few weeks}} once every winter or spring, and is bounded by a winterdyke. 2. The sandy river dunes in the flood plains are inundated only very occasionally. Three old brickstone factories are located here. 3. The Ooijpolder consists of sandy to heavy, young chalky river clays. Mainly rural, with some small villages and deciduous woods dominated by willow. 4. An area of very heavy, ill-drained clay soils (fig. 3), bounded by 5. 5. A lateral moraine deposited during the second last ice-age. Mainly mixed deciduous woodland dominated by oak and beech. On the recording form eight second order habitats were distinguished (see Table 2 for explanation). In the area 17 species of woodlice were found. Ligidium hypnorum was fairly common in wet habitats, especially wet ditches, canals and woodland, but it was absent on the lateral moraine. Surprisingly it proved unable to survive in the dynamic, periodically flooded foreland of the Waal (fig. 13). Haplophthalmus danicus was not widespread in the Ooijpolder, but at one particular site in a poplar woodland it occurred in extremely large numbers after a long period of heavy rains. Over a surface of 25 m 2 several hundred thousands of animals were observed. Furthermore H. danicus has been found to show a clear preference for the clayey soils containing some amount of sand, {{as well as for the}} habitats richest in humus, e. g. dead wood and heaps of litter. Some records were from synanthropic sites such as compost heaps and gardens. However the habitats at the base of the lateral moraine seemed to be natural. Compared with H. mengii the species is more thermophilic. Haplophthalmus mengii is essentially a soil-dwelling species. The data on distribution and ecology show a striking resemblance with T. helveticus (fig. 20, 21). Their migration patterns were very similar (fig. 38). Of both species the females moved to the deeper levels of the soil when breeding. Haplophthalmus mengii had a long reproduction period, from the second half of april to the end of october. Interestingly the newly hatched juveniles of both species of Haplophthalmus had already developed the seventh body segment (fig. 22). The first population of Hyloniscus riparius for The Netherlands in natural habitats was found in the Ooijpolder in 1991 (Wijnhoven 1993). The distribution map (fig. 25) shows its strong association with the floodplains. Hyloniscus riparius proved to be able to survive submerged conditions for over eight weeks. It is suggested the species has arrived here rather recently by means of passive transportation by river debris or actively by expanding its range from Germany to the west. It is found in woodland litter and alongside ditches and canals, where it was often quite abundant. Until now Metatrichoniscoides leydigii is still primarily a ‘Dutch’ species. In the Ooijpolder it has been captured only a few times (fig. 30). It can be expected to be badly under-recorded because of its small size and soil-dwelling habit. It has been found mainly between 10 to 30 cm under the soil surface, often in soil types quite poor of humus. The pretty pink colored Trichoniscoides helveticus was my favorite species. It is essentially a soildwelling woodlouse. It was common in ditches and along canals. The animals’ migrations are illustrated in figure 38. Probably the heavy, ill-drained clay soils can not be colonised by T. helveticus because in cold winter periods the rising water level can reach the frozen surface layer (fig. 38). The breeding season started at the end of April up to the beginning of October. The low incidence of gravid females in populations, reported for several small trichoniscids, is undoubtedly a bias of collecting by hand. In the second part of this publication will be discussed in detail that most females migrate to deeper levels in the soil when breeding starts. These vertical migrations lead to a greater relative number of males near the surface levels of the soil. Trichoniscoides albidus is quite common in the western parts of The Netherlands. Towards the east the species progressively is less frequently recorded. In the Ooijpolder it seems to be introduced, because of its strong association with draining canals of fruit plantations. It prefers habitats with a high humidity, rich in humus. In the study area Trichoniscus pusillus pusillus was extremely abundant and widespread. Trichoniscus pusillus was acting as the most important host for IIV (Isopod Iridescent Virus) (Wijnhoven & Berg 1999). Only one male specimen was collected. Trichoniscus pygmaeus was one of the rarest species in the Ooij. It was captured once in a garden. The other sites, ditches and ponds, seemed to be natural. Yet T. pygmaeus is likely to be an introduced species. The distribution map of Oniscus asellus showes a preference for rural and wooded areas, whereas the domestic and urban sites were under-recorded. It was very common in association with dead wood and litter in a wide range of natural and synanthropic habitats. Philoscia muscorum, together with T. pusillus, was the most abundant species. It was found in dry roadside verges as well as in wet deciduous woods. The red colourform seemed to occur mainly in woodlands and shrubs. Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii is known for its association with ant nests. In the clayey soils however it was frequently found without any ants or nests nearby. It is essentially a specialised soil-dwelling species. Like the small trichoniscids it seemed unable to colonise the heavy clay soil area (fig. 58). The species is probably common and widespread in the Ooijpolder, thus being badly under-recorded. Armadillidium vulgare was recorded from synanthropic habitats like old brickstone factories. In ‘natural’ habitats it is associated with the more or less calcareous microsites. Regularly adults and juveniles were observed living in quite humid conditions such as wet ditches and canals. Porcellio scaber was less abundant than expected. The distribution map shows its preference for the drier soiltypes. In synanthropic habitats the species always dominated, together with O. asellus. In woodlands on the free-draining slopes of the lateral moraine it was found most frequently. As reported by many authors Porcellio spinicornis essentially is synanthropic in the northern regions of Europe. In the monitored area its xerophilic nature is reflected by the distribution map (fig. 66). Although large and conspicuous, it is often difficult to find at daytime. Yet, on the whole P. spinicornis seemed rare due to the scarseness of suitable habitats. It was common at the old brickstone factories. Once it has been found in a greenhouse and in a church. The other records are from gardens where it occurred on walls with mortar. There is no doubt that the urban habitats were under-recorded, since in the city of Nijmegen the species was widespread. Porcellionides pruinosus, like P. spinicornis, is a synanthropic species. However, in contrast to P. spinicornis its presence was primarily related to sheep <b>dung</b> and <b>heaps</b> of mushroom compost. Once it was found in crevices of brickstone churchwalls. The distribution map of Trachelipus rathkii (fig. 72) shows a vicariant pattern with those of P. scaber and O. asellus. In the sequel to this paper will be discussed that this might well be the result of competition. Trachelipus rathkii, like H. riparius, can survive submerged for several weeks, explaining its abundance on the flood plains. In the polder it was recorded mainly in the open fields, avoiding wooded areas. Part 2 of this paper will be published in a next volume of Nederlandse Faunistische Mededelingen. The records will be analysed in detail, e. g. relations with soil types, groundwater level and the amounts of calciumcarbonate in the soil. The first and second order habitats will be discussed, as well as: the association of the mite Bakerdania elliptica with Oniscus asellus, the fenology of woodlice, breeding biology, sex ratio, deseases, parasites and predators...|$|R
