In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah."

500|$|Originally, the singer's {{recording}} label, Capitol Records, {{was against}} {{the inclusion of the}} song as a track on Teenage Dream as they deemed [...] "Peacock" [...] too controversial. [...] "They were all a bit worried about the word 'cock' and it gave me déjà vu because they did the exact same thing with 'I Kissed a Girl,'" [...] Perry stated. Unhappy with the idea of making her music more family friendly, she insisted on including the songs the label objected to. [...] "They said, 'We don't see it as a single, we don't want it on the album.' And I was like, 'You guys are idiots'." [...] When asked about [...] "Peacock", Perry stated: [...] "I'm hoping it will be a gay-pride anthem, peacocks represent a lot of individuality..... It's not just like, 'I wanna see your bulge. And then she went on to clarify: [...] "It does have the word cock in it, but art is also in fart! It's all in <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] Prior to the release of Teenage Dream, the singer debuted [...] "Peacock" [...] in early August 2010 when she performed it at the MTV World Stage in Malaysia.|$|E

50|$|Some {{mathematical}} rule-patterns can be visualised, {{and among}} these are those that explain patterns in nature including the mathematics of symmetry, waves, meanders, and fractals. Fractals are mathematical patterns that are scale invariant. This means that {{the shape of the}} pattern does not depend on <b>how</b> closely <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. Self-similarity is found in fractals. Examples of natural fractals are coast lines and tree shapes, which repeat their shape regardless of what magnification you view at. While self-similar patterns can appear indefinitely complex, the rules needed to describe or produce their formation can be simple (e.g. Lindenmayer systems describing tree shapes).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the early 1900 s {{approach}} to women who have been raped in Karlstad and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> rape during this period. I have used criminal case files from the Karlstad criminal police to examine. The actual study is set up in that way that I have tried to answer my questions through case studies that have been categorized in three type’s perpetrators and three types of victims. The three types of offenders who I am using are the "the naughty young man," "the violent worker" and "the drunken man". The three types victims I have used are "the innocent girl", "the gullible young woman" and "heroine".   A read thread in the survey is to investigate whether the women in rape cases are seen as subjects or not. This means that the focus lays on how the women have acted in the assault.   Some conclusions I come to is that the perception of rape in Karlstad during the years 1900 - 1943 are consistent with previous research in the sense that women are seen as the subject of rape and the focus lies on the women morality. You can see this because neither of the cases went on to the court. The women’s description of the assault is more often very specific, more so then the men’s description. The woman often needs to describe and defend why they were alone or why they were on that place at that time and what they did before the assault...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the weeks}} and months {{following}} Stonewall, a dramatic increase in gay political organizing took place. Among the many groups that formed was the Gay Activists Alliance, which focused more exclusively on organizing around gay issues and less of the general leftist political perspective taken by such other new groups as the Gay Liberation Front and Red Butterfly. GAA member Marty Robinson is credited with developing the zap following a March 7, 1970, police raid on a gay bar called the Snake Pit. [...] Police arrested 167 patrons. One, an Argentine national named Diego Vinales, so feared the possibility of deportation that he leapt from a second-story window of the police station, impaling himself on the spikes of an iron fence. Gay journalist and activist Arthur Evans later recalled how the raid and Vinales' critical injuries inspired the technique: The Snake Pit incident truly outraged us, and we put out a leaflet saying that, in effect, regardless of <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it, Diego Vinales was pushed out the window and we were determined to stop it....There was no division for us between the political and personal. We were never given the option to make that division. We lived it. So we decided that {{people on the other side}} of the power structure were going to have the same thing happen to them. The wall that they had built protecting themselves from the personal consequences of their political decisions was going to be torn down and politics was going to become personal for them.|$|R

After a decade of work in anime series, Yamadera was pleased to secure his first leading role, but Unshō Ishizuka, Jet's voice actor, was surprised that Yamadera was not cast as Jet. The two characters were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. Spike's English voice actor, Steven Blum, used film noir imagery to get himself in the right frame of mind to voice the character, but experienced some difficulty portraying in scenes where he was showing vulnerability. Reflecting on his performance, Blum said [...] "there were a few lines here and there that I felt were awkward, and could have been smoothed out better." [...] He called Spike an [...] "example of a character [...] didn't fully appreciate until the series was over", adding {{that he would like}} to reprise his role as the character if given the chance. Spike's portrayal was expanded in [...] Specifically, according to Yamadera, the character displayed more of his inner thoughts and showed a gentler side than he did in the series. This was because the team had more time available to express such details. Blum found his performance in the movie one of his most difficult from an emotional standpoint, as there were scenes where Spike was portrayed quite differently from the version he had been playing in the series.|$|R
