5000|$|On its {{launch in}} 1979, the Alfa 6 was the {{flagship}} of the Alfa Romeo range. The four-door body was fairly conventional {{and used a}} similar style to the existing Alfa Romeo Alfetta, and in fact both vehicles share {{a great number of}} parts, including door panels; Design work on the 6 was done prior to the Alfa Romeo Alfetta, but the fuel crisis of 1973 delayed further development and led to the 6's belated 1979 debut. The styling was not particularly aerodynamic but the drag coefficient was a somewhat respectable 0.41.

5000|$|Coal supply: Despite {{abundant}} {{reserves of}} coal, the country isn't producing {{enough to feed}} its power plants. India's monopoly coal producer, state-controlled Coal India, is constrained by primitive mining techniques and is rife with theft and corruption. Poor coal transport infrastructure has worsened these problems. To expand its coal production capacity, Coal India needs to mine new deposits. However, most of India's coal lies under protected forests or designated tribal lands. Any mining activity or land acquisition for infrastructure in these coal-rich areas of India, has been rife with political demonstrations, social activism and public interest litigations. By the end of year 2015, the international coal prices have dropped to US$42.55 per ton which is below the local coal producers sale price. This situation is transforming coastal power station's generation cheaper than pit <b>head</b> <b>power</b> station's generation when electricity is made available to major load centers. Being massive consumer of local and imported coal, India should end the Coal India's coal pricing monopoly and implement coal trading in commodities stock exchange to arrive at market determined coal price on daily basis. This is possible by devising standard coal grades / trading instruments and identifying coal supply hubs in central India, eastern India, west coast and east coast to facilitate trading in imported and local coal.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a physics-based simulation model, aimed at predicting the performance curves of pumps as turbines (PATs) {{on the basis of the}} performance curves of the respective pump. The simulation model implements the equations to be used for the estimation of <b>head,</b> <b>power</b> and efficiency for reverse operation. In particular, its calibration on a given machine is performed by using loss coefficients and specific parameters. The tuning parameters are identified by means of an optimization procedure, which is first applied to pumps and subsequently to PATs. The simulation model is calibrated on literature data, reporting both pump and PAT performance curves for <b>head,</b> <b>power</b> and efficiency over the entire range of operation. The performance data were acquired experimentally on four different turbomachines, running in both pump and PAT mode and characterized by specific speed values in the range 1. 53 - 5. 82. The reliability of the predictions of the physics-based simulation model is quantitatively assessed against both pump and PAT experimental performance curves. Prediction consistency from a physical point of view is also evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Geotechnical risks play an {{important}} role in the selection of tunneling method and machine types. In order to prevent some geological and geotechnical hazards during tunneling, selecting the most appropriate tunneling machine is very important. In this research study the main geotechnical hazards of tunneling by roadheader with their common mitigation measures are discussed. At present, three roadheader are excavating the three drifts of the Tabas coal mine in Iran. Hence, these drifts were used in this research study. The risk assessment matrix method in these tunnels showed that there is a lower risk of tunneling by roadheader than utilising the drilling and blasting method. The determined geotechnical risk assessment showed that the transverse cutter head was more suitable in comparison to a longitudinal cutter head for such tunnels. Then by using an instantaneous cutting rate model, the cutter <b>head</b> <b>power</b> of the roadheader was determined. According to the model, a lightweight roadheader with a cutter <b>head</b> <b>power</b> of about 80 - 110 KW and 40 t weight are suitable.

In surveying past jurisprudence it is to be expected that some example of patterns between the appropriate test of fit, and the <b>head</b> of <b>power</b> under which the federal legislation is valid, will be found. Such patterns exist not only because of a possible degree of similarity between the federal legislation which falls under any one <b>head</b> of <b>power,</b> but also for the reason that certain federal <b>heads</b> of <b>power,</b> for example, s. 92(10), are narrow and distinct powers which relate to particular works and undertakings and are thus quite susceptible to having provisions [...] "tacked-on" [...] to legislation which is validated under them, while other federal <b>heads</b> of <b>power,</b> for example, trade and commerce, are broad and therefore less likely to give rise to highly intrusive provisions.|$|R
