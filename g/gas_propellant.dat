2500|$|Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the {{ammunition}} {{used in the}} marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs {{is dependent on the}} brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery [...] "splat" [...] that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort {{to move away from the}} traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO2 <b>gas</b> <b>propellant,</b> to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more [...] "eco-friendly".

50|$|The Gemini 10 device used by Michael Collins {{received}} its nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> {{from inside the}} spacecraft, through a hose bundled with the astronaut's umbilical connector. Collins successfully used it to {{move back and forth}} between the Gemini and the Agena Target Vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> usually {{involves}} {{some sort of}} compressed gas. However, due to the low density of the gas and high weight of the pressure vessel required to contain it, gases see little current use, but are sometimes used for vernier engines, particularly with inert propellants like nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Cold <b>gas</b> <b>propellants</b> {{may be used}} to fill an {{expansible}} bag or membrane, such as an automotive airbag (<b>gas</b> generator <b>propellants)</b> or in pressurised dispensing systems, such as aerosol sprays, {{to force}} a material through a nozzle. Examples of can propellants include nitrous oxide that is dissolved in canned whipped cream, and the dimethyl ether or low-boiling alkane used in hair spray. Rocket propellant may be expelled through an expansion nozzle as a cold gas, that is, without energetic mixing and combustion, to provide small changes in velocity to spacecraft by the use of cold gas thrusters.|$|R

50|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the <b>gas</b> <b>propellants</b> used in aerosol spray cans, {{became a}} target for {{environmental}} concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated {{that they had a}} harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international Montreal Protocol of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, a {{technology}} competing against the nebulizer was launched by Riker Laboratories (3M), {{in the form}} of pressurized metered-dose inhalers, with Medihaler-iso (isoprenaline) and Medihaler-epi (adrenaline) as the two first products. In these devices, the drug is cold-fill and delivered in exact doses through some special metering valves, driven by a <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> technology (i.e. Freon or a less environmentally damaging HFA).|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of Cernan's experience, the AMU never again flew on Gemini, as it was not {{essential}} to developing technology for the Apollo Moon landing mission. Maneuvering units were not tested in space until February 1984, when a modified version called the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) was flown by astronaut Bruce McCandless on Space Shuttle mission STS-41-B. The MMU used nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>propellant,</b> which remains cold when vented.|$|E
5000|$|The steel aerosol {{spray can}} with the <b>gas</b> <b>propellant,</b> and [...] "crimp on nozzle" [...] was {{developed}} in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The <b>gas</b> <b>propellant,</b> usually a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international Montreal Protocol of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons. The disposable diaper was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by Procter & Gamble Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when Clairol began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag (Bin bag) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, George de Mestral, velcro, a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan.|$|E

50|$|A {{metered-dose inhaler}} {{consists}} of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing, where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs., The formulation itself {{is made up of}} the drug, a liquefied <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> and, in many cases, stabilising excipients. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.|$|E
50|$|The {{advanced}} {{ion engine}} uses 10 times less propellant than equivalent chemical rockets, it can process {{three times the}} power of previous designs, and increase efficiency by 50%. It will use the Hall-effect, which provides low acceleration but can fire continuously {{for many years to}} thrust a large mass to high speed. Hall effect thrusters trap electrons in a magnetic field and use them to ionize the onboard xenon <b>gas</b> <b>propellant.</b> The magnetic field also generates an electric field that accelerates the charged ions creating an exhaust plume of plasma that pushes the spacecraft forward. The spacecraft concept would have a dry mass of 5.5 tons, and could store up to 13 tons of xenon propellant.|$|E
50|$|MagBeam {{propulsion}} uses a helicon {{plasma source}} {{to produce a}} plasma beam. A helicon drive consists of a quartz tube wrapped in a radio antenna, into which a gas such as argon or xenon is injected. RF currents pass through the antenna creating a rapid variation of the electric field, ionizing the gas. The ionized gas is accelerated by a magnetic field to produce thrust. The helicon drive produces a tight beam of ions as the magnetic field that accelerates them continuously expands with the plasma beam keeping them focused. This ion beam is used to push a payload which {{is equipped with a}} small amount of gas for propellant such as argon or xenon, a power source and a set of electromagnets to produce a mini-magnetosphere magnetic sail. The <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> is ejected into the plasma beam being directed at the craft which heats and ionizes it.|$|E

40|$|The use of fuel-rich solid (<b>gas</b> generator-type) <b>propellants</b> for hybrid {{propulsion}} affords some design and utilization efficiency advantages. Both forward and aft liquid injection control concepts are evaluated from the operational standpoints of ballistics, throttling, stability and extinguishment. Steady-state and non-steady ballistics analyses are employed for this evaluation. Stability of solid motor operation {{is enhanced by}} fluid injection with adequate injector pressure drop. Efficient throttling and reliable extinguishment are attained {{through a combination of}} solid propellant combustion tailoring, grain design, control valves and sensors. Initial results from a laboratory-scale slab combustor, combining a <b>gas</b> generator <b>propellant</b> with gaseous oxygen injection, are also presented...|$|R
5000|$|Caesium {{and mercury}} {{were used as}} a {{propellant}} in early ion engines designed for spacecraft propulsion on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The fuel was ionized by contact with a charged tungsten electrode. But corrosion by caesium on spacecraft components has pushed development {{in the direction of}} inert <b>gas</b> <b>propellants,</b> such as xenon, which are easier to handle in ground-based tests and do less potential damage to the spacecraft. [...] Xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft Deep Space 1 launched in 1998. Nevertheless, Field Emission Electric Propulsion thrusters that accelerate liquid metal ions such as caesium have been built.|$|R
5000|$|Airsoft {{guns are}} {{classified}} {{according to their}} operating principle, which can be spring-loaded, electric (battery-powered Automatic Electric Guns, Airsoft Electric Guns or [...] "AEGs"), or gas-powered (if these have a blowback feature they are known as [...] "GBBs"). Some companies produce full replicas of counterpart grenade launchers which fire a projectile spray of 6mm pellets by use of a high-powered spring mechanism or a compressed <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> (i.e. green gas, propane, compressed air, or CO2). There is also a type of airsoft gun that {{is powered by a}} single (HPA) high-pressure air tank and a battery pack to power the internal FCU [...] "Fire Control Unit" [...] computer board. These guns are often known for their high and adjustable ROF or [...] "rate of fire" [...] and durability.

5000|$|The medical company Boehringer Ingelheim also {{invented a}} new device named Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler in 1997. This new {{technology}} provides a metered dose to the user, as the liquid {{bottom of the}} inhaler is rotated clockwise 180 degrees by hand, adding a build up tension into a spring around the flexible liquid container. When the user activates {{the bottom of the}} inhaler, the energy from the spring is released and imposes pressure on the flexible liquid container, causing liquid to spray out of 2 nozzles, thus forming a soft mist to be inhaled. The device features no <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> and no need for battery/power to operate. The average droplet size in the mist was measured to a somewhat disappointing 5.8 micrometers, which could indicate some potential efficiency problems for the inhaled medicine to reach the lungs. Subsequent trials have proven this was not the case. Due to the very low velocity of the mist, the Soft Mist Inhaler in fact has a higher efficiency compared to a conventional pMDI. In 2000, arguments were launched towards the European Respiratory Society (ERS) to clarify/expand their definition of a nebulizer, as the new Soft Mist Inhaler in technical terms both could be classified as a [...] "hand driven nebulizer" [...] and a [...] "hand driven pMDI".|$|E
50|$|A {{propellant}} or propellent is {{a chemical}} substance {{used in the}} production of energy or pressurized gas that is subsequently used to create movement of a fluid or to generate propulsion of a vehicle, projectile, or other object. Common propellants are energetic materials and consist of a fuel like gasoline, jet fuel, rocket fuel, and an oxidizer. Propellants are burned or otherwise decomposed to produce the <b>propellant</b> <b>gas.</b> Other <b>propellants</b> are simply liquids that can readily be vaporized.|$|R

40|$|The TRW Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT) is an {{electromagnetic}} propulsion {{system that can}} provide high thrust efficiency {{over a wide range}} of specific impulse values. In its basic form, the PIT consists of a flat spiral coil covered by a thin dielectric plate. A pulsed gas injection nozzle distributes a thin layer of <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> across the plate surface {{at the same time that}} a pulsed high current discharge is sent through the coil. The rising current creates a time varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a strong azimuthal electric field above the coil. The electric field ionizes the <b>gas</b> <b>propellant</b> and generates an azimuthal current flow in the resulting plasma. The current in the plasma and the current in the coil flow in opposite directions, providing a mutual repulsion that rapidly blows the ionized propellant away from the plate to provide thrust. The thrust and specific impulse can be tailored by adjusting the discharge power, pulse repetition rate, and propellant mass flow, and there is minimal if any erosion due to the electrodeless nature of the discharge. Prior single-shot experiment,; performed with a Diameter diameter version of the PIT at TRW demonstrated specific impulse values between 2, 000 seconds and 8, 000 seconds, with thruster efficiencies of about 52 % for ammonia.

Customer acceptable spray quality and consistency during can lifetime iii. Conventional cans and filling technology There is only a feasible energy source which is inert gas (i. e. compressed air) to replace VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) and greenhouse gases, which must be avoided, to improve atomisation by generating gas bubbles and turbulence inside the atomiser insert and the actuator. This research concentrates on using "bubbly flow" in the valve stem, with injection of compressed gas into the passing flow, thus also generating turbulence. The new valve designed in this investigation using inert gases has advantageous over conventional valve with butane propellant using high viscous product (> 400 Cp) because, when the valving arrangement is fully open, there are negligible energy losses as fluid passes through the valve from the interior of the container to the actuator insert. The use of valving arrangement thus permits all pressure drops to be controlled, resulting in improved control of atomising efficiency and flow rate, whereas in conventional valves a significant pressure drops occurs through the valve which has a complex effect on the corresponding spray...|$|E
