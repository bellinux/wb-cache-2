Varenne and Minnucci faced, among others, American Fool's Goal and French mare Fan <b>Idole.</b> Varenne had the lead but was passed by Fan <b>Idole</b> in the stretch and {{finished}} second. After the race, Varenne was disqualified for running inside the pylons. Before the race, it seemed, according to Varenne's groom Iina Rastas, that Fan <b>Idole</b> got taken with Varenne. When Fan <b>Idole</b> in 2004 was retired from racing, Varenne was chosen to be her first stud.|$|E

6000|$|The {{leaves were}} of the finest vellum, with tastefully {{designed}} illuminations all round them. And what did these highly ornamental pages contain? To my unutterable amazement and disgust, they contained locks of hair, let neatly {{into the center of}} each page, with inscriptions beneath, which proved them to be love-tokens from various ladies who had touched the Major's susceptible heart at different periods of his life. The inscriptions were written in other languages besides English, but they appeared to be all equally devoted to the same curious purpose, namely, to reminding the Major of the dates at which his various attachments had come to an untimely end. Thus the first page exhibited a lock of the lightest flaxen hair, with these lines beneath: [...] "My adored Madeline. Eternal constancy. Alas, July 22, 1839!" [...] The next page was adorned by a darker shade of hair, with a French inscription under it: [...] "Clemence. <b>Idole</b> de mon âme. Toujours fidele. Helas, 2me Avril, 1840." [...] A lock of red hair followed, with a lamentation in Latin under it, a note being attached to the date of dissolution of partnership in this case, stating that the lady was descended from the ancient Romans, and was therefore mourned appropriately in Latin by her devoted Fitz-David. More shades of hair and more inscriptions followed, until I was weary of looking at them. I put down the book, disgusted with the creatures who had assisted in filling it, and then took it up again, by an afterthought. Thus far I had thoroughly searched everything that had presented itself to my notice. Agreeable or not agreeable, it was plainly of serious importance to my own interests to go on as I had begun, and thoroughly to search the book.|$|E
