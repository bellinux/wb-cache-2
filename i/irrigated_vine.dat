40|$|BACKGROUND: The primary {{strategy}} to control powdery mildew in Chilean vineyards involves periodic fungicide spraying, which {{may lead to}} many environmental and human health risks. This study aimed to implement and evaluate the effectiveness and economic feasibility of a novel Decision Support Strategy (DSS) {{to limit the number}} of treatments against this pathogen. An experiment was conducted between the 2010 and 2013 seasons in two <b>irrigated</b> <b>vine</b> fields, one containing a cultivar of Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) and another of Chardonnay (CH). [br/] RESULTS: The results showed that the DSS effectively controlled powdery mildew in CS and CH vine fields as evidenced by a disease severity lower than 3 %, which was lower than that observed in untreated vines (approximately 10 % and 40 % for CS and CH, respectively). The DS strategy required the application of only 2 - 3 fungicide treatments per season in key vine phenological stages, and the cost fluctuated between US $ 322 and 415 per hectare, which was 40 to 60 % cheaper than the traditional strategy employed by vine growers. CONCLUSION: The Decision Support Strategy evaluated in this trial allows a good control of powdery mildew for various types of epidemics with an early and late initiation...|$|E

In this study, we assessed the combined effects of radiation and water regimes on leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)), petiole specific hydraulic conductivity (K-petiole) and anatomy (vessel number and size); and leaf aquaporin gene expression of field-grown grapevines at the Agroscope Research Station (Leytron, Switzerland). Chasselas vines were subjected to two radiation (sun and shade) levels combined with two water (irrigated and water-stressed) regimes. The sun and shade leaves received similar to 61. 2 and 1. 48 mol m(- 2) day(- 1) of photosynthetically active radiation, respectively, during a clear-sky day. The <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> were watered weekly from bloom to veraison whereas the water-stressed vines did not receive any irrigation during the season.

The petioles from water-stressed vines showed fewer large-sized vessels than those from <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines.</b> The shaded leaves from the <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> exhibited a higher Kpetiole than the sun leaves {{at the end of}} the season, which was partially explained by a higher number of vessels per petiole and possibly by the upregulation of some of the aquaporins measured in the leaf.

40|$|Irrigation {{management}} is {{considered as a}} key element that contributes to enhance and sustain grapevine health and improve crop productivity and quality. Actually, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategy can modify vine canopy microclimate, through control and reduction of vine vegetative growth, providing a good air circulation and sunlight penetration. The present study evaluated the effect of two different water regimes (V 1 and V 2, corresponding to 100 and 80 % of estimated vine evapotranspiration, respectively) on vine performances, berries growth, and postharvest quality of organic 'Italia' table grape. To the purpose, field and postharvest surveys were conducted. In particular, during cold storage in semicommercial conditions, the development of rots, as well as microbiological and qualitative characteristics of the berries, were weekly assessed. Results showed that V 1 (full <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines)</b> improved vine development and induced an increase in vegetative and productive growth, while V 2 (moderate <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines)</b> appeared sufficient to achieve a complete table grape development. In addition, the berry sugar content and the titratable acidity did not change between the two irrigation treatments, but V 2 berries have higher berry firmness. This higher total berry compactness resulted in a lower susceptibility to abiotic and biotic stresses. The presence of fungi, mainly Penicillium spp., Botrytis cinerea, Cladosporium spp., and Aspergillus spp., showed some fluctuation over time, with a greater incidence on V 1 berries than on V 2 ones. In general, the disease index had an upward trend during the various assessments. Concluding, V 2 vines could provide satisfactory results concerning overall organic table grape quality. Reducing water demand for vineyard irrigation, the saved water can be diverted for alternative uses...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{effect of}} various {{irrigation}} strategies on grapevine water relations during the berry ripening period {{was investigated in}} a Shiraz/Richter 99 vineyard. Comparisons between different irrigation strategies (full/seasonal, véraison+post véraison, post véraison and no irrigation) were made. During the day, the seasonally <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> experienced less water stress than the deficit treatments. Non-irrigated vines seemed to maintain higher diurnal leaf water potentials. Lower leaf water potentials indicated lower water contents in the vegetative and reproductive tissue. Full irrigation seemed to stimulate primary shoot length. Longer water deficit induced earlier and more complete shoot maturation (reserve accumulation). Re-distribution of leaf area on the shoot may occur when vines are subjected to water deficit. Extended water deficit seemed to induce earlier and restricted water loss from vegetative tissue. The water relations were reflected in the berry size. Irrigation during ripening seemed to induce a continuation of berry water loss. Transpiration losses were apparently much higher in fully <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> whereas stomatal control efficiently maintained water relations in non-irrigated vines. Water deficit seemed to have enhanced the soluble solid accumulation. Irrigation treatments {{did not seem to}} affect the titratable acid and pH. The post véraison irrigation in particular seemed to favour a wide window for harvesting.

40|$|The {{response}} of grape berry metabolism to vine water status {{was investigated in}} field grown grapevines (Vitis vinifera cv. Castelão) in southern Portugal. Water was supplied as: full irrigation (FI), to minimum water deficit corresponding to 100 % of crop evapotranspiration (Etc), partial rootzone drying (PRD) and deficit irrigation (DI), both corresponding to an irrigation amount of 50 % Etc, and a rainfed, i. e. no irrigation treatment (NI). In PRD, water was supplied {{to one side of}} the root system during each irrigation period, alternating sides every 15 d approximately. During the growing period, PRD and DI vines showed intermediate pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) values (around - 0. 4 MPa) by the end of the growing season, FI vines - 0. 2 MPa and NI - 0. 8 MPa. Berry weight as well as the content of glucose and fructose per berry increased in <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> (PRD, DI, and FI) compared to NI vines. Although both malic and tartaric acid declined in non-irrigated vines, there was no significant difference between treatments at harvest. The activities of invertase, malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme were not affected by irrigation throughout the ripening process. The contribution of other factors involved in the reduction of sugars and organic acids in berries of non-irrigated vines are discussed. These results show that deficit irrigation, like PRD and DI, do not have any negative impact on growth and quality of grape berries compared to fully <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines,</b> but may result in improved berry quality compared to rainfed vines...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} drought and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on stomatal behaviour and gas exchange parameters, young kiwifruit vines (Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayward) were exposed to alternating periods of drought and drought-relief over two growing seasons. Vines were grown either in the field or in containers. Stomatal conductance of fully- expanded leaves rapidly decreased as pre-dawn leaf water potential was reduced below a threshold value of - 0. 3 MPa. Stomatal conductance reached minimum values of 10 - 20 mmol m- 2 s- 1. Transpiration rate was similarly sensitive to changes in leaf water status, whereas more severe drought levels were necessary to affect photosynthesis significantly. Net daily carbon gains were estimated at 4. 7 and 2. 7 g m- 2 for <b>irrigated</b> and droughted <b>vines,</b> respectively. Gas exchange parameters recovered to values of <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> {{within a few hours}} after relief of stress. Rate of recovery depended on the level of stress reached during the previous drought period. There was a steady decline in stomatal conductance when VPD was increased from 0. 8 to 2. 5 kPa in both <b>irrigated</b> and droughted <b>vines.</b> The VPD at which stomatal conductance reached 50 % of maximum values was 2. 1 - 2. 2 kPa for both treatments.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 This study {{integrates}} various vineyard {{practices that}} may improve nitrogen availability to the vine, particularly during ripening. Different strategies aimed at increasing yeast assimilable nitrogen in the fruit at harvest have been evaluated. This study seeks to improve fermentation behavior and wine quality through vineyard practices used for nitrogen management. The {{focus of this}} study is to optimize fruit quality and maximize the juice nitrogen fraction, while maintaining a physiologically healthy vine and crop system. Treatments were applied in a factorial design to vary irrigation, cultivation, and nitrogen application to Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapevines in two commercial Oregon vineyards during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. <b>Irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> received supplemental irrigation after lag phase. Cultivation of alternate rows was performed in early spring to encourage nitrogen utilization and reduce nutrient and water competition. Nitrogen treatments consisted of soil-applied urea (39. 2 kgN/ha), foliar applied urea (2. 98 kgN/ha), and zero nitrogen. Soil nitrogen was applied in early spring. Foliar nitrogen was applied once at the onset of ripening and again at veraison. The trials were established at Knudsen Vineyard located in the North Willamette Valley and Benton Lane Vineyard in the South Willamette Valley in 1999. At Benton Lane Vineyard, photosynthesis, transpiration, water use efficiency, chlorophyll content, maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis, soil moisture, leaf petiole nutrition, pruning weights, and carbohydrate reserves were measured during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. Leaf water potentials were measured during the 2000 growing season. During both seasons <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> assimilated CO₂ and transpired at a significantly higher rate than non-irrigated vines. Similarly, tilled treatments assimilated CO₂ at a significantly higher rate and maintained higher water use efficiency. Tilling tended to increase the efficiency of light driven photosynthetic reactions and chlorophyll content. This response became more apparent in the second year of the study, which may indicate a delayed effect of soil cultivation on maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis and chlorophyll content in grapevines. Nitrogen treatments had little impact on leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll content. Soil Cultivation had the largest impact on petiole nutrient content, with significant differences in phosphorus, potassium, manganese, copper, boron, carbon and total nitrogen. Irrigation increased total petiole nitrogen in the second year of the study. Pruning weights increased with cultivation in both years and cane weights were higher after the second year. Irrigation and nitrogen did not affect vine vigor. Ripening dynamics, juice composition, and yield components were measured at both vineyards during the 1999 and 2000 growing seasons. During both seasons, <b>irrigated</b> Pinot noir <b>vines</b> had lower titratable acidity than non-irrigated vines and tilled treatments had higher soluble solids than non-tilled treatments. Tilled Chardonnay vines had lower soluble solids and higher titratable acidity in 2000. In 1999, from the onset of ripening until harvest, the ammonia content of Pinot noir fruit decreased from an average of 80 to 30 (mg/L) while the alpha amino acid content increased from 60 to 150 (mg/L) during ripening. The YANC of Pinot noir vines increased from 100 to 190 (mg/L), predominately due to a large increase in alpha amino acid concentration in the last two weeks of maturation. For both Pinot noir and Chardonnay, the results from 2000 indicate that tilled treatments tend to have higher YANC at harvest, predominately due to a large increase in alpha amino acids. Significant effects from tilling suggest that there may be a delayed benefit from soil cultivation. <b>Irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> tended to have a higher berry weight, however, yield components differed only slightly between treatments and year...|$|R

Crimson Seedless is a late season red {{table grape}} {{developed}} in 1989, {{with a high}} market value and increasingly cultivated under protected environments to extend the availability of seedless table grapes into the late fall. The purpose of this work was to evaluate leaf water potential and sap flow as indicators of water stress in Crimson Seedless vines under standard and reduced irrigation strategy, consisting of 70 % of the standard irrigation depth. Additionally, two sub-treatments were applied, consisting of normal irrigation throughout the growing season and a short irrigation induced stress period between veraison and harvest.

To evaluate the effect of water stress on infection of grapevines by Botryosphaeriaceae spp., 1 -year-old Shiraz/ 101 - 14 Mgt nursery grapevine plants were planted in plastic potting bags and placed outdoors under shade netting. Five weeks after planting, vines were pruned and the pruning wounds inoculated with spore suspensions of Neofusicoccum australe, Neofusicoccum parvum, Lasiodiplodia theobroma e or Diplodia seriata. Control treatments consisted of applications of sterile water or a Trichoderma harzianum spore suspension. Stem inoculations were done by inserting a colonised or uncolonised agar plug into a wound made in each stem. Four different irrigation regimes were introduced 12 weeks after planting to simulate varying degrees of water stress. Measurements of stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and leaf spectrometry were made to monitor physiological stress. Eight months after inoculation, vines were uprooted and the root, shoot and plant mass of each vine determined. Lesions observed in the inoculated pruning wounds and stems were also measured. Vines subjected to the lowest irrigation regime were significantly smaller than optimally <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines.</b> Water stressed vines also had significantly lower photosynthetic rates and levels of stomatal conductance compared with vines receiving optimal irrigation, indicating that these plants experienced significantly higher levels of physiological stress. The mean lesion length was significantly longer in the pruning wounds and stems of plants subjected to the lowest irrigation regime, with lesion length declining linearly with increasing irrigation volume. These results clearly indicate that when a grapevine is exposed to water stress, colonisation and disease expression by Botryosphaeriaceae spp. are much more severe. </span...|$|R

The greenhouse study was replicated four times (6 months each run) and the field study ran from the 2005 / 2006 season through the 2006 / 2007 season. Application of PRD to vines resulted in a unique physiological response distinct from other established deficit irrigation procedures such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI); however, the overall physiological responses of the vines were defined by the environmental conditions of the vineyard where the experiment occurred.

For this purpose, during the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, a Merlot experimental vineyard was set up in the experimental farm of the University of Udine. In the present communication we present the results of the 2013 season. The experiment design was a full 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of irrigation imposed at berry set as the first factor (I- <b>Irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> and stem water potential maintained between - 0. 3 and - 0. 6 MPa; and D-water deficit vines, with stem water potential maintained between - 0. 8 and - 1. 4 MPa). The vineyard was sheltered by a tunnel covered by EVA film and water was supplied by a sub-surface drip irrigation system. Two levels of summer trimming (applied at the end of veraison, that is when at least 80 % of all berries had changed color) was the second factor.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The South African and {{international}} table grape industries are growing rapidly, which necessitates {{the production of}} high quality export fruit at competitive production costs. For this reason, alternative irrigation methods are required to utilise water optimally while still attaining good quality table grapes. An increase in agricultural productivity may be dependent on either the availability of more water for irrigation or {{an increase in the}} efficiency of water use. The first aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the Partial Rootzone Drying (PRD) irrigation strategy in Crimson Seedless and Dauphine table grape production. This irrigation system is based on the drying of half of the vine roots, thereby allowing the plant to produce hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) in reaction to water stress. The hormone production in turn results in stomatal closure and the reduction of water loss via transpiration. The drying cycle is then repeated after 10 to 15 days on the other side of the <b>vine,</b> <b>irrigating</b> the previously dried roots. PRD will encourage a consistent production of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), without actual water stress. This strategy reduces the amount of water used for irrigation, without an accompanying loss in fruit yield, as compared to conventional techniques. In this study, conventionally treated <b>vines</b> were <b>irrigated</b> according to historical block data and PRD-treated <b>vines</b> were <b>irrigated</b> at the same times. The second aim of this study was to monitor the efficacy of a foliar nutrient, Croplife. This foliar nutrient allegedly improves the uptake of foliar applied nutrients, assists with transport of all minerals through the leaves and enables the plant to attain higher pest and disease resistance thresholds. Conventionally treated vines that did not receive foliar nutrient treatment were compared to vines that received foliar nutrients as prescribed by the manufacturer. Vine cultivars Crimson Seedless and Dauphine, were grown under open hydroponic principles with drip and drip irrigation respectively in this experiment. For the hydroponic vines (Crimson Seedless), all vines were situated in the same row and 72 vines were divided into mini-plots of three vines. Treatments were then assigned to an equal number of plots at random. The same procedure was followed for the drip <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines</b> (Dauphine) but the vines were situated in two rows of equal length. Treatment effects were followed from budburst until harvest, where after post-harvest analyses were conducted. The first aim, namely to show that PRD is an effective irrigation strategy for table grape production in Crimson Seedless and Dauphine cultivars, has shown that vines did not exhibit signs of stress even though they received only half the conventional amount of water. This study was conducted over only one growth season and therefore no definite conclusions could be drawn about the long term effectiveness of PRD on table grapes. It did, however, confirm numerous results obtained from different studies on the use of PRD in wine grape production. The results obtained in the second part of the study were inconclusive and could not show that Croplife is effective in improving the uptake and transport of applied foliar nutrients. Because Crimson Seedless is cultivated under open hydroponic principles, nutrients can be absorbed by the roots via the soil and micronutrients are also available from chemical sprays during the season. There was no evidence to indicate that the use of Croplife increased nutrient absorption and transport, neither did it supplement or detract form the observed effect of PRD. Despite the limitations experienced during this study, it has shown that the use of PRD for table grape production may be a useful tool for improving water utilisation efficiency in future. The strategy will have to be developed systematically through experimentation to fully unlock the potential of the PRD management system for table grape production. This study provides a good starting point for future research required to elucidate numerous aspects of the PRD system and has clearly shown that established vineyards can be switched to a PRD system without a loss in table grape quality. It is envisaged that the advantages of this system could have a positive effect on the production of high quality fruit for the international market...|$|R

Understanding the rationale leading farmers to adapt to climate change is thus a major challenge forwater management because one of the strategies to adapt to increasing crop water requirement is irrigation. Thiswill induce new water demands, thus understanding the determinants of irrigation choice is a challenge for robustwater planification both in terms of water conveyance infrastructure planning and environmental impacts onwater resources. It is also a central issue for agricultural economics and policy. One of our main assumptions tothis analysis is to state that climate change {{is just one of the}} multiple changes farmers are facing together withregulatory changes (right to irrigate on a regular basis since 2006), economic changes linked to the changesin consumers demand and wine market in general, and technical changes. Adaptation must be seen as a responseto all the perceived changes and not to a particular one, apriori. Also, adaptation has always been at the core offarmer’s experience. In order to explore these questions, we concentrate on the case of wine growers in South-East France (Languedoc-Roussillon) where the context is changing: irrigation is authorized on a regular basis since 2006 only and a largewater conveyance infrastructure is being constructed enabling for new water resources. We surveyed winegrowers in Languedoc-Roussillon via a detailed Internet questionnaire sent to more than 3000 winegrowers tounderstand the determinants of agricultural practices and strategic choices (planting, structural size change,commercialization). The diffusion of the questionnaire was realized via the mail listings of professional organisms(Chambre d’agriculture, cooperatives [...] .). We collected data on current and future practices relative to soilplantwater management, perceptions of past economic, regulatory, technical and climate changes and social andeconomic characteristics such as objectives that wine growers are pursuing with their activity (improving winequality, preserving tradition, etc.). For all completed and validated survey variables characterizing the terroir aresystematically associated to each farm: rain, temperature, soil water capacity, elevation. A representative sample of 363 wine growers is used for a descriptive and econometric analysis. 30 % of our sampleis already <b>irrigating</b> <b>vine</b> while up to 28 % is considering this option. When facing a climate change scenario by 2050, 57 % of those not currently irrigating say they would implement irrigation. This illustrates the importanceof anticipating future demand for water irrigation. We consider two main types of determinants and explore theirrelative contribution in explaining the adoption of water management practices at farm level. Terroir-like variablesand socio-economic variables, including main objectives that vine growers are pursuing with their activity areexplored as determinants. The results confirmed that both terroir and socio-economic determinants play a significantrole in the implementation of adaptation actions among which irrigation. Perceptions of past changes aredeterminants of adaptations: for instance perceptions of regulatory changes are determinants of existing irrigationwhereas perception of climate change is a determinant of having the project to irrigate in the future.

Using a system combining passive heating (greenhouse effect) and active cooling (fans) to control daytime temperature, we compared vines heated to a nominal maximum of 40 °C for three consecutive days and untreated controls. Maximum air temperature in heated treatments was 7. 3 °C (2006 – 07) and 6. 5 °C (2007 – 08) above ambient. Heat episodes were aligned with the beginning of a weekly irrigation cycle and applied in one of four phenological windows, namely post-fruit set, pre-veraison, veraison and pre-harvest. Heating systems did not affect relative humidity, hence vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was increased in the heated treatments and tracked the daily cycle of temperature. Heat did not affect the dynamics of berry growth and sugar accumulation, except for a 16 % reduction in berry size and sugar content in vines heated shortly after fruit set in 2006 – 07. Vines upregulated stomatal conductance and gas exchange in response to heat. Stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration at a common VPD were consistently higher in heated vines than in controls. We suggest that stomatal behaviour previously described as part of Shiraz anisohydric syndrome may be adaptive in terms of heat tolerance at the expense of short-term transpiration efficiency.

Grenache wines under non-irrigated conditions. Methods and results: The effects of timing of defoliation (fruit set and veraison) on yield components, berry maturity, wine composition and sensory properties of head trained, non <b>irrigated,</b> Grenache <b>vines</b> grown in Rioja appellation were studied. Leaf removal did not significantly modify total leaf area per vine as well as yield components. Grenache berries from early defoliated vines achieved the highest skin and technological maturity. Wine parameters, such as alcohol content, pH, titratable acidity, tartaric acid and total polyphenol index were unaffected by defoliation. Conversely, early leaf removal carried out at fruit set, significantly reduced the malic acid content of the wine and enhanced its colour intensity. Aroma complexity, mouthfeel, tannin quality and persistence were found to be significantly higher in the wine corresponding to the early leaf removal treatment. This was also the most preferred wine in terms of overall value. Conclusion: This article shows that timing of leaf removal had a marked effect on berry maturity, wine composition and sensory properties of Grenache wines made from grapes grown under dry-farmed conditions. Significance and impact of study: The results suggest that the timing of defoliation induces significant changes in Grenache wine composition and its sensory attributes. Late leaf removal was much less effective than early leaf removal in affecting final wine composition and quality. Grenache wine from the early defoliation treatment was rated the most preferred as of global value. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The amount of water rather than the application of PRD had a more significant effect on vine response. Average berry weight was unaffected but yield and berry number was reduced through influences that arose the previous season as well as the current season. There was some evidence that the application of PRD resulted in the maintenance of leaf function as measured by photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance pre- and post-veraison, however, this difference was not reflected in yield or growth parameters. As indicated by high pH and low acid levels the relatively high evaporative demand and small rooting volume of the vines at this site resulted in the vines experiencing repeated periods of stress between irrigations. The contrasting results of different PRD studies, including this trial, clearly indicate that the response of vines to PRD treatments is not easily defined and that vine management, soil types, irrigation amount and climate {{play a critical role in}} a grapevine’s response to PRD.

40|$|Soluble solids {{concentration}} {{measured at}} harvest in the berry juice has progressively {{increased over the}} last decades. This condition causes the production of high-alcoholic wine, whereas nowadays consumers tend to prefer wine with a low alcoholic degree. The aim of this dissertation was to define a vineyard management practice effective in reducing berry juice soluble solids concentration without affecting negatively other compositional parameters of the berry. Three experiments were designed: (1) the first aimed {{to assess the impact}} of two different intensities of post-veraison shoot trimming or defoliation on vine performance, berry composition, and wine quality on the red cultivar Aglianico; (2) the second experiment aimed {{to assess the impact of}} shoot trimming applied at three different stages of berry ripening on vine performance, berry composition, and wine quality on the red cultivar Aglianico; (3) the third aimed to assess the impact of post-veraison defoliation on vine performance and berry composition on two red cultivars, Tempranillo and Bobal, exposed to different irrigation strategies. For the first experiment, the following treatments were compared over three years (2012 - 2014) (a) two different intensities of post-veraison defoliation (50 % and 75 % of leaves located on laterals were stripped off); (b) two different intensities of post-veraison shoot trimming (vines were trimmed cutting off the portion above the 7 th or 15 th node); (c) one control non-defoliated and non-trimmed. Treatments were applied when soluble solids concentration in berry juice was around 12 °Brix. For the second experiment the following treatments were compared over two years (2013 - 2014) : (a) three post-veraison shoot trimming applied at three phenological stages corresponding to berry soluble solids concentration of around 6, 12, or 18 °Brix; and (b) one non-trimmed control. From fruit set to harvest berry soluble solids concentration, pH, titratable acidity, and berry fresh and dry weight were assessed in both the experiments. In addition anthocyanin and polyphenol concentration of the berries were measured at harvest. Moreover, vegetative growth and net CO 2 exchange rate were measured in different dates during the growing season. Moreover, canopy solar radiation interception was measured in the first experiment. After harvest, wines were made with the grapes of each treatment and after fermentation wine composition and wine sensory characteristics were assessed by a professional panel test. In the third experiment the following treatments were compared in 2014 (for both the cultivars) : (a) <b>vines</b> <b>irrigated</b> and non-defoliated (I-ND), (b) <b>vines</b> <b>irrigated</b> and defoliated (I-D), (c) vines rainfed from pre-veraison to harvest and non-defoliated (NI-ND), (d) vines rainfed from pre-veraison to harvest and defoliated (NI-D). Defoliation was applied manually when the concentration of soluble solids was around 10 °Brix by stripping off six-seven main leaves (included leaves of laterals) from the upper part of the shoot. Berry soluble solids concentration, pH, the titratable acidity, the anthocyanin and polyphenols concentration; and the berry fresh weight and dry weight were regularly measured from leaf removal treatment to harvest. Moreover, vegetative growth, net CO 2 exchange rate, stomatal conductance and Ψstem were monitored. Moderate pruning treatments determined a significant reduction in berry juice soluble solids concentration and wine alcoholic degree compared to control. Moreover, these practices improved wine sensory score. Intense pruning treatments allowed to reduce berry soluble solids concentration, but they could cause negative effects on yield components, berry composition, and wine quality.

The relationships between climatic {{variables and the}} yield, and novel technological berry quality (QItechnologicalberry), phenolic berry quality (QIphenolicberry), overall berry quality (QIoverallberry), and wine quality (QIwine) indices confirmed {{that the most important}} climatic factors were rainfall, temperature, and radiation. Climate was more influential in determining yield, berry, and wine composition in some important physiological periods such as early season (budburst–fruit set) and ripening (véraison–harvest). In general, climate had more influence on berry quality than on wine quality indices and greater QIoverallberry was also reflected in greater QIwine. According to the stepwise multiple regression, the best fitted models for the partial root-zone drying irrigation (PRI) system were less complex (with a lower number of climatic variables) than for the regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) system, suggesting that PRI is less influenced by climatic factors than RDI. For PRI, the models for yield, berry and wine quality were explained by three climatic factors (rainfall, Tª, and radiation), whereas for RDI, more climatic factors came into play (number of hours of sunshine, evapotranspiration, and vapor pressure deficit). According to these models, in RDI, a sunny and drier pre-véraison period followed by higher soil water availability and associated greater crop evapotranspiration during ripening favored final berry and wine quality. In contrast, in PRI, greater rainfall during the growing season and greater solar radiation during ripening were the main climatic factors that positively influenced the yield response, berry and wine quality. Besides, berry quality in PRI was more affected (negatively) by high temperatures (high Tªmax and Tªmin) during the growing season than in RDI and SDI, indicating that cooler and humid years may favor the PRI response more. These results suggest that years with a cool, wet winter followed by a mild, wet spring and early summer (April–June) and a mild fruit set–véraison period (June–July), and then greater solar radiation during ripening (August–mid-September) provide adequate growth potential and increase the likelihood of higher berry and wine quality in PRI.

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Water {{scarcity}} {{is a key}} {{limiting factor}} for viticulture in dry regions. Traditionally drought sensitive varieties {{have the potential to}} grow in dry areas, however in most situations, through the use of rootstocks. Drought-tolerant rootstocks are expected to improve grapevine response to water deficit by improving the water uptake and transport and by reducing the water loss in leaves by root-to-shoot signalling. The mechanisms of rootstocks’ tolerance to drought are not yet fully understood. The main aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of the rootstock/scion-cultivar interaction in the regulation of grapevine water use and leaf stomatal behaviour. <b>Irrigated</b> field <b>vines</b> without any water constraint were compared to rain-fed grapevines subjected to moderate water constraint. To better manage vine water status, reduce variability, and compare more rootstocks, greenhouse trials were also conducted where plants were well watered or subjected to severe water constraints. Pinotage grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto 110 Richter, 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks were used for field experiments whereas Pinotage grapevines grafted onto 99 Richter, 110 Richter, 140 Ruggeri, 1103 Paulsen and Ramsey were used for greenhouse experiments. Our study suggested the influence of rootstocks on scion-cultivar water status and leaf stomatal size and density and gas exchange of the scion, implying an influence on water uptake and transport and a tight regulation of the stomatal conductance. Our data supported the hypothesis that the influence of rootstock in response to drought seemed to be higher under increasing water deficit up to a point where the plant water status is the main driver of the stomatal conductance and therefore photosynthesis regulation, considering the plant water status thresholds. In addition, the results suggested that stomatal development is affected by light, drought and possibly by rootstocks. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how the rootstock affects stomatal development and the link with scion-cultivar water use. It seems that the transpiration rate of leaves is more related to stomatal size than density. Thus one possible mechanism of Pinotage leaf adaptation to water constraints was structural during leaf growth, with a reduction in pore size to reduce plant water loss. The results showed that the rootstock is regulating the cultivar's stomatal size (anatomical changes during leaf growth) and functioning (stomatal regulation) through a complex signalling process. The effect of light on stomatal development is interesting in the context of canopy microclimate and canopy manipulation (choice of the vine architecture vs canopy size, in the context of climate change versus the possible increase in drought and water scarcity). The use of rootstocks is a long term investment which aims to provide resistance to soil pests and pathogens and to confer to the scion-cultivar drought and salt tolerance. The use of drought tolerant rootstocks is actually one of the most relevant practical solutions in dry terroir – units and in situations where water availability is limited. The understanding of the physiological and genetic mechanisms which govern scion-cultivar drought tolerance/behaviour induced by rootstocks is critical in terms of rootstocks choice in interaction with the scion-cultivar and is critical to assist breeding programs to create/select drought tolerant rootstocks...|$|R
40|$|Wine grape {{production}} in the semi-arid regions of Australia is successful due to the availability of irrigation water. Whilst water is a natural resource it is also becoming extremely valuable. In the hot and semi-arid regions of Australia, the prospect of water restrictions from drought and intensifying horticultural and domestic competition for water has prompted the grape and wine industry to implement strategic deficit irrigation practices to try and maintain sustainable wine grape production. Sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) differs significantly in its management to partial rootzone drying and regulated deficit irrigation and is a technique that could potentially be easily adopted across the winegrape industry if water allocations were reduced. With SDI, the water deficit is not created by withholding water, but rather, by applying a lesser volume of water at each irrigation event for the entire irrigation season. This study aimed to understand the physiological behaviour of wine grape cultivars to SDI and how this deficit irrigation strategy would influence yield and composition of the grapes and wine. The trials were conducted during 2003 - 2006 on the cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grafted to 140 Ruggeri (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris) rootstock and grown in the Murray-Darling region of Australia. Furthermore, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are the main red winegrape varieties grown in the Murray-Darling region, anectodally they are observed to respond differently to hot, dry conditions when managed under similar irrigation regimes. The <b>vines</b> were drip <b>irrigated</b> providing 100 % of estimated ETc (control) and three graded sustained water deficits (Cabernet Sauvignon 70 %, 52 % and 43 % of the control; Shiraz 65 %, 45 % and 34 % of the control). For each season, the volume of actual water applied (ML/ha) was calculated for each irrigation treatment and varied depending on seasonal and vineyard conditions. To further explore vine responses to water deficit, glasshouse studies on four own-rooted Vitis vinifera L. cultivars, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Grenache and Tempranillo were also conducted. Deficit irrigation management, whilst controlling vegetative growth and manipulating berry composition, may not always produce consistent outcomes among grapevine varieties. This has lead to the observation that deficit irrigation management strategies {{may need to be}} tailored to individual grape cultivars. Consequently, an understanding as to how certain grapevine varieties respond to water deficit, particularly in relation to physiological responses, could assist with linking any impacts that water deficits may have on grape and wine composition. Field-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz exposed to approximately 50 % SDI experienced significant reductions in leaf water potential and stomatal conductance compared to the control. By contrast, xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased significantly for the SDI-treated vines compared to the control that is probably related to root to shoot signals and canopy-derived ABA. Under field situations, Cabernet Sauvignon displayed physiological responses more typical of an isohydric-like (drought avoiding) vine, compared to the anisohydric-like (drought tolerant) responses of Shiraz. These responses may also be supported by the pattern of xylem sap [ABA] production. The differences in canopy development (leaf area index and pruning weights) for Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz may be a reflection of the isohydric-like and anisohydric-like responses of these grape varieties to water deficit, thereby influencing carbohydrate dynamics and long-term viability of vine health under SDI. After three seasons, the SDI treatments significantly reduced yield of the field-grown vines, primarily due to a reduction in berry weight that tended to occur from the beginning of veraison through to harvest. SDI reduced yield (t/ha) by up to 30 % in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, when applied at approximately 50 % of the control irrigation (ML/ha). Irrespective of the yield reductions, water use efficiency was improved between 40 - 50 % for the SDI-treated Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz, compared to the control. The lighter berries from SDI-treated vines tended to have increased pH and decreased titratable acid levels than the control. The SDI treatments applied at approximately 50 % of the control increased the concentration of total anthocyanins in Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz berries by 22 % and 15 % respectively. As less water was applied there was an increase in total malvidin concentration for both varieties, with less effect on delphinidin, peonidin, petunidin and cyanidin for Cabernet Sauvignon and peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and cyanidin for Shiraz. The increase in total anthocyanin and total phenolic concentrations for the SDI treatments than the control is attributed more to factors such as water deficit, canopy light penetration and/or changes in phenolic synthesis, than to differences in berry size (skin surface area to pulp volume ratio). Differences in grape anthocyanins and phenolics between the irrigation treatments were not the same as those measured in the wine. A decrease in berry weight did not alter the skin weight to berry weight ratios, and were therefore unlikely to be the cause of the altered composition of SDI wines. The increases in wine colour with SDI treatment {{may be the result of}} biochemical changes in the flavonoid pathway as a result of altered grapevine physiology responses to the SDI. Alternatively, the increases in red wine colour could possibly be due to a change in chemical properties of the anthocyanins to copigmented forms that may have influenced extractability efficiency during the winemaking or ageing process. This research showed that an SDI of approximately 50 % less water could be applied over one or two seasons with improvements in water use efficiency (t/ML) and berry composition compared to fully <b>irrigated</b> <b>vines.</b> Furthermore, for Cabernet Sauvignon exposed to 70 % and 52 % SDI there tended to be improvements in the overall wine composition and sensory ranking than the control. However from an economic perspective, net returns were not largely affected by using SDI based on the current grape prices. If water becomes a more highly valued resource and priced accordingly, then a larger increase in net return will result from SDI. Additionally, wineries would need to offer price incentives to produce lower yields that may result from adopting SDI. Overall, if the wine industry was faced with reductions in water allocations of 50 % or more in a particular season, then the adoption of SDI may be a feasible solution to maintaining winegrape production for the short-term. Through understanding the translation of grape composition into wine, these findings should be able to provide additional knowledge to the Australian grape and wine industry as to how SDI can be used to manipulate grape composition for the production of sustainable wine styles.

[ENG] The {{research of the}} current PhD Thesis deals with {{the evaluation of the}} agronomic and physiological responses of mature table grapes cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’ to partial root-zone drying (PRD) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with respect to other irrigation treatments that received different amounts of water applied. To this end, four irrigation treatments were established: (i) Control, receiving 110 % of crop standard evapotranspiration, ETC, throughout the whole growing season following the criteria by the commercial farm; (ii) RDI treatment, irrigated similar to Control levels during pre-veraison and at 50 % of the same during post-veraison (considered the non-critical period); (iii) PRD treatment, irrigated in a similar way to RDI but alternating (every 10 - 14 days) the dry and wet sides of the root-zone, depending on water deficit with respect to field capacity; and (iv) a null irrigation treatment (NI) which only received natural precipitation and occasional supplementary irrigation when the midday stem water potential (ψs) exceeded - 1. 2 MPa. To establish reference equations another full irrigation treatment (110 - 115 % ETc) was used. Furthermore, the results were extrapolated to a pot experiment {{in order to determine the}} physiological behavior of this cultivar, under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Chapter I analysed the yield response and chemical quality to long-term deficit irrigation (DI) strategies. No significant differences were found between PRD and RDI with respect to well-watered <b>vines</b> <b>irrigated</b> according to ETc, thus the application of a greater amount of water was not essential for plant behavior and berry development in ‘Crimson Seedless’ table grapes. Both PRD and RDI treatments supposed a water saving of 35 % without compromising total yield and its components. Only NI (which received 72 % less water than Control) led to a reduction in yield and the weight of clusters/berries compared with the other irrigated counterparts. Water use efficiency was also increased in all DI treatments as many water restrictions were assessed. Regarding chemical berry quality, all deficit irrigation treatments increased berry coloration (evaluated subjectively and objectively) which is considered the main issue of this variety for its marketability. Despite the fact that RDI and PRD received the same amount of annual water applied, PRD induced a greater accumulation of skin anthocyanins, resveratrol and antioxidant capacity. Although PRD did not show significant changes in yield response with respect to RDI, the fact that PRD increased the main bioactive compounds analysed that are beneficial to health, underlined the feasibility of the implementation of this strategy by growers. Chapter II focused on the long-term impact of DI strategies on physical berry quality, with particular attention to the berry firmness, since it is one of the most important characteristics in order to be marketed and for consumer acceptance. Moreover, the storage performance to ascertain the potential shelf-life of this cultivar was reported. RDI and PRD did not noticeably affect physical berry quality after cold storage while the subsequent shelf-life period tended to minimise the difference found at harvest or at the end of cold storage. Furthermore, NI treatment showed the worst sensory scores post-harvest and the most dehydrated clusters and lower berry size. In fact, sensory results were similar in RDI and PRD, which provided grapes that were more acceptable to consumers than well-irrigated vines, mainly due to lower stem browning and higher berry coloration. Remarkably, PRD registered the highest berry shattering, which was correlated with the lower concentration of ABAxylem induced by the grower’s strategy. Thus, the results obtained in Chapters I and II indicate that it is possible to decrease irrigation by applying RDI and PRD to ‘Crimson Seedless’ table grapes without adversely affecting yield and the physicochemical berry quality. The physiological response and vegetative growth to DI strategies were described in Chapter III. The analysis of the physiological fluxes (net CO 2 assimilation, ACO 2 and transpiration rate, E) and their characteristic attributes (stomatal conductance, gs) determined at leaf scale, under saturating-light conditions, showed a water stress response in accordance to the water stress severity imposed, regardless of irrigation strategy. Comparing post-veraison strategies, PRD induced higher plant and soil water deficit levels than RDI. Nevertheless, PRD neither significantly reduced gs nor increased ABAxylem against expectations. These results suggest a greater root development and root density from PRD with respect to RDI for water uptake. As expected, vegetative parameters were adversely affected by the severe deficit reached in NI, while the leaf area index was also modified by PRD. Principal components analysis (PCA) results showed that inter-annual differences detected between irrigation treatments were higher than those observed between phenological periods, especially when RDI and PRD were compared. Furthermore, maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) was the best plant-water status indicator to ascertain irrigation differences before veraison, whereas other conventional plant water status indicators (such as water potential and transpiration rate, E) might be considered for irrigation scheduling during post-veraison. Different reference lines appeared in Chapter IV from plant water status indicators such as MDS and ψs indicators were obtained during pre and post-veraison periods, respectively, for irrigation scheduling in well-irrigated table grapes cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’. In this sense, MDS and ψs showed better adjustment with mean temperature (Tm) during pre-veraison, while after veraison reference crop evapotranspiration (ET 0) and vapour pressure deficit can also be used. The correlation coefficients in MDS decrease during post-veraison due to changes of stem transpiration, the presence of sugar-demanding sinks and the accumulated ABAxylem. Besides this, under commercial conditions, water savings with respect to conventional scheduling based on ETc were achieved when the irrigation scheduling was done using SIMDS around unity (in pre-veraison) and maintaining ψs as a threshold value in well-watered vines (in post-veraison). Moreover, in this Chapter we also observed that some standard cultural practices such as girdling and the collocation of hail mesh to prevent torrential rainfalls might also modify vine water status. From a physiological point of view, the results obtained were extrapolated to a pot experiment in Chapter V. Table grapes showed a substantial loss of photosynthetic capacity as the season progressed both growing in the field (as shown in Chapter III) and in a pot experiment (Chapter V). Crimson Seedless displayed different responses to DI strategies, depending on the diurnal course. At predawn (t 1) and early morning (t 2), the cultivar showed near-anisohydric behavior, through a less effective stomatal control of drought, whereas at midday (t 3), the behavior was near-isohydric. In addition to this, water stress conditions induce avoidance mechanisms to drought, such as stomatal closure, partial defoliation and a reduction in leaf insertion angle. Analysis of the vegetative response does not indicate that PRD vines respond differently, or present a clear distinct adaptive mechanism to water stress with respect to RDI vines. In fact, pruning dry weight was only affected by severe water deficit (NI...|$|R
40|$|Growth, {{productivity}} and fruit quality of grapevines are {{closely linked to}} soil water availability. Withholding of water {{for any length of}} time results in slowed growth. If drought continues yield may be lost. Vines can be manipulated to stimulate early defence mechanisms by decreasing soil water availability. By using an irrigation technique, which allows for separate zones with different soil moisture status, it is possible to stimulate response mechanisms of the root system which are normally related to water stress. The difficulty of separating 'wet' and 'dry' zones was initially overcome by using split-root plants with root systems divided between two containers. Such experiments on split-root model plants resulted in the development of an irrigation technique termed partial rootzone drying (PRD). Results from irrigation experiments using PRD have shown that changes in stomatal conductance and shoot growth are some of the major components affected (Dry et al., 1996). The idea of using irrigation as a tool to manipulate stress responses in this way had its origin in the concept that root- derived abscisic acid (ABA) was important in determining stomatal conductance (Loveys, 1984). Later experiments on split-root plants have demonstrated that many effects of water stress can be explained in terms of transport of chemical signals from roots to shoots without changes in plant water status (Gowing et al., 1990). The necessary chemical signals are provided by the dry roots, and the wet roots prevent the development of deleterious water deficits. The general hypothesis tested during this study was that partial drying of the root system gives rise to a change in the supply of root-derived chemical signals which determine changes in grapevine physiology, thereby affecting fruit quality. Experiments were conducted on split-root vines (Vitis vinifera L. cvs. Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay) grown in pots of different sizes, on field-grown vines which had either their root system divided by a plastic membrane (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon on own roots or grafted on Ramsey rootstocks) or conventional vines with a non-divided root system (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Riesling) with a commercial PRD irrigation design. The irrigation treatments were vines receiving water on both sides (control) and PRD-treated vines, which only received water on one side at any time. The frequency of alternation of 'wet' and 'dry' sides was determined according to soil moisture and other influences such as rainfall and temperature. In most of the experiments the irrigation was alternated from one side to the other every 10 to 15 days. Chemical signals from roots: the role of ABA and cytokinins Studies on chemical signals have concentrated on ABA and cytokinins (CK). An improved stable isotope dilution protocol, which enables analysis of ABA and CK from the same tissue sample, was developed. Analysis of cytokinins focused on zeatin (Z), zeatin riboside (ZR), zeatin glucoside (ZG) and iso pentenyl adenine (iP). Roots are relatively inaccessible, particularly in field situations. To enable easier access to roots of field-grown vines, split-root vines were planted in a trench which was refilled with a sandy soil. This created a homogenous soil substrate and did not restrict root growth while still allowing access to roots under field conditions. Analyses of root samples of field-grown vines have shown that cytokinins and ABA may originate in roots and their concentrations can be substantially altered during an irrigation cycle. Alternating soil water conditions showed that [ABA] in roots on the 'dry' side was significantly higher compared with the 'wet' side. Due to a reduction in CK on the 'dry' side of PRD-treated vines, the ratio between ABA and CK was substantially changed during an irrigation cycle. The ABA levels in root tissue and in petiole xylem sap were negatively related to stomatal conductance. This further suggests that ABA, mostly synthesized on the 'dry' side of the root system, might be responsible for a decline in stomatal conductance. Furthermore, a higher pH of petiole xylem sap was observed in PRD-treated vines which may also contribute to the regulation of stomatal conductance. Studies on stomatal patchiness showed that non-uniform stomatal aperture occurred in field-grown vines under natural environmental conditions and was more abundant under PRD conditions. The degree of stomatal opening, determined by using a water infiltration technique, correlated with measurement of stomatal conductance. Exogenous application of a synthetic cytokinin (benzyl adenine) can override the possible ABA-mediated stomatal closure resulting from PRD treatment, providing further evidence for the in vivo role of these growth regulators in the control of stomatal conductance. The effect of benzyl adenine was transient, however, requiring repeated applications to sustain the reversal. In addition, CKs may also be important in influencing grapevine growth. Following several weeks of repeated spray applications with benzyl adenine, it was found that the development of lateral shoots in PRD-treated vines was enhanced compared to PRD-treated vines sprayed with water only. This supports the idea that the reduction in lateral shoot development seen in PRD-treated vines is due to a reduced production of CKs (Dry et al., 2000 a). By measuring shoot growth rate it was found that one common feature of PRD-treated vines, which were not sprayed with CK, was a reduction of lateral shoot growth. It can therefore be speculated that the reduction in lateral growth is related to a reduced delivery of cytokinins from the roots. Zeatin and zeatin riboside concentration in shoot tips and prompt buds/young lateral shoots were reduced by the PRD treatment providing further evidence in support of this hypothesis. Water movement from 'wet' to 'dry' roots Roots, being a primary sensor of soil drying, play an important role in long- and short-term responses to PRD. Using stable isotopes of water and heat-pulse sap flow sensors water movement was traced from wet to dry roots in response to PRD. The redistribution of water from roots grown in a soil of high water potential to roots growing in a soil of low water potential may be of significance with regard to the movement of chemical signals and the control of water balance of roots. Measurements of the relative water content (RWC) have shown a slower decline of RWC of the 'dry' roots of PRD vines relative to roots of vines which received no water, despite similar water content in soil surrounding those roots. The redistribution of water may help to sustain the response to PRD for longer periods possibly releasing chemical signals and to support the activity of fine roots in drying soil. Field <b>vines,</b> <b>irrigated</b> with PRD over several growing seasons, altered their root distribution relative to the control vines. PRD caused a greater concentration of fine roots to grow in deeper soil layers and this may contribute to a better water stress avoidance. The effect on root growth may be augmented by the water movement and by the large difference in ABA to cytokinin ratio, which are also known to alter root growth. PRD makes more efficient use of available water In experiments where both control and PRD-treated vines received the same amount of water many differences between the vines were demonstrated. Under conditions where water supply was adequate for both treatments, the stomatal conductance and growth of the PRD-treated vines was restricted as has been observed in many previous experiments. As total water input was reduced, however, the stomatal conductance of PRD-treated vines became greater than control vines, suggesting that the latter were experiencing a degree of water stress, whereas the PRD-treated vines were not. This may have been due to the greater depth of water penetration in the case of the PRD-treated vines, where water was applied to a smaller soil surface area. This distinction between PRD-treated and control vines, at very low water application rates, was also reflected in pruning weights and crop yields which were actually greater in PRD-treated vines. It was concluded that at low water application rates, the PRD-treated vines were more tolerant of water stress and made more efficient use of available water. Reduction in vigor opens the canopy. The initial aim of the research which led to the development of PRD was to achieve better control of undesirable, excessive shoot and foliage growth which, from a viticultural point of view, has many disadvantages. Grapevine shoot growth rate responds very sensitively to drying soil conditions. The irrigation strategy used in the PRD experiments maintained a reduction of both main shoot and lateral shoot growth. In response to PRD a decrease in shoot growth rate and leaf area was observed. Much of the reduction in canopy biomass was due to a reduced leaf area associated with lateral shoots, thus influencing the canopy structure. This was one major factor improving the light penetration inside the canopy. Control of vegetative vigour results in a better exposure of the bunch zone to light and, as a consequence, in improved grape quality. It is likely that changes in canopy density, as a result of PRD, is causing changes in fruit quality components. Anthocyanin pigments such as derivatives of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin and peonidin were more abundant in berries from PRD vines; by comparison the concentration of the major anthocyanin, malvidin, was reduced. When leaves were deliberately removed from more vigorous control vines, which improved bunch exposure, the differences in fruit composition were much reduced. This further supports the idea that a more open canopy, in response to PRD, improves fruit quality by affecting the canopy structure. Fruit quality consequently determines the quality, style and value of the finished wine. Wines from this study have been produced and data on wine quality from commercial wineries are also available. Sensory evaluations have demonstrated that high wine quality from PRD-treated vineyards can be achieved without any yield-depressing effects. This study has provided evidence to support the original hypothesis. The major findings were: a) Chemical signals, altered under PRD and mostly originating from roots, play an important role in the root to shoot communication in grapevines. b) The movement of water from 'wet' to 'dry' soil layers may help to sustain chemical signals as a response of grapevines to PRD and to support the activity of fine roots in drying soil. c) A reduction in vegetative growth, in particular of lateral shoots, was sustained using PRD and affected the canopy structure which in turn, due to a better light penetration into the canopy, improved the fruit quality. d) The reduction in irrigation water applied did not have a detrimental effect on grape yield and thus the efficiency of water use was improved. e) Application of relatively low irrigation rates showed that PRD-treated vines were more tolerant of water stress and made more efficient use of available water.
