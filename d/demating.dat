50|$|MHV {{connectors}} {{are presently}} {{considered by some}} as a safety hazard because of the possibility of high voltage on the exposed central pin when not plugged in, and because the ground connection is broken before the power connection when <b>demating.</b> SHV connectors are designed to prevent these hazards, and cannot be mated to BNC connectors.|$|E

40|$|On-orbit {{servicing}} of payloads is simplified when {{a spacecraft}} {{has been designed}} for serviceability. A key design criterion for a serviceable spaceraft is standardization of electrical connectors. This paper investigates the effects of extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) glove size, connector size, and connector type on usability of electrical connectors. An experiment was conducted exploring participants' ability to mate and <b>demate</b> connectors in an evacuated glovebox. Independent variables were two EMU glove-sizes, five connector size groups, and seven connector types. Significant differences in performance times and heart rate changes during mate and <b>demate</b> operations were found. Subjective assessments of connectors were collected from participants with a usability questionnaire. The data were used to derive design recommendations for a NASA-recommended EMU-compatible electrical connector...|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{widespread}} adoption, the connector {{does have}} problems. It {{is difficult to}} remove because it is {{held in place by}} friction instead of a latch, and some poorly constructed connectors may have one or more pins detach from the connector during mating or <b>demating.</b> There is also a tendency for the loosely inserted pins on the male connector to skew out of alignment. The female sockets can spread, making the connection imperfect and subject to arcing. Standard practice is to check for any sign of blackening or browning on the white plastic shell, which would indicate the need to replace the arcing connector. In extreme cases the whole connector can melt due to the heat from arcing.|$|E

Following this the craft performed a rendezvous to a standoff, where decommissioning took place. The NEXTSat spacecraft was deactivated on 21 July, when its computers were turned off, and solar panels pointed away from the Sun.

40|$|Abstract. For {{sustainable}} Exploration Missions {{the need}} exists to assemble systems-of-systems in space, on the Moon or on other planetary surfaces. To fulfill this need new and innovative system architectures {{must be developed}} to be modularized and launched with the present lift capability of existing rocket technology. To enable long duration missions with minimal redundancy and mass, system software and hardware must be reconfigurable. This will enable increased functionality and multiple use of launched assets while providing the capability to quickly overcome components failures. Additional required capability includes the ability to dynamically <b>demate</b> and reassemble individual system elements during a mission in order to recover from failed hardware or to adapt to changes in mission requirements. To meet the Space Exploration goals of Interoperability and Reconfigurability, many challenges must be addressed to transform the traditional static avionics architectures into architectures with dynamic capabilities. The objective {{of this paper is}} to introduce concepts associated with reconfigurable computer systems; to review the various needs and challenges associated with reconfigurable avionics space systems; to provide an operational example that illustrates the application to both the Crew Exploration Vehicle and a collection of “Habot–like ” mobile surface elements; to summarize the approaches that address key challenges to the acceptance of a Flexible, Intelligent, Modular, Affordable and Reconfigurable avionics space system...|$|R

To fulfill this need new and innovative system architecture is needed {{that can be}} satisfied with the present lift capability of existing rocket technology without the added cost of developing a new heavy lift vehicle. To enable ultra-long life missions with minimum redundancy and lighter mass the need exists to develop system soft,i,are and hardware reconfigurability, which enables increasing functionality and multiple use of launched assets {{while at the same time}} overcoming any components failures. Also the need exists to develop the ability to dynamically <b>demate</b> and reassemble individual system elements during a mission in order to work around failed hardware or changed mission requirements.

40|$|On {{the sixth}} flight {{day of the}} STS- 109 mission, the crewmembers of the Columbia Orbiter (Commander Scott Altman, Pilot Duane Carey, Payload Commander John Grunsfeld, and Mission Specialists Nancy Currie, James Newman, Richard Linnehan, and Michael Massimino) are shown in {{selected}} footage of their servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The third of five extravehicular activities (EVA) is performed in which Linnehan and Grunsfeld replaced the HST's Power Control Unit (PCU). The astronauts' egress from the Orbiter was delayed after water was found in Grunsfeld's suit. The removal of the old unit was particularly difficult, given the difficulty of <b>demating</b> the PCU's 36 connectors encumbered by the heavy gloves of the astronaut's suit. During this space walk, the HST was powered down to a completely dormant state {{for the first time}} since its launch in 1990.

40|$|Experience {{from several}} recent {{spacecraft}} development programs, such as Space Station Freedom (SSF) and the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) {{has shown the}} need for factoring proximity operations considerations into the vehicle design process. Proximity operations, those orbital maneuvers and procedures which involve operation {{of two or more}} spacecraft at ranges of less than one nautical mile, are essential to the construction, servicing, and operation of complex spacecraft. Typical proximity operations considerations which drive spacecraft design may be broken into two broad categories; flight profile characteristics and concerns, and use of various spacecraft systems during proximity operations. Proximity operations flight profile concerns include the following: (1) relative approach/separation line; (2) relative orientation of the vehicles; (3) relative translational and rotational rates; (4) vehicle interaction, in the form of thruster plume impingement, mating or <b>demating</b> operations, or uncontrolled contact/collision; and (5) active vehicle piloting. Spacecraft systems used during proximity operations include the following: (1) sensors, such as radar, laser ranging devices, or optical ranging systems; (2) effector hardware, such as thrusters; (3) flight control software; and (4) mating hardware, needed for docking or berthing operations. A discussion of how these factors affect vehicle design follows, addressing both active and passive/cooperative vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and <b>demate</b> operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector jaws grip the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism. A cross-link mechanism was used to complete this task, while ensuring smooth operation...|$|R
40|$|During system {{level testing}} {{intermittent}} and permanent open circuit failures of mated, crimp removable, electrical contact pairs were experienced. The {{root cause of}} the failures {{was determined to be}} low (but not zero) contact forces applied by the socket contact tines against the engaging pin. The low contact force reduces the effectiveness of the wiping action of the socket tines against the pin. The observed failure mode may be produced when insufficient wiping during mate, <b>demate</b> and small relative movement in use allows for the accumulation of debris or insulating films that electrically separate the contact pair. The investigation identified at least three manufacturing process control problems associated with the socket contacts that enabled shipment of contacts susceptible to developing low contact forces: (1) Improper heat treatment of the socket tines resulting in plastic rather than elastic behavior; (2) Overly thinned socket tines at their base resulting in reduced pin retention forces; (3) insufficient screening tests to identify parts susceptible to the aforementioned failure mechanisms. The results from an extensive screening program of socket contacts utilizing the industry standard contact separation force test procedures are described herein. The investigation shows this method to be capable of identifying initially weak sockets. However, sockets whose contact retention forces may degrade during use may not be screened out by pin retention testing alone. Further investigations are required to correlate low contact retention forces with increased electrical contact resistance in the presence of insulating films that may accumulate in the use environment...|$|R
50|$|The launch {{occurred}} on 15 November 1990, 18:48:13 EST. It was originally scheduled for July 1990, however, a liquid hydrogen leak found on Columbia during the STS-35 countdown prompted three precautionary tanking tests on Atlantis at the pad on 29, 13 June July - 25 July 1990. Tests confirmed the hydrogen fuel leak on the external tank {{side of the}} external tank/orbiter 432 mm quick disconnect umbilical. This could not be repaired at the pad and Atlantis was rolled back to the VAB on 9 August, <b>demated,</b> then transferred to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). During rollback, the vehicle remained parked outside the VAB for about a day while the Columbia/STS-35 stack {{was transferred to the}} pad for launch. While outside, Atlantis suffered minor hail damage to its tiles during a thunderstorm. After repairs were made in the OPF, Atlantis was transferred to the VAB for mating on 2 October. During hoisting operations, the platform beam that was to have been removed from the orbiter's aft compartment fell and caused minor damage, which was repaired. The vehicle rolled out to Pad A on 12 October 1990. The fourth mini-tanking test was performed on 24 October, with no excessive hydrogen or oxygen leakage detected. During the Flight Readiness Review, the launch date was set for 9 November 1990. The launch was reset for 15 November due to payload problems. Liftoff occurred during a classified launch window lying within a launch period extending from 18:30 to 22:30 EST on 15 November.|$|R
