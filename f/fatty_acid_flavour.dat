Thickening and gelling agents, <b>flavour</b> enhancers, polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>flavour</b> compounds, vitamins, essential amino acids, and acidulants are some examples of such ingredients. This paper will provide an update on the current worldwide situation for four different fungal reds: (i) carotenoid lycopene (simple compound, complex current status); (ii) molecular biology on Monascus to avoid mycotoxin and cholesterol-lowering substance in pigmented extracts; (iii) newcomers with azaphilone-producing fungi such as Talaromyces atroroseus, Penicillium purpurogenum, and Talaromyces albobiverticillius; and (iv) anthraquinones as a possible alternative to the insect-sourced carmine. The future of Monascus in Europe and the USA is just around the corner, and markets will appear as soon as the citrinin issue has been solved, {{with the help of the}} current better knowledge of full genomes from industrial strains. Fungi bring a new class of pigments to the food industry, as azaphilones are not present in plants. These azaphilone-producing strains should now be thoroughly studied through liquid fermentation of Penicillium/Talaromyces strains, with optimized scale-up. A fungal alternative to carmine insect anthraquinone is further away from the market, however, due to the particular stability of this vibrant red in foods; research efforts should be intensified...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} product {{development}} to increase sheepmeat liking for consumers unhabituated to its characteristic flavour. The development {{has centered on}} a cured, fermented sausage, traditionally flavoured with garlic and rosemary, aiming to suppress the intrinsic species flavour (from branched chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and <b>flavours</b> (mainly skatole) from New Zealand’s pastoral diets. However, appearance and texture are also important for liking. Therefore, the colour and textural properties of cured, fermented sheepmeat sausage were {{compared with those of}} beef and pork equivalents. The problem of between-animal variation was overcome by comparing replicates made from meats bought on seven dates from different butchers. During fermentation over four days, samples were tested for growth of lactic acid bacteria, pH decrease, and colour and texture changes. There {{were no significant differences between}} the species. Subsequently, the flavour of fermented beef sausage was assessed by consumers where the fat was pre-treated (or not as controls) with the ovine-characterising branched chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (BCFAs), 4 -methyloctanoic acid and 4 -methylnonanoic acid, as well as with the pastoral flavour- characterising compound, skatole. Beef has no BCFAs and low concentrations of skatole, and was thus ‘turned into sheepmeat’ by addition of BCFAs and skatole. The sausage mixture was in eight treatments that were combinations of cured vs. non-cured, flavoured vs. non-flavoured, added BCFAs/skatole vs. non-added. For sensory evaluation, 60 consumers tasted samples in a randomized design and completed a 9 -point liking-score scale for each. Neither curing nor flavouring affected the liking of sausage treatments with or without added BCFAs/skatole. However, combined curing and flavouring significantly enhanced the liking of the added BCFAs/skatole treatment. Thus, appearance and texture of fermented sheepmeat were the same as for other species; species and pastoral flavours in sheepmeat may be more acceptable to unhabituated consumers where fermented sausage is flavoured with at least traditional European flavours...|$|R
40|$|A {{period of}} purging before {{harvesting}} is {{common practice in}} intensive aquaculture to eliminate any possible off flavours from the fish. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the biometrical, nutritional and sensory changes in intensively farmed Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii) after 0, 2 and 4 weeks of purging. After the main biometric parameters were recorded, fish were analysed for proximate, <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition and <b>flavour</b> volatile compounds. A consumer preference test (triangle test) was also conducted to identify sensorial differences that may affect the consumer acceptability of the product. Fish purged for 2 and 4 weeks had a significant weight loss of 4. 1 % and 9. 1 %, respectively, compared to unpurged fish, whilst perivisceral fat content did not change. The concentration of saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and highly unsaturated (HUFA) <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were not significantly affected by purging time, while polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (PUFA), n − 3 and n − 3 HUFA were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in purged fish compared to unpurged fish.

The overall significance of this study had been its revelation that freshwater fish are good source of omega- 6 essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The high percent of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in freshwater fish gives them an advantage in curing processing...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} are major sources of fat in the human diet, but there are few detailed reports on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of retail milk, trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in particular, and how these change throughout the year. Semi-skimmed milk was collected monthly for one year from five supermarkets and analysed for <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition. Relative to winter, milk sold in the summer contained lower total saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (SFA; 67 vs 72 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and higher cis-monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (MUFA; 23 vs 21 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> and total trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (6. 5 vs 4. 5 g/ 100 g <b>fatty</b> <b>acids)</b> concentrations. Concentrations of most trans- 18 : 1 and - 18 : 2 isomers also exhibited seasonal variation. Results were applied to national dietary intakes, and indicated that monthly variation in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of milk available at retail has limited influence on total dietary <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> consumption by UK adults...|$|R
40|$|Exogenously {{supplied}} long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{have been}} shown to markedly alleviate the inhibition of phototrophic growth of cultures of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides caused by the antibiotic cerulenin. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated C 18 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were most effective in relieving growth inhibition mediated by cerulenin. Medium supplementation with saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (C 14 to C 18) failed to influence the inhibitory effect of cerulenin. The addition of mixtures of unsaturated and saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> to the growth medium did not enhance the growth of cerulenin-inhibited cultures above that obtained with individual unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as supplements. Resolution and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> analysis of the extractable lipids of R. sphaeroides revealed that exogenously supplied <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were directly incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Cells treated with cerulenin displayed an enrichment in their percentage of total saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> irrespective of the presence of exogenous <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Cerulenin produced comparable inhibitions of the rates of both <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and phospholipid synthesis and was further found to preferentially inhibit unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis...|$|R
50|$|The LCAD enzyme catalyzes most of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> beta-oxidation {{by forming}} a C2-C3 trans-double bond in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> LCAD works on {{long-chain}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> typically between C12 and C16-acylCoA. LCAD {{is essential for}} oxidizing unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> such as oleic acid, but seems redundant in the oxidation of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|R
40|$|Buffalo milk is the world’s {{second most}} widely pro- duced milk, and {{increasing}} attention {{is being paid}} to its composition, particularly the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile. The ob- jectives {{of the present study}} were (1) to characterize the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of Mediterranean buffalo milk, and (2) to investigate potential sources of variation in the buffalo milk <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> profile. We determined the profile of 69 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> traits in 272 individual samples of Mediterranean buffalo milk using gas chromatogra- phy. In total, 51 individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified: 24 saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> 13 monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and 14 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The ma- jor individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in buffalo milk were in the order 16 : 0, 18 : 1 cis- 9, 14 : 0, and 18 : 0. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were the predominant fraction in buffalo milk fat (70. 49...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition for fats {{differs from that}} of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> dietary cholesterol, and trans <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> than an unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule is broken down and categorized {{based on the number of}} carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Palmitic acid is a commonly studied example of the saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> molecule.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fish (Labeo coubie, Citharinus citharus, Hyperopisus bebe, Mormyrops anguilloides, Mormyrus rume, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Clarias gariepinus, Clarias anguillaris, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Clariheterobranchus, Lates niloticus and Hydrocynus forskalii) were studied for their oil <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> composition. Identification and {{quantitative}} measurement of fish oils <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. GC-MS was applied on <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> methyl esters. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified in order of their retention time. Saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (SFA), monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (MUFA), polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (PUFA) formed {{a large proportion of}} total lipids. Multi-methyl branched, methyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contributed a smaller proportion. It can be concluded that these fish oils are excellent sources of essential <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> omega- 6 and omega- 9...|$|R
