6000|$|MORNING OF AUGUST 12th, Friedrich has, in his bad lodging at Seichau, laid a {{new plan}} of route: [...] "Towards Schweidnitz let it be; round by Pombsen and the southeast, by the Hill-roads, make a sweep flankward of the enemy!"--and has people out reconnoitring the Hill-roads. Hears, however, about 8 o'clock, That Austrians in {{strength}} are coming between us and Goldberg! [...] "Intending to enclose us in this bad pot of a Seichau; no crossing of the Katzbach, or other retreat to be left us at all?" [...] Friedrich strikes his tents; ranks himself; is speedily in readiness for dispute of such extremity;--sends out new patrols, however, to ascertain. [...] "Austrians in strength" [...] there are NOT on the side indicated;--whereupon he draws in again. But, on the other hand, the Hill-roads are reported absolutely impassable for baggage; Pombsen an impossibility, as the other places have been. So Friedrich sits down again in Seichau to consider; does not stir all day. To Mitchell's horror, who, [...] "with great labor," [...] burns all the legationary ciphers and papers ("impossible to save the baggage if we be attacked in this <b>hollow</b> <b>pot</b> of a camp"), and feels much relieved on finishing. [Mitchell, ii. 144; Tempelhof, iv. 144.] ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{system also}} had the {{advantage}} of quick construction; Michelin House took only 5 months to build. The original floors were constructed using <b>hollow</b> <b>pot</b> tiles. This flooring system as well as being highly durable also offered very good fireproofing qualities.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a temple made of Roman {{concrete}} in the 1st century BC is the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy. The concrete was made of nothing more than rubble and mortar. It was cheap and very easy to produce and required relatively unskilled labour to use, enabling the Romans to build on an unprecedented scale. They not only used it for walls but also to form arches, barrel vaults and domes, which they built over huge spans. The Romans developed systems of <b>hollow</b> <b>pots</b> for making their domes and sophisticated heating and ventilation systems for their thermal baths[...]|$|R
50|$|Strutt {{had used}} {{cast-iron}} for bridges in Derby, and applied it {{to building a}} calico mill in Derby, the Warehouse at Milford (pulled down in 1964 to make a car park), and then the new West Mill, built in 1795 at Belper. Tile and gypsum plaster floors were supported on brickwork arches supported on cast iron columns. The timber beams were encased in thin sheet iron. To reduce weight, the upper floors were supported on <b>hollow</b> earthenware <b>pots</b> encased in plaster.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When {{the plague}} {{is so hot}} in a village that the {{neighbours}} shut the roads against 'em, people set a <b>hollowed</b> stone, <b>pot,</b> or pan, where such as would purchase victual from outside may lay money and the paper of their wants, and depart. Those that would sell come later--what will a man not do for gain?---snatch the money forth, and leave in exchange such goods as their conscience reckons fair value. I saw a silver groat in the water, and the man's list of what he would buy was rain-pulped in his wet hand.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that Sutton Hoo was occupied during the Neolithic period, [...] 3000 BCE, when woodland in the area was cleared by agriculturalists. They dug small pits that contained flint-tempered earthenware pots. Several pits were near to hollows where large trees had been uprooted: the Neolithic farmers may have associated the <b>hollows</b> with the <b>pots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} {{facilities that}} were destroyed were the Fiber Arts Studio, a ropes course area, an equipment shed, an aqueduct, <b>Pot</b> <b>Hollow,</b> Short House, and Pole Barn. Activities in those facilities were temporarily moved to other facilities {{on the property}} in order to await possible reconstruction. Some parts of the Box Canyon trail {{as well as the}} entire Matrimonial Mesa trail at the ranch were also inaccessible due to the aftermath of the flood. Some victims received counseling due to posttraumatic stress.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{construction}} method employed for constructing suspended slabs in buildings tend to impact significantly on the delivery time of building project. Thus, {{this study aims}} at assessing the impact of various construction methods on duration for constructing hollow and solid floor slabs in buildings in Lagos State, Nigeria. The research design {{for this study was}} a survey design approach and the populations of the study were professionals involved in construction projects; Architects, Civil Engineers, Builders, Quantity Surveyors, Building Services Consultant and Contractors. These are the major participants in the construction industry in Lagos State, Nigeria. The analysis is based on 46 (forty-six) returned questionnaires out of the 60 (Sixty) questionnaires administered. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics tools such as frequency, percentage mean ranking while the hypothesis were tested with a paired sample t-test tool. It was found that the systems or methods of slab construction well known to the respondents are cast in situ, precast and semi-precast. The Cast in-situ beam and slab construction ranked as the most frequently adopted method followed by flat slab, <b>hollow</b> clay <b>pot</b> and waffle slab construction. In terms of construction time, placing reinforcement and construction of formwork takes more time than other processes in solid slab construction while in construction of reinforced cast in situ concrete hollow slab; formwork construction, placing hollow bricks or blocks or moulds on formwork and curing concrete takes more time than the other processes involved. The studyâ€™s major recommendation is that, adequate and careful analysis should be conducted before taking a decision on the choice of floor system been adopted for any project...|$|R
