25|$|The {{next day}} {{he was taken to}} Little Rock to face Brig. Gen. John Davidson, who was {{commanding}} the Union occupation forces in Gen. Frederick Steele's absence. A telegraph operator translated the Morse code, which provided precise locations and strengths of Union troops. David was formally charged as a spy and taken to the military prison (on the site of the present Arkansas State Capitol building). Dodd was interrogated for two days by Union officers who tried to discover the source of the information. On the third day, under personal orders from Gen. Steele, Mary Dodge and her father were escorted under armed guard to a Union gunboat on the Arkansas River and transported to Vermont, where Mary was kept {{until the end of the}} war. This suggests that Steele had discovered that Mary Dodge was involved, and that he would not be able to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> 16-year-old girl.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel located {{immediately}} {{behind the}} Eastern Pavilion, created in 1742-48 and originally rising through two floors. The room {{was divided into}} two floors in 1929 when the new school chapel was built, all the timber panelling being reused in the new chapel. Only the plaster ceiling decoration survives, this consists of octagons, crosses and hexagons. The elaborate carved wood panelling of cedarwood came from a house in Cornwall also called Stowe. It had been carved by Michael Chuke a pupil of Grinling Gibbons. The most elaborate pieces of carving were the gallery on the south side, the octagonal pulpit dated 1707 and the elaborate reredos the reached nearly the full height of the room, the lower half having two Corinthian columns flanking the altar above which used to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> copy of Rubens's painting of 'Holy Lamb'.

25|$|One {{important}} {{tradition is}} Day of the Dead, celebrated throughout the borough but San Andrés Mixquic’s is particularly well known, attracting {{thousands of visitors}} from Mexico and abroad. The celebration generally lasts three days from October 31 to November 1 each day focusing on different groups, children, adults and saints. One local tradition related to the day is to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> paper lantern often {{in the form of}} a star at the entrance to home as a way to greet the return of the souls of the dead. The Fiestas del Santo Jubileo is a custom observed on different days in the communities of the borough. It consists of a mass and exhibition of the Host on the main altar of the church for 40 hours, surrounded by flowers, sawdust carpets, live music, dances and fireworks. Carnival is important in San Francisco Tlaltenco and Santiago Zapotitlán, where dancers generally are chinelos and those in charro suits. These carnivals begin on the fourth Sunday of Lent. The tradition in San Francisco Tlaltenco goes back to the end of the 19th century. A reenactment of Palm Sunday has been held each year at San Pedro Tláhuac for over eighty years, with the procession winding its way through eight different neighborhoods. San Pedro Tláhuac is also the site of the Regional Fair of Tláhuac. It was first organized in 1956, with the goal so attracting tourism and encouraging youth to maintain traditions. It begins with a procession of the image of the patron saint, the Apostle Peter, in decorated trajinera boats in the chinampa areas of Lago de los Reyes Aztecas. Other events include the selection of a fair queen, conferences, cultural events, concerts, dances, fireworks and more, with proceeds going to the restoration of the San Pedro Apostal Church.|$|E

500|$|The law in Wales at {{that time}} {{permitted}} condemned men to atone for their crimes by making a payment to their victims. Cragh's friends and family rallied round to offer 100 cows to deBriouze for his release, but the offer was refused. The substantial scale of the proposed compensation indicates that Cragh was an important man, although some witnesses described him as a thief rather than a rebel. Historian Jussi Hanska has suggested that de Briouze's refusal to accept the offer strengthens the case for Cragh being a rebel, {{as there is no}} other convincing reason to explain why he should have opted to [...] "decline good income just to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> thief".|$|E
500|$|Following the British surrender, Hazen and {{his unit}} were given {{prisoner}} guard duty at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. [...] While on this duty, a misstep by Hazen caused a minor diplomatic incident, {{known as the}} [...] "Asgill Affair". [...] The British accused an American soldier of spying, and were threatening to hang him. [...] George Washington threatened to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> British soldier if this happened, and instructed Hazen to choose an officer whose rank {{was similar to that}} of the accused American. [...] The man he chose by lot, Charles Asgill, should have been ineligible for selection due to the terms of the Yorktown surrender. [...] The accused American was eventually acquitted, but Asgill's plight drew the attention of Marie Antoinette; Washington received a letter from the French foreign minister asking for a pardon.|$|E

500|$|On an {{edition of}} ITV's The South Bank Show in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby [...] "embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression... {{and you thought}} that here's a man whom {{whatever}} is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that". H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E
500|$|After Jackson's {{death in}} June 2009, Letitia James, of the New York City Council, {{began trying to}} {{convince}} the agency to rename or co-name the Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets station or to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> plaque at the station in Jackson's honor. However, her request was denied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in September 2009. James commented, [...] "Having Michael Jackson visit and moonwalk at this station was a huge deal not only for Brooklyn, but all of New York in the '80s [...] And renaming this station in his honor would put it on the map and help ensure that people don't forget." [...] A source from the MTA commented that no subway stations in the MTA system are named or co-named after individuals, mostly because it could confuse riders. The MTA also declined to put a plaque in the station, due to MTA guidelines banning such a thing.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Duane Barry's abduction, they had a [...] "film run out" [...] which, {{according}} to Carter, gave the scene a [...] "very eerie effect".

The visual effects' crew had to <b>hang</b> <b>a</b> [...] "giant light" [...] over the house where Barry was being abducted. It took the course of 45 minutes to shoot the scene. According to Carter, much teamwork was required to film that particular scene. As Carter puts it, he was actually forced to stay [...] "behind the camera" [...] to see the end results. For the experiments, Railsback was put in a plaster model of his back as he was lifted by a hydraulic device, and had water squirted on his mouth for the dental drill.|$|E
