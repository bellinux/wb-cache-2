5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious need of repair and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E

25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its local {{significance}} in the areas of industry and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E

ABC's daytime schedule was full at the time, and the earliest they could have a spot open on the schedule would be December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before Edge would air its first episode on ABC and the network did not want to do that. Instead, a compromise was struck. CBS would keep The Edge of Night on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a place for it, which <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> they cancelled You Don't Say! in November 1975, the expansion and network change would take place.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{experiments}} which {{have been shown to}} increase the maximum life span of laboratory animals, thereby achieving life extension. A few experimental methods such as replacing hormones to youthful levels have had considerable success in partially rejuvenating laboratory animals and humans. A recent experiment involved breeding genetically manipulated mice that lacked an enzyme called telomerase, causing the mice to age prematurely and suffer ailments. When the mice were given injections to reactivate the enzyme, it repaired the damaged tissues and reversed the signs of aging. There are at least eight important hormones that decline with age: 1. human growth hormone (HGH); 2. the sexual hormones: testosterone or oestrogen/progesterone; 3. erythropoietin (EPO); 4. insulin; 5. DHEA; 6. melatonin; 7. thyroid; 8. pregnenolone. In theory, if all or some of these hormones are replaced, the body will respond to them as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was younger, thus repairing and restoring many body functions. In line with this, recent experiments show that heterochronic parabiosis, i.e. connecting the circulatory systems of young and old animal, leads to the rejuvenation of the old animal, including restoration of proper stem cell function. Similar experiments show that grafting old muscles into young hosts leads to their complete restoration, whereas grafting young muscles into old hosts does not. These experiments show that aging is mediated by systemic environment, rather than being an intrinsic cell property. Clinical trials based on transfusion of young blood were scheduled to begin in 2014.|$|E
500|$|The New Melones debate {{influenced}} the eventual protection {{of a number}} of other northern California rivers (the Eel, Klamath and others) under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System starting in 1980. It considerably changed the California state government's approach to water resources development, switching focus from massive dam projects to conservation and policy improvements. In 1982, the same year that New Melones Lake filled, the Reclamation Reform Act set more stringent standards for vetting federal Reclamation projects, essentially [...] "distancing federal policy from the 'dams-everywhere' approach of the past." [...] However, the relative lack of new storage has severely strained California's water system, which now serves 15 million more people than <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> New Melones Dam was completed in 1979.|$|E

500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{authored}} {{the majority}} opinion. He cited {{a line of}} cases dating {{back as far as}} 1886 to argue that a physical intrusion, or trespass, into a constitutionally-protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis, historically, for determining whether a [...] "search" [...] had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. [...] Scalia conceded that in the years following Katz v. United States (1967) – in which electronic eavesdropping on a public telephone booth was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights, and towards an approach based on a person's [...] "expectation of privacy". However, he cited a number of post-Katz cases including Alderman v. United States and Soldal v. Cook County to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court. In response to criticisms within Alito's concurrence, Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide, at a minimum, the level of protection as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was adopted. [...] Furthermore, a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy, which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass.|$|E

So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had."

Upon its 25th anniversary, music critic and scholar Joseph Vogel observed that when viewed [...] "as a complete artistic statement, Rhythm Nation 1814 was a stunning achievement. It married the pleasures of pop with the street energy and edge of hip-hop." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly asserted the record [...] "has barely aged—it sounds as rich and vital as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> it was first released, and stylistically as contemporary as anything on the Billboard charts." [...] Anderson also underscores that it pioneered several musical trends, citing records by pop and R artists including Rihanna, Pink, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, Gwen Stefani, The Weeknd, Lady Gaga, Jhené Aiko, Miguel, Christina Aguilera, FKA Twigs, and Tinashe that have exhibited similarities to the [...] "landmark" [...] album. Its single for [...] "Alright" [...] featuring Heavy D made Jackson the first pop artist to team with a rapper, [...] "setting the trend for future pop and hip-hop collaborations." [...] Additionally, [...] "Black Cat" [...] set a precedent for female pop stars segueing into glam metal. The album notably influenced Michael Jackson's Dangerous (1991) and [...] (1995), the latter of which features the sibling's duet [...] "Scream", produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Its impact also extends to indie and alternative rock music, with School of Seven Bells, A Sunny Day in Glasgow, and Alexis Krauss of Sleigh Bells citing the album as an influence in their work. MTV's Brenna Ehrlich remarked: [...] "From Beyoncé... to Britney Spears to Robyn to Sleigh Bells, the influence of Jackson's game-changer of a record is still rippling through the radio waves (or SoundCloud waves) today." ...|$|E
