5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy <b>disturbs</b> killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tree {{condition}} {{and characteristics of}} natural regeneration of tree species was assessed in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Sampling was done in anthropogenically undisturbed, lightly <b>disturbed,</b> heavily <b>disturbed</b> and completely <b>disturbed</b> forest types. Nested plots measuring 25 x 30 m were established to assess tree size classes from seedlings (diameter 15 cm). Higher stem densities were found in undisturbed and lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest types compared to heavily or completely <b>disturbed</b> types. Tree species richness and diversity were highest in lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest. Acacia mearnsii, an introduced tree species in Uganda, was recorded in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was highest in <b>disturbed</b> sites while regeneration from seeds was highest in undisturbed sites. High intensity human disturbance was associated with fewer signs of mammal damage. Damage to trees by physical agents and climber abundance increased with intensity of disturbance except in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. High intensity human disturbance adversely affected tree species abundance, diversity and regeneration and increased the incidence of damage to trees. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was most important in heavily <b>disturbed</b> sites. Intensity of disturbance and slope influenced th...|$|R

Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this <b>disturbs</b> the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|Because it cannot {{compete with}} {{established}} plants, great mullein {{is no longer}} considered a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also <b>disturbs</b> the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can {{be very difficult to}} completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal <b>disturbs</b> their nest.|$|E
5|$|Most Iridomyrmex {{species are}} {{aggressive}} ants that will attack anything which attacks or <b>disturbs</b> their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member {{species of the}} I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{disturbance}} were explored for red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Scottish Highlands, {{by studying the}} distribution, behaviour and diet composition of deer in areas that were <b>disturbed</b> or less <b>disturbed</b> by human recreation, in different habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) and {{at different times of}} year.   The human-caused predation risk hypothesis states that there are similarities between the responses elicited by wild animals towards human recreational disturbance and predation.   This hypothesis was tested by comparing behaviour during the recreation season (spring and summer) and the hunting season (autumn and winter). Deer densities were lower in <b>disturbed</b> areas than less <b>disturbed</b> areas throughout the year, although {{there was no difference in}} relative habitat use as a result of disturbance. Habitat selection was primarily influenced by season, with grasslands having higher deer densities during the spring and summer and heather moorlands having higher densities during the winter. Behaviour was monitored using scan sampling of groups.   The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher, resulting in a smaller number of deer feeding in <b>disturbed</b> than less <b>disturbed</b> areas during the recreational season.   Vigilance was higher in <b>disturbed</b> grassland and heather moorland than undisturbed woodland, while behaviour was similar in <b>disturbed</b> woodland and the less <b>disturbed</b> habitats.   In <b>disturbed</b> heather and woodland and in all less <b>disturbed</b> habitats, the majority of animals were standing while vigilant, whilst in <b>disturbed</b> grassland, lying was the main mode of vigilance.   Deer were more likely to be close together when vigilance levels were high.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{drifting}} accuracy of aerostatic bearings, the manufacturing errors effects on <b>disturbing</b> torque of aerostatic bearings is studied by using the finite element method. The finite element mathematic model of the major influence factors of <b>disturbing</b> torque is established. Then, the finite element equation in the gas film domain is solved and the <b>disturbing</b> torque {{in the presence of}} <b>disturbing</b> factors is calculated. The research focuses on elliptical error and prismatic error of journal and incline error of throttle slit. The setting angle of journal, incline position angle of throttle slit and radial eccentricity ratio which affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque is also studied. The results show that roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque significantly, that is the greater roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit the greater <b>disturbing</b> torque. <b>Disturbing</b> torque is periodic function of setting angle of journal and incline position angle of throttle slit. Radial eccentricity ratio affects the <b>disturbing</b> torque, and there is specific radial eccentricity ratio makes <b>disturbing</b> torque to be extreme point or zero point. In the research, the theoretical <b>disturbing</b> torque value is compared with the experimental value of a certain aerostatic bearing, find that they are on the whole accordant with each other and then prove that the finite element model and the method use to solve the problem is correct. The research is of great significance for designing, manufacturing and assembling aerostatic bearings and for performance prediction of aerostatic bearings...|$|R
