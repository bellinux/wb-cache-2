25|$|A {{total of}} 8.0 million {{citizens}} from European countries {{outside of the}} <b>EU-27</b> were residing in the EU {{at the beginning of}} 2012; among these more than half were citizens of Turkey, Albania or Ukraine. The next biggest group was from Africa (24.5%), followed by Asia (22.0%), the Americas (14.2%) and Oceania (0.8%). Romanians (living in another EU Member State) and Turkish citizens made up the biggest groups of non-nationals living in the <b>EU-27</b> in 2012. There were 2.4 million Romanian citizens living outside of Romania within the <b>EU-27</b> and 2.3 million Turkish citizens living in the EU-27; each of these two groups of people accounted for 7.0% of all foreigners living in the <b>EU-27</b> in 2012.

25|$|According to IEA {{data from}} 1990 to 2008, the average energy use per person {{increased}} 10% while world population increased 27%. Regional energy use also grew from 1990 to 2008: the Middle East increased by 170%, China by 146%, India by 91%, Africa by 70%, Latin America by 66%, the USA by 20%, the <b>EU-27</b> block by 7%, and world overall grew by 39%.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Brazil, India, European Union, China, Thailand, and United States {{were the}} major sugar-producing {{countries}} in the world. Brazil produced about 40 million tonnes of table sugar in 2013, while India produced 25 million, <b>EU-27</b> countries 16 million, China 14 million, Thailand about 10 million, and United States over 7 million. The country rankings for table sugar production change with each year's sugarcane crop harvest and as new sugar production plants are commissioned worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Figures {{released}} by Eurostat in 2009 {{confirmed that the}} Eurozone had gone into recession in 2008. It impacted much of the region. In 2010, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed concerning some countries in Europe, especially Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. As a result, measures were taken, especially for Greece, by the leading countries of the Eurozone. The <b>EU-27</b> unemployment rate was 10.3% in 2012. For those aged 15–24 it was 22.4%.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Ireland {{is a modern}} {{knowledge}} economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries and dependent on trade, industry and investment. In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland is ranked {{as one of the}} wealthiest countries in the OECD and the <b>EU-27</b> at 5th in the OECD-28 rankings as of 2008. In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income, Ireland ranks only slightly above the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings. GDP (national output) is significantly greater than GNP (national income) due to the repatriation of profits and royalty payments by multinational firms based in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Cornwall {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} parts of the United Kingdom in terms of per capita GDP and average {{household}} incomes. At the same time, parts of the county, especially on the coast, have high house prices, driven up by demand from relatively wealthy retired people and second-home owners. The GVA per head was 65% of the UK average for 2004. The GDP per head for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly was 79.2% of the <b>EU-27</b> average for 2004, the UK per head average was 123.0%. In 2011, the latest available figures, Cornwall's (including the Isles of Scilly) measure of wealth was 64% of the European average per capita.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted in}} the {{preceding}} section, between 1990–1999, {{there was a large}} reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) in emissions of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase in emissions from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards. The emissions reductions in the early nineties by the 12 EIT countries who have since joined the EU, assist the present <b>EU-27</b> in meeting its collective Kyoto target.|$|E
25|$|Industrial output growth reached 6.5% {{year-on-year}} in February 2013, {{the highest}} in the <b>EU-27.</b> The largest local companies include car maker Automobile Dacia, Petrom, Rompetrol, Ford Romania, Electrica, Romgaz, RCS & RDS and Banca Transilvania. Exports have increased substantially in the past few years, with a 13% annual rise in exports in 2010. Romania's main exports are cars, software, clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, military equipment, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers). Trade is mostly centered on the member states of the European Union, with Germany and Italy being the country's single largest trading partners. The account balance in 2012 was estimated to be −4.52% of the GDP.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion in}} EU {{countries}} generally opposes Turkish membership, though {{with varying degrees}} of intensity. The Eurobarometer September–October 2006 survey shows that 59% of <b>EU-27</b> citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier March–May 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the new member states were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as sovereign state and is de facto not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%). Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.|$|E

The study found that [...] emissions during the use phase of its all-electric VW e-Golf are 99% {{lower than those of}} the Golf 1.2 TSI when powers comes from exclusively hydroelectricity generated in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Accounting for the full lifecycle, the e-Golf reduces emissions by 61%, offsetting higher production emissions. When the actual <b>EU-27</b> electricity mix is considered, the e-Golf emissions are still 26% lower than those of the conventional Golf 1.2 TSI. Similar results were found when comparing the e-Golf with the Golf 1.6 TDI. The analysis considered recycling of the three vehicles {{at the end of their}} lifetime.|$|E

2500|$|The legal {{proposals}} aim to {{move away}} from the different systems of the Single Payments Scheme in the EU-15 (which allows for historical references, or a payment per hectare, or a [...] "hybrid" [...] combination of the two) and the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) in most of the EU-12, a new [...] "Basic Payment Scheme" [...] will apply after 2013. This will be subject to [...] "cross compliance" [...] (respecting certain environmental, animal welfare & other rules), as at present, although there are various simplifications to the current requirement. It intends to reduce significantly the discrepancies between the levels of payments obtained between farmers, between regions and between Member States. All Member States will be obliged to move towards a uniform payment per hectare at national or regional level by the start of 2019. In line with the Commission proposals within the Multi-Annual Financial Framework, the national envelopes for direct payments will be adjusted so that those that receive less than 90% of the EU average payment per hectare will receive more. The gap between the amounts currently foreseen and 90% of the <b>EU-27</b> average is reduced by one-third.|$|E
