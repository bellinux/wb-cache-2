40|$|Abstract. Two {{fundamentally}} {{different views of}} how proteins fold <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>debated.</b> Do proteins fold through multiple unpredictable routes directed only by the energetically downhill nature of the folding landscape or do they fold through specific intermediates in a defined pathway that systematically puts predetermined pieces of the target native protein into place? It has now become possible to determine the structure of protein folding intermediates, evaluate their equilibrium and kinetic parameters, and establish their pathway relationships. Results obtained for many proteins have serendipitously revealed a new dimension of protein structure. Cooperative structural units of the native protein, called foldons, unfold and refold repeatedly even under native conditions. Much evidence obtained by hydrogen exchange and other methods now indicates that cooperative foldon units and not individual amino acids account for the unit steps in protein folding pathways. The formation of foldons and their ordered pathway assembly systematically puts native-like foldon building blocks into place, guided by a sequential stabilization mechanism in which prior native-like structure templates the formation of incoming foldons with complementary structure. Thus the same propensities and interactions that specify the final native state, encoded in the amino-acid sequence o...|$|R

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{discusses the}} con-cept of β-cell dedifferentiation in diabetes, {{which is important}} but not well defined. A broad interpretation is that a state of differentiation has been lost, which means changes in gene expression {{as well as in}} structural and functional elements. Thus, a fully mature healthy β cell will have its unique differentiation characteristics, but maturing cells and old β cells will have different patterns of gene expression and might therefore be con-sidered as dedifferentiated. The meaning of dedifferentiation <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>debated</b> because β cells in the diabetic state lose components of their differentiated state, which results in severe dysfunction of insulin secretion. The major cause of this change is thought to be glucose toxicity (glucotoxicity) and that lowering glucose levels with treatment results in some res-toration of function. An issue to be dis-cussed is whether dedifferentiated β cells return to a multipotent precursor cell phenotype or whether they follow a dif-ferent pathway of dedifferentiation...|$|E

40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis has {{emphasized the importance}} of macro financial linkages. In the financial sector, attention <b>is</b> <b>now</b> focusing on macro prudential regulations that are geared toward the stability of the financial system as a whole. In the macro arena, the recognition that price stability was not sufficient to guarantee macroeconomic stability and that financial imbalances developed despite low inflation and small output gaps has highlighted the need for additional tools (macro prudential policies) to complement monetary policy in countercyclical management. Emerging markets (EMs) face different conditions and have key structural features that can have a bearing on the relevance and efficacy of policy measures. Drawing on Canuto and Ghosh (2013), 1 this note discusses the challenges of dealing with macro financial linkages and explores the policy toolkit available for dealing with systemic risks, particularly in the context of EMs. The 2008 {{financial crisis}} has highlighted the challenges asso-ciated with global financial integration and {{emphasized the importance of}} macro financial linkages. Specifically, the crisis has shown how the real sector (business cycles) can interact with and be amplified by the financial sector, resulting in high procyclicality and a buildup of systemic risk in the financial sector that manifests during economic downturns. Although boom-bust cycles in asset prices and credit were observed prior to the recent global crisis, they did not seriously challenge the prevailing paradigm. In the macro are-na, the general view was that keeping monetary policy focused on price and output stability would deliver the best feasible outcome (Bernanke and Gertler 1999, 2001), although some proponents argued in favor of “leaning against the wind” (Blanchard 2000; Borio and White 2004). In the financial sector, prudential policies in most economies focused nar-rowly on the soundness of individual financial institutions. Policies in both the macroeconomic and financial sector arenas <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>debated</b> and reviewed (see Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro [2010, 2013] for overviews).

40|$|Hydrothermal venting {{associated}} with mid-ocean ridge volcanism is globally widespread. This venting {{is responsible for}} a dissolved iron flux to the ocean that is approximately equal to that {{associated with}} continental riverine runoff. For hydrothermal fluxes, {{it has long been}} assumed that most of the iron entering the oceans is precipitated in inorganic forms. However, the possibility of globally significant fluxes of iron escaping these mass precipitation events and entering open-ocean cycles <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>debated,</b> and two recent studies suggest that dissolved organic ligands might influence the fate of hydrothermally vented metals. Here we present spectromicroscopic measurements of iron and carbon in hydrothermal plume particles at the East Pacific Rise mid-ocean ridge. We show that organic carbon-rich matrices, containing evenly dispersed iron(II) -rich materials, are pervasive in hydrothermal plume particles. The absence of discrete iron(II) particles suggests that the carbon and iron associate through sorption or complexation. We suggest that these carbon matrices stabilize iron(II) released from hydrothermal vents in the region, preventing its oxidation and/or precipitation as insoluble minerals. Our findings have implications for deep-sea biogeochemical cycling of iron, a widely recognized limiting nutrient in the oceans...|$|E

The aspect of gender equality is a vital element in the South African Constitution that now links the government’s manifesto to the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Under this imprint, South African municipal governance is constantly looking for new approaches for solving socio-economic issues such as combating poverty and enhancing sustainable development. Gender equality, pro-poor growth strategies and the MDG goal 1 are important focus areas in the discourse on extreme poverty reduction. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore the links between gender equality, pro-poor growth strategies and MDG goal 1. The case study of a specific municipality (Sedibeng District Municipality [SDM]) is explored, providing a detailed analysis of its gender equality measures and pro-poor strategies.

The Comcast ruling represents {{a significant change in}} the FCC's direction: given the FCC's past decisions that broadband Internet access services do not fall within the "common carrier" category, it is notable that the agency has now imposed nondiscrimination requirements on these services. This Article shows that the rationales articulated in the FCC's Comcast order, stressing both (i) concerns about protecting competition and (ii) concerns about protecting consumers from disruption of their ability to communicate freely and privately, are rooted in centuries of Anglo-American law defining he obligations of "common carriers. " The FCC appears to be moving away from its traditional emphasis on the competition policy concerns, which justify asymmetrical regulation of dominant providers for the sake of enabling competition, and toward an emphasis on the consumer protection issues, which justify symmetrical regulation of all service providers regardless whether they have market power.

40|$|We publish here Henry Philip's {{updating}} of {{his earlier}} history of Scottish school examinations, taking the account {{to the end of}} the twentieth century. His first volume, published in 1992 by the Scottish Examination Board as The Higher Tradition, took the story from the founding of the modern system in 1888 to the late 1980 s; it is now an indispensable guide to the subject, and hence also to the whole development of Scottish secondary schools in the period. This latest volume takes the story to the threshold of the significant reforms to it that were put in place in 1999 - 2000. The details of the recent changes charted here by Mr Philip are of importance in themselves, affecting as they have done the lives of almost everyone who has attended school in Scotland in the past twenty years. In that sense, this more recent volume deals with matters of far greater social significance than most of the first volume, which covered periods when the examination system affected the schooling of only a minority of students. The final stages of that earlier account did track the rapid expansion of examinations that took place in the three decades from the early 1960 s, but the culmination of this aim of assessing everyone in the hope of providing opportunity for everyone was not reached until the late 1990 s. Mr Philip's story thus contributes to our understanding of a fundamental shift in our view of what schooling is about. Running through that enormous change, however, even from the earliest days when the old Leaving Certificate catered for no more than about 4 per cent of the school population, was a sense of continuity, of old educational values, which were deemed to be typical of Scottish culture itself, being gradually extended to ever-widening social groups and hence being constantly democratised. That sense of permanence through change was brought into dispute in the period covered by Mr Philip here, and is increasingly a matter of controversy with the impending new reform of the curriculum and examination system that has been in the making since around 2002, with the support of most shades of political and educational opinion. In that sense, Mr Philips work here, finishing (by coincidence) at the moment when the Scottish Parliament took responsibility for Scottish education, is also an account of the end of a system that now seems quite firmly in the past, although laying the basis for what <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>being</b> <b>debated.</b> The process of change described by Mr Philip is also of great interest to any student of Scottish policy making, whether or not they are concerned with the specifics of educational policy. This is the most detailed study we yet have of any area of policy making in the final decade of the old Scottish Office, and his account of the development of the examination system will remain definitive at least until all the relevant official archives are released, which will not be until 2030 or even possibly 2050. Mr Philip has been given access to many revealing internal papers, and is able to investigate in detail the exchanges among ministers, officials and senior inspectors of education. He is thus able (in Chapter 5) to explain more cogently than any previous writer on this subject what happened between the proposals to reform the examination system that were made in 1992 by the official committee chaired by Professor John Howie and the policy pronouncements by the Scottish Office in its Higher Still proposals of 1994 onwards. The picture that emerges is of a Scottish Office that still contained a great deal of creative energy, and of ministers who did not demur at making radical changes even when their political and constitutional position seemed increasingly precarious. This was not a governing system in terminal decline despite the assumptions of much public political debate in the 1990 s and all those involved appear, in Mr Philip's account, to be seeking to lead a consensus that would command popular support. But it also remained a process that was largely invisible to public scrutiny, unlike the more recent debates in and around the Scottish parliament (not the least of which was about the near-collapse of the new examinations system in 2000). Mr Philip's careful exploration of the old policy-making system thus provides opportunities for comparison with the new governing structures that have been developed since 1999.
