5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter <b>general</b> <b>response</b> since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the <b>general</b> <b>response.</b> The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

Awwad also praised the track's vocals and production together, and commended the line [...] "Hey why don’t you hit me up". Chris Taylor of The 405 praised the song's catchiness.

500|$|On the film's initial release, the French critics' <b>general</b> <b>response</b> was moderate, {{ranging from}} mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment, {{claiming}} {{it to be}} either a repetition of German expressionism or simply a disappointment of the director's leap from documentary filmmaker to a genre film-maker claiming the film {{to be in a}} [...] "minor genre, quite unworthy of his abilities". Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously. In England, Isabel Quigly, film critic for The Spectator, called it [...] "the sickest film since I started film criticism", while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired. A review in Variety was negative, noting specifically that the [...] "stilted acting, asides to explain characters and motivations, and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact" [...] and an [...] "unclear progression and plodding direction give [...] an old-fashioned air". The Monthly Film Bulletin opined that [...] "when a director as distinguished as Georges Franju makes a horror film...one cannot but feel tempted to search for symbols, an allegory, layers, or interpretation. Unhappily there is practically nothing in this inept work to offer any encouragement for doing so." [...] The review noted [...] "a strange and poetic opening" [...] and that Schuftan's [...] "haunting camerawork allies itself perfectly to Maurice Jarre's obsessive score" [...] while" [...] Brasseur and Valli were [...] "sadly wasted" [...] and that they [...] "do what they can with almost non-existent characters" ...|$|E

"Ah, well, I see you {{are drawing}} her out," [...] said Miss Birdseye to Mrs. Farrinder; {{and at the}} idea that this process had been {{necessary}} Basil Ransom broke into a smothered hilarity, a spasm which indicated that, for him, the fun had already begun, and procured him another grave glance from Miss Chancellor.

[...] Miss Birdseye presented her companion; she was sure Mrs. Farrinder would be interested; she wouldn't want to lose an opportunity, even if for herself the conditions were not favourable. And then Miss Birdseye addressed herself to the company more at large, widening the circle so as to take in the most scattered guests, and evidently feeling that after all it was a relief that one happened to have an obscurely inspired maiden on the premises when greater celebrities had betrayed the whimsicality of genius. It was a part of this whimsicality that Mrs. Farrinder--the reader may find it difficult to keep pace with her variations--appeared now to have decided to utter a few of her thoughts, so that her hostess could elicit a <b>general</b> <b>response</b> to the remark that it would be delightful to have both the old school and the new.|$|E

All will be bidden to prepare for war, and, when the news comes that the Iceni have taken up arms, to assemble and march to join us. On this day fortnight, then, let every chief with his following meet at Cardun, which is but a short march from Camalodunum.
