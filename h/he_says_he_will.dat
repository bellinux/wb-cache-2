It depicts Misako bound and tortured and directs him to a breakwater, where the following day he is to be killed. Hanada submits to the demand but kills the killers instead. The former client arrives and announces himself as the legendary Number One Killer. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> kill Hanada but, in thanks for the work he has done, is only giving a warning at present.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{figures out}} what Homer saw from the {{movements}} of his pupil. They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that {{the other one is}} coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E

25|$|Socrates concludes {{his legal}} defence by {{reminding}} the judges that he shall not resort to emotive tricks and arguments, shall not cry in public regret, {{and that his}} three sons will not appear in court to pathetically sway the judges. Socrates says he is unafraid of death and shall not act contrary to religious duty. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> rely solely upon sound argument and truth to present his case at trial.|$|E
25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive every day, as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>will.</b> No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease {{to have to wait}} for Godot.|$|E

25|$|Later on, Deadra and Ghat reach a large desert area. When Ghat {{returns from}} hunting rabbit-like creatures, he discovers a blind {{mercenary}} {{known only as}} the Hunter, who points a rifle at Deadra's head while she sleeps. The Hunter reveals that he was sent after them by Ghat's family, and was instructed to kill both him and Deadra. Ghat pleads for her life, and the Hunter agrees to let her live if Ghat will come to a secluded area with him to fight. Ghat manages to defeat the Hunter and then leaves with Deadra. Ghat and Deadra eventually {{reach the end of}} the world. It is there that they meet Golem, an ancient being placed there by an unknown group of people to wait there until he was needed.

Kenneth Lynn writes that the irony to modern readers is that both characters in [...] "that boat on the lake would one day do away with themselves".
