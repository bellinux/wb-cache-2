25|$|Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution {{transformed}} agriculture {{around the}} globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The {{energy for the}} Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels {{in the form of}} fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation. The peaking of world <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>production</b> (peak oil) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production. One vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth's surface (i.e., buildings, vehicles and roads) doing artificial photosynthesis (using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer) efficiently than plants.|$|E
25|$|The Nuclear Assisted <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>Production</b> Method, Canadian patent {{application}} 2,659,302, {{is a method}} for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear waste materials comprising the placing of waste materials into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an unconventional oil formation. The thermal flux of the waste materials fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation.

50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of this compound {{was initially}} identified by its similarity to other known pathways found in bacteria that produce similar long-chain <b>hydrocarbons.</b> <b>Production</b> of monounsaturated and tri-unsaturated long-chain hydrocarbons in various microbial lineages has {{been attributed to}} the oleABCD gene cluster. In this pathway two acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP are condensed using a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation to yield a β-keto-thioester. Hydrolysis from the enzyme is followed by reduction of the β-keto group to an alcohol catalyzed by an NADPH dependent reductase OleD. The remaining steps include decarboxylation and dehydration, which might be combined as a single decarboxylation elimination step. The exact roles of OleB and OleC in this pathway are unknown, however deletion of oleC yielded a strain that produced a mono-ketone product without the completed olefin.|$|R
