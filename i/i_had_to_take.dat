500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, and so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E

Due to Spector's perfectionism in the studio, he made Turner sing the song {{over and over}} for several hours until {{he felt he had}} the perfect vocal take for the song.

2500|$|Listed as a 6'5" [...] forward/center in 2000, Turner was a 26-year-old rookie with Dungannon. At first, Turner didn't {{know what}} to make of Ireland. He was struck by the locals' {{hospitality}} and intrigued by the country's history, but he was initially unimpressed by the amenities and customs. Turner explained, [...] "I was still on my spoiled American high horse. 'The locker rooms are too small. I’ve got to carry my own bag. We don't practise enough. They want me to coach the local kids when I just want to play.' But when I went back to America for the Christmas break, I realised that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my blinders off or I'd end up just like my friends at home, doing nothing or working in a job they hated." [...] He came to embrace the lifestyle and it showed on and off the court. However, while he was considered 'prolific' and made a significant contribution every game, he often lacked support in offensive situations. In a 92–74 loss to Tralee Tigers in January 2001, Turner had a 49-point effort.|$|E

[...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep. [...] I used to come home at nights from a banquet or something and people would call me sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first, Bourguiba was {{enrolled}} in the French-Arab elementary school of Monastir. There, he got close to a French teacher, Pierre Mounier-Pillet, and had kept contact with him for years, as they met forty years later in Cairo. But Ali, who wanted his son to have an exemplary education and chances like his brothers, sent him to Tunis {{in order to live}} with his brother M'hamed. In 1907, Bourguiba left Monastir toward Tunis, on board of Sousse train, which got him to the capital city, marked with the separation with his mother at 5 years old. He could only see his mother during summer vacations, after nine months of isolation. Years later, Bourguiba recounted that experience saying: [...] "It was in 1907, such a journey at that time was not that easy. It was a real expedition. We went to Sousse thanks to a diligence that belonged to a Maltese named Carlo. This vehicle was dilapidated and needed the four or five passengers to get off in order to push it whenever we ascended a hill or retain the slope so that the hitch is not crushed. Arrived in Sousse, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the train from the Bone-Guelma Company. It took four or five hours to reach Tunis". At his arrival, the city was marked with the fight against the protectorate and the emergence of the Tunisian national movement, led by Ali Bach Hamba.|$|E

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Emperor and Empress both {{decided to}} send Nicholas and George on a nine-month-long trip to Japan in 1890. George would go as a naval cadet and Nicholas to {{complete}} his education by seeing something of the world. Their mother hoped the warm sun and the sea air would improve George's health. They left Gatchina on 4 November 1890. The Empress had never been separated from her sons {{for such a long}} time and she missed them terribly. [...] "You cannot imagine how sad and hard it is to be without you, my angel, and how dreadfully it hurts to think of this long separation", she wrote sadly. Nicholas and George first went by warship to Athens where they were joined by their cousin, Prince George of Greece, known as [...] "Greek Georgie". From there, they traveled to Egypt. From [...] Bombay in India, Nicholas telegraphed that his brother George had to remain on ship because he had trouble with his leg. Although George assured his parents that he was perfectly well, they were suddenly informed he had a fever and would have to return home. The Empress was alarmed. [...] "You can't imagine in what anguish I have passed these last few days", she wrote. [...] "In spite of all the reasoning ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> things calmly, and to tell myself that it ... is only this horrible malaria that will pass with a change of air ..." [...] George, in fact, had acute bronchitis and was sent back to Athens where he could be examined by the Imperial doctors. The Empress was distressed for both brothers: George, whose disappointment she felt deeply and Nicholas, who was now deprived of his brother's company.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father Mike had to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. When I came back I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. I was over the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a back seat [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition. I would have stayed for ages if I had good stuff, but I wasn’t getting the work [...] I wasn't that upset when I was told [...] I kind of predicted it [...] My character hadn’t been working out for ages [...] it will be a relief not to be Mickey Miller any more!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The lead single, had an on air, on sale release, Roberts {{stated that}} Universal Records wanted {{to release the}} track that way, {{as it was the}} way they were {{releasing}} all of their new work. The release of this nature, was due to illegal downloading, and the record label was attempting to avoid illegal downloads as much as possible as Roberts stated, [...] "it's now harder for artists". Talking of Girls Aloud, Roberts stated she was used to releasing a song after around six weeks of promotion, including radio, television and press promotion, and commented that it was [...] "very scary" [...] to release a song without this publicity. She also noted the effect of this kind of release against chart positions, she said, [...] "I think it's harder for the public now because it's always been about the chart position. I also think it takes the excitement out of the charts because it's not a competition anymore." [...] The album artwork and track-listing were confirmed on 22 August 2011 on Roberts official website, the announcement came with confirmation that fans who pre-ordered the album on Play.com would receive a signed poster, and those who pre-ordered the song from digital store iTunes would have an exclusive highlight video montage of her webisode series Through Nicola's Eyes. Roberts performed at G-A-Y, after rehearsing the entire day prior to the event during which time she changed her set-list around, performing the track [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] with a drum and bass edit, in addition to performing a remix of her single [...] "Lucky Day". For the performance Roberts wore five-foot hair extensions that touched the ground, which proved restricting for her movements, in addition to wearing shorts with [...] "big pompoms on the back". Writing as a guest blogger for site Holy Moly, Roberts discussed the event saying [...] "the crowd was incredible. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my in-ears out because they were so loud I thought, ‘They’re gonna deafen me and I’m not gonna {{be able to do the}} rest of my set’.
