500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's {{a part of this}} family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon said she thought Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single shred of evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> completely untrue".|$|E
2500|$|The single's {{original}} B-side was [...] "Don't Blame Me", {{which later}} appeared as an album track on their 1974 album Old New Borrowed and Blue. In a 1979 fan club interview, Lea said: [...] ""Don't Blame Me" [...] was a time-filler, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created as that. When {{it was used}} as a b-side, we didn't even know it was being used, it was chosen by the offices. We were in America recording the Christmas single, there was a rush to choose what to put on the back of it, and that track happened to be used." ...|$|E

2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I ask you if you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you that when you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Meli√°n Lafinur.|$|E

60|$|Be it so. I {{hope it is}} so. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is not so easy}} {{to believe}} it as we fancy.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, smiling, [...] "it isn't that I fancy myself {{any better}} than my fellows. I was at Magdalen, you know, under Heysey. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his {{influence}} which shaped our ideas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My Prince," [...] he said, [...] "I have {{to report}} that this fellow's {{companion}} escaped us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> with the connivance {{of one or more}} of the men at the gate. I have ordered them all under arrest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those being your sentiments, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a {{pity the}} duty is not intrusted to some officer of broader views." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps it will, sir. A better brother never lived, but he {{may have}} been too ready to fall in with other people's views. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very great pity that he did not apply for a {{commission}} in the army." ...|$|E
60|$|Anyhow, I was famished when we awoke. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the {{pangs of}} hunger that awoke me.

6000|$|... "It is not I who do anything," [...] Jeanne said. [...] "It is you {{who have}} brought this upon both of us. All this money that has been spent upon luxuries, it was absurd. If I was not rich I did not need them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more than absurd. It was cruel." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her quizzically, {{as if this were}} much droller than if she had cared. [...] "I don't {{understand}} why you should have gone into it. You told me, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> repugnant to you; and it's hard work for a woman, and very uncertain work for anyone. You must have had a tremendous desire to benefit your race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {585}[783] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a carpet}} on which Diogenes trod, with--"Thus I trample on {{the pride of}} Plato!"--"With greater pride," [...] as the other replied. But as carpets {{are meant to be}} trodden upon, my memory {{probably}} misgives me, and it might be a robe, or tapestry, or a table-cloth, or some other expensive and uncynical piece of furniture.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to Mary Hutchinson's pool, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not on the}} beck [...] anywhere, {{but some}} {{detached}} little pool, far up the hill, to the [...] eastwards of the Hall, in 'the woods.' The description does not well [...] suit any part of Rydal beck; and no spot thereon could long 'remain [...] unknown,' as the brook was until lately much haunted by anglers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{exceedingly}} nice of you," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{appreciate the}} compliment. Really," [...] he went on, with a smile, [...] "I {{think we are}} quite safe, aren't we? You are known as a man-hater, and you are allowed special privileges because {{you are what you}} are. And I am known to be in love with another woman." ...|$|E
60|$|Still I {{was most}} {{uneasy about the}} man who, as I had noted for a long while, was losing his balance more and more. The shock of the barbarous and dreadful {{slaughter}} of his half-breed children and of the abduction of Inez by these grim, man-eating savages began the business, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> increased and accentuated by his sudden conversion to complete temperance after years of heavy drinking.|$|E
60|$|So it {{came about}} that within {{little more than an}} hour of our {{boarding}} of that ship she was running out towards the sea as fast as tide and wind could drive her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not too soon, for as the quay vanished in the gloom I saw men with lanterns moving on it, and thought to myself that perhaps an alarm had been given and they were come to take me.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{affection for}} Tredowen," [...] she {{repeated}} wonderingly. [...] "Do {{you know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Pengarth? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is the most beautiful}} house in the world!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask no payment," [...] Rachel {{answered}} wearily, {{when she}} understood the words; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is <b>I</b> who need protection from that wicked dwarf." ...|$|R
