Matters were not <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E

5|$|Small sized {{pterosaur}} species {{apparently were}} present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that there is a}} strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> purchase of overseas territory.|$|E

5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that interest rates at the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E

5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses {{and a number of}} awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E
5|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon {{abandoned by the}} Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. <b>Helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> spirit of Athena who was elevated {{to a new level}} of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself is the key to pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Ascension is a third-person action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Santa Monica Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). The game was first released on March 12, 2013, for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) console. It is the seventh installment in the God of War series and prequel to the entire series. Loosely based on Greek mythology, the game is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, the former servant of the God of War Ares, who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter. In response to this tragedy, Kratos renounced Ares, breaking his blood oath to the god. Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies, guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment. <b>Helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> oath keeper Orkos, Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be completely free of his bond to Ares.|$|E

5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|In Ascension, it is {{revealed}} that because Kratos renounced Ares, it broke his blood oath to the god and as such, Kratos was imprisoned and tortured {{by the three}} Furies. He was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> oath keeper Orkos and eventually overcame and killed the Furies. In order to completely be free of Ares' oath, Kratos was forced to kill Orkos, who begged Kratos to do so. Although free of his oath to the god, he was flooded with memories of killing his family. He then vowed to serve the other gods {{in order to receive}} forgiveness and relief from the nightmares of his past deeds, but he was openly defiant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} against John Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
