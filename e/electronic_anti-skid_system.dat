50|$|Maxaret, {{developed}} by Dunlop in the UK, quickly found uses on most UK military aircraft, {{such as the}} Handley Page Victor, BAC TSR.2, and English Electric Lightning. Civil aircraft included airliners such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident. Many companies followed suit, both in military and civilian models. One interesting variation was used on the Fokker F-27 aircraft, which, {{because it did not}} have a hydraulic system, used a high-pressure pneumatic system to actuate the brakes, including the Maxaret <b>anti-skid</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight.

25|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, the Dunlop Maxaret <b>anti-skid</b> <b>system</b> was in {{widespread}} aviation {{use in the}} UK, with aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Valiant, English Electric Lightning, de Havilland Comet 2c, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and later aircraft, such as the Vickers VC10, Hawker Siddeley Trident, Hawker Siddeley 125, Hawker Siddeley HS 748 and derived British Aerospace ATP, and BAC One-Eleven being fitted with Maxaret as standard. Maxaret, while reducing braking distances by up to 30% in icy or wet conditions, also increased tire life, and had the additional advantage of allowing take-offs and landings in conditions that would preclude flying at all in non-Maxaret equipped aircraft.|$|R

50|$|For CAT IIIc, {{the flight}} control {{computer}} will continue to accept deviations from the localizer and use the rudder to maintain the aircraft on the localizer (which is aligned with the runway centerline.) On landing the spoilers will deploy (these are surfaces {{on the top of}} the wing towards the trailing edge) which causes airflow over the wing to become turbulent, destroying lift. At the same time the autobrake system will apply the brakes. The <b>anti-skid</b> <b>system</b> will modulate brake pressure to keep all wheels turning. As the speed decreases, the rudder will lose effectiveness and the pilot will need to control the direction of the airplane using nose wheel steering, a system which typically is not connected to the {{flight control computer}}.|$|R
2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low.

40|$|Electronic {{assemblies}} {{are getting}} more and more important for modern automobiles. The electronic market is characterized by short innovation cycles (5 years). Contrary to this, in the automotive industry the supply of spare parts has to be guaranteed for a period of 15 years. To close the resulting gap, the supply strategies "longterm storage", "periodic manufacturing", "downward compatibility" and "reuse/remanufacturing" are practicable. These strategies are characterized by technical restrictions and by different values regarding sustainability. In order to support the decision-making process in spare part management, suitable methods and working aids are needed. This paper describes a methodology which includes the selection of suitable supply strategies for spare part supply from a technical point of view with the evaluation of appropriate strategies considering technical, economical, environmental and social aspects.

40|$|Modern cars {{exhibit a}} variety of new {{functionalities}} concerning engine management, safety, vehicle dynamics control as well as comfort and convenience. Safety features like airbags, antilock braking <b>systems</b> (ABS), <b>anti-skid</b> <b>systems,</b> belt tensioners or the electronic stability program (ESP) are standard fittings of present day car models and in some cases even stipulated by legislation. These safety systems have led to an increased avoidance of accidents by actively affecting vehicle dynamics and to a mitigation of the consequences of accidents on the driver and passengers by innovative restraint systems. As a rule these systems are mechatronic systems. Mechatronic systems today derive their functionality by an interlocked interaction of mechanics, electronics and information technology. Their deployment in the safety-relevant environment requires fault tolerance. Fault tolerant mechatronics is based on redundancy, which must be supervised and tested permanently. Reliability of sensor and actuator technology is essential for future motor vehicle systems. Operability and reliability are to be achieved by suitable on-board and on-line test methods.

40|$|Abstract: The {{electric}} traction drive systems on {{basis of the}} induction motors fed by the static converters have lead to remarkable performances for the urban electric trains, concerning both the train dynamics and the environment issues.

But, in case of the underground electric metro operation it is necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of the mechanical brake unrecovered energy, particularly the amount of the material developed (the brake blocks wear) in the mechanical brake process. Because this mechanical braking energy can be considered equal (as value) to the electrical energy (the active component) of the starting process, in the paper had been simulated a transient starting regime, using MATLAB software and SIMULINK-Sim Power Systems Extensions. Consequently, it had been evaluated the active braking material wear (the brake shoes wear) in the underground metro mechanical braking process, which has important environmental impacts.

40|$|The {{braking system}} of the landing gear wheels of a {{mainline}} aircraft has to meet mandatory requirements {{laid out in the}} Aviation Regulations AP- 25 (Para 25. 735. «Brakes and brake systems"). These requirements are essential when creating the landing gear wheel brake control system (WBCS) and are used as main initial data in its mathematical modeling. The WBCS {{is one of the most}} important systems to ensure the safe completion of the flight. It is a complex of devices, i. e. units (hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical), connected through piping, wiring, mechanical constraints. This complex should allow optimizing the braking process when a large number of parameters change. The most important of them are the following: runway friction coefficient (RFC), lifting force, weight and of the aircraft, etc. The main structural elements involved in braking the aircraft are: aircraft wheels with pneumatics (air tires) and brake discs, WBCS, and cooling system of gear wheels when braking. To consider the aircraft deceleration on the landing run is of essence at the stage of design, development, and improvement of brakes and braking systems. Based on analysis of equation of the aircraft motion and energy balance can be determined energy loading and its basic design parameters, braking distances and braking time. As practice and analysis of energy loading show, they (brake + wheel) absorb the aircraftpossessed kinetic energy at the start of braking as much as 60 - 70 %, 70 - 80 %, and 80 - 90 %, respectively, under normal increased, and emergency operating conditions. The paper presents a procedure for the rapid calculation of energy loading of the brake wheel. Currently, the mainline aircrafts use mainly electrohydraulic brake systems in which there are the main, backup, and emergency-parking brake systems. All channels are equipped with automatic <b>anti-skid</b> <b>systems.</b> Their presence in the emergency (the third reserve) channel significantly improves the reliability and safety of the aircraft braking mode with a slight increase in weight and complexity of the system. Mathematical modeling of the WBCS is intended to provide the possibility for studying the effect of various parameters on the braking process, choice of a rational law of the anti-skid automatics and minimization of the brake way on the runway in designing the WBCS, and its certification for compliance with AP 25 under normal operation and in appearing of credible failures. The article presents differential equations of motion of the braking {{system of the}} aircraft landing gear wheel, which is an electro-hydraulic actuator to form the braking torque Мт, depending on the control signal Uу. The actuator comprises a remote control system of pressure and multi-disc friction brake. This mathematical model of the braking system of aircraft landing gear wheel allows us to study the braking process in a wide variation range of different parameters both of the braking system itself and its components, and of the aircraft parameters, runway conditions, and <b>anti-skid</b> <b>system</b> parameters, i. e. it provides an optimized braking process in conditions of changing a large number of different parameters the most important of which are: RFC, lifting force and aircraft weight; speed of the aircraft; parameters of the WBCS hydraulic units, etc. </p...|$|R

40|$|For a small {{electric}} vehicle (EV) with the rear two in-wheel motors, the hydraulic brake {{system and the}} mechanical brake system are installed at {{the front and rear}} tire respectively. The mechanical brake system is used at the rear tire because there is no enough space for the hydraulic brake system. In a braking condition, the in-wheel motor at the rear tire will generate the regenerative braking force and it can improve the braking performance of the vehicle. However, during braking on the low adhesion road surface, anti-lock brake system (ABS) is very crucial to prevent the tire from lock-up. To improve the safety and stability of the vehicle, the combination of <b>anti-skid</b> control <b>system</b> and direct yaw moment control system is proposed. The <b>anti-skid</b> control <b>system</b> contains a hydraulic unit of ABS at the front tires and regenerative brake timing control at the rear tires. The control method of the regenerative brake timing control is same as ABS and it will turn on and off to prevent the tire from lock-up.

The optimal control is used as the control strategy method to control the yaw moment. The simulation is developed in MATLAB Simulink and the result shows that the proposed model can improve the stopping distance from 9 seconds to 8. 2 seconds.
