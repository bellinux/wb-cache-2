5|$|Homer signs {{his family}} {{up for the}} show. Marge is traded to a nice, easygoing man named Charles Heathbar and his perfect son, while Homer gets Charles' strict wife Verity. Charles {{seems to be a}} husband who dislikes his wife and is {{constantly}} told by <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so he is surprised to see that Marge is understanding and kind. As Marge enjoys her time with Charles, he begins to develop an infatuation for her. Meanwhile, Homer, Bart, and Lisa are having major troubles with Verity, who disciplines them and objects to everything they do.|$|E
25|$|When {{the second}} superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro {{disagreed}} on which side was right - Pietro not liking {{the idea of}} profiling people {{based on what they}} might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past - past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could be more dangerous than the existing situation, and she resented Pietro still trying to tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath. He has also been revealed to have fallen under the telepathic control of the Red Skull, acting as a 'sleeper agent' in the Avengers as part of the Skull's current campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Marina Oswald {{testified that}} her husband {{told her that he}} {{traveled}} by bus to General Walker's house and shot at Walker with his rifle. She said that Oswald considered Walker to be the leader of a [...] "fascist organization." [...] A note Oswald left for Marina {{on the night of the}} attempt, telling <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> if he did not return, was not found until ten days after the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
60|$|Patsy {{stood looking}} at <b>her</b> and {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>To</b> lose this place was certainly a great calamity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{mother says}} we may play {{together}} to-day, as {{she wants to}} make up <b>her</b> mind <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about you. But I hope you will stay here always, as I can't bear you to go away. Have you ever been on the sea?' ...|$|R
50|$|An old man {{brought back}} two {{fish from the}} market for his daughters. The older one ate hers, but the younger asked <b>her</b> fish <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it. It told her {{to put it in}} water, and it might repay her; she puts it in the well.|$|R
60|$|And Mrs. Korner, {{only too}} thankful for some {{one to tell}} <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> obeyed in all things.|$|E
60|$|Olof {{knew all}} the plans of the Queen, and went to tell the Princess what had been done, whereupon Hadvor earnestly entreated her to tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She fell on her knees; {{she tried}} wildly {{to pray for}} {{inspiration}} that should tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] "Oh, God, how can I give that woman back the happiness of which I have robbed her!" ...|$|E
60|$|And then {{overriding}} her altogether, he told <b>her</b> <b>what</b> {{he meant}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{about their future}} {{and the future of}} their little son.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; if {{you don't}} love her, you mustn't marry <b>her.</b> But <b>what's</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> I don't know. Poor thing, poor thing, how unhappy she must be!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Lifeline" [...] is {{the second}} single by Brooke Fraser from <b>her</b> debut album <b>What</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> with Daylight. It was the first single {{released}} by Fraser in Australia.|$|R
60|$|What {{would not}} Albinia have given for Winifred to laugh with <b>her?</b> <b>What</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now {{she did not}} know, so she thought it best not to hear, and to ask {{the way to a}} carpenter's shop to order some book-shelves.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you please," [...] {{said the}} girl, quietly. Evidently this {{explained}} why Madam Borne had discharged her so heartlessly. The gentleman from Isham, Marvin & Co. had doubtless interviewed the Madam and told <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And then, knowing {{she would be}} at liberty, he had sent her this private instructor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dora is too good," [...] said Anne. [...] "She'd behave {{just as well}} {{if there}} wasn't a soul to tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She was born already brought up, so she doesn't need us; and I think," [...] {{concluded}} Anne, hitting on a very vital truth, [...] "that we always love best {{the people who need}} us. Davy needs us badly." ...|$|E
60|$|C-y K-g:--When my most {{intimate}} friend walks with another girl and exchanges lace patterns with <b>her,</b> <b>what</b> ought I <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Ans. Adopt a dignified attitude.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, {{she met the}} director-producer Mark Tinker, {{who asked}} <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life. She told him, [...] "I want to paint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He acts {{just like}} our dog, but I don't {{see how it}} can be him. Sancho, Sancho, is it really you?" [...] called Betty, at <b>her</b> wits' end <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} for some days a point of anxiety with <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Green during {{the morning of the}} wedding. Chance {{unexpectedly}} helped her in this difficulty. The day before the purchase of the license Green came to Lady Constantine with a letter in her hand from her husband Anthony, her face as long as a fiddle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Conway, what am I to do? what am I to do?" [...] said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. Dalrymple stood perplexed {{for a few}} minutes, {{and could}} not tell her what she was to do. She {{was in such a}} {{position}} that {{it was very hard to}} tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] "Do you believe, Conway, that he is really ruined?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She don't {{know what}} it is; she can't read!' shrieked Gride, not heeding the inquiry. 'There's only {{one way in which}} money can be made of it, and that is by taking it to her. Somebody will read it for her, and tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She and her {{accomplice}} will get money for it and be let off besides; they'll make a merit of it--say they found it--knew it--and be evidence against me. The only person it will fall upon is me, me, me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dominie, I warrant it's true. It'll be Babbie. Sanders doesna suspect, because I've telled {{him nothing}} about <b>her.</b> Oh, <b>what's</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done?</b> They were baith {{so good to}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Puzzling <b>her</b> brain <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next, Louise {{suddenly}} {{decided to}} confide her secret to her two cousins. Not that she considered them {{capable of a}} greater success than she could herself accomplish, but they might prove valuable assistants in the capacity of lieutenants. She had great respect for Beth's calm judgment and keen intuitions, and Patsy {{had a way of}} accomplishing difficult things with ease.|$|R
60|$|Durade {{led her to}} a {{table that}} had been placed under some shelves which were {{littered}} with bottles and glasses. He gave <b>her</b> instructions <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when called upon, saying that Stitt would help her; then motioning her to a chair, {{he went back to}} the men. It was difficult for her to raise her eyes, and she could not at once do so.|$|R
60|$|The old mother's instinct--not the old mother's reason--told <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She {{drew her}} {{daughter}} to the open window, and called to Kitty to come in. The child (still amusing herself by fishing in the lake) laid down her rod. Mrs. Linley saw her running lightly along the little pier, {{on her way to}} the house. That influence effected what no other influence could have achieved. The outraged wife controlled herself, for the sake of her child. Mrs. Presty led her out to meet Kitty in the garden; waited until she saw them together; and returned to the breakfast-room.|$|E
60|$|Julia put up {{her face}} to be kissed, as she did to all her mother's visitors, and then Mr. Thorne found that he had got her and, what was much more terrific to him, all her finery, into his arms. The lace and starch {{crumpled}} against his waistcoat and trousers, the greasy black curls hung upon his cheek, {{and one of the}} bracelet clasps scratched his ear. He did not at all know how to hold so magnificent a lady, nor holding <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her. However, he had on other occasions been compelled to fondle little nieces and nephews, and now set about the task in the mode he always had used.|$|E
60|$|Before long, tidings {{of these}} {{wonderful}} young men reached the palace, {{where the old}} King now lay ill, and the Queen lived in fear of her life, for the people hated her and might break out at any moment. She sent for the Brothers; and they came at once, hoping to do some good. Nobody recognized the pretty Princes in the tall young monks, half hidden in their hoods and gowns; but comfort and courage seemed to come with them, for the sick King grew stronger when they prayed or sang beside him, and the sad Queen took heart, and confessed her sins to them, begging them to tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> since selfish splendor brought neither happiness, love, nor honor.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{long time}} before the child was at all reconciled. When her sobs began to cease, her {{grandfather}} told <b>her</b> <b>what</b> she was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when she saw the squire.|$|R
60|$|Janet plainly had no {{faith in}} the {{possibility}} of anything being done for Kilmeny. But a rosy glow of hope flashed over Kilmeny's face when Eric told <b>her</b> <b>what</b> he meant <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Claire was piqued. She {{was in the}} {{position}} of a hostess who has swept and garnished her house against the coming of a guest and waits in vain for that guest's arrival. She made up <b>her</b> mind <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when Dudley Pickering proposed to her next time, and thereby, it seemed to her, had removed all difficulties in the way of that proposal. She little knew her Pickering! ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fulmort did see Miss Charlecote, {{and though}} {{speaking}} little herself, was gratified by the visit, {{and the voices}} talking before her gave her a sense of sociability. This preference enabled Phoebe to enjoy {{a good deal of}} quiet conversation with her friend, and Honora made a point of being at Beauchamp twice or three times a week, as giving the only variety that could there be enjoyed. Of Mervyn nothing was heard, and house and property wanted a head. Matters came to poor Mrs. Fulmort for decision which were unheard-of mysteries and distresses to her, even when Phoebe, instructed by the steward, did her utmost to explain, and tell <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It would end by feeble, bewildered looks, and tears starting on the pale cheeks, and 'I don't know, my dear. It goes through my head. Your poor papa attended to those things. I wish your brother would come home. Tell them to write to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The front-door was {{standing}} wide open, as {{was always the}} innocent fashion in these regions, with a half-angle of moonlight and shadow lying within its dusky depths. Mara listened a moment,--no sound: {{he had gone to}} bed then. [...] "Poor boy," [...] she said, [...] "I hope he is asleep; how he must feel, poor fellow! It's all the fault of those dreadful men!" [...] said the little dark shadow to herself, as she stole up the stairs past his room as guiltily as if she were the sinner. Once the stairs creaked, and her heart was in her mouth, but she gained her room and shut and bolted the door. She kneeled down by her little white bed, and thanked God that she had come in safe, and then prayed him to teach <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next. She felt chilly and shivering, and crept into bed, and lay with her great soft brown eyes wide open, intently thinking what she should do.|$|E
60|$|And {{about this}} time Angela woke up too, for she always rose early, {{and ran to the}} window to see what sort of a day she had got for her birthday. Seeing it to be so fine, she threw open the old lattice, at which her pet raven Jack was already tapping to be admitted, and let the sweet air play upon her face and neck, and thought what a {{wonderful}} thing it was to be twenty years old. And then, kneeling by the window, she said her prayers after her own fashion, thanking God who had spared her to see this day, and praying Him to show <b>her</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life, and, if it was His will, to make it a little less lonely. Then she rose and dressed herself, feeling that now that she had done with her teens, she was in every respect a woman grown-- indeed, quite old. And, in honour of the event, she chose out of her scanty store of dresses, all of them made by Pigott and herself, her very prettiest, the one she had had for Sunday wear last summer, a tight-fitting robe of white stuff, with soft little frills round the neck and wrists. Next she {{put on a pair of}} stout boots calculated to keep out the morning dew, and started off.|$|E
6000|$|... "See there," [...] said August, {{pointing}} to {{tracks in the}} sand. The imprints of little moccasins reassured Hare, for he had feared the possibility suggested by the upturned boat. [...] "Perhaps it'll be better if I never find her," [...] continued Naab. [...] "If I bring her back Snap's as likely to kill her as to marry her. But I must try <b>to</b> find <b>her.</b> Only <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her--" ...|$|R
60|$|THE CONDUCTOR. My {{advice to}} you {{is to have a}} berth made up, and go to bed till we get to Boston, and {{surprise}} your wife by telling <b>her</b> <b>what</b> you tried <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] {{said the}} King, drawing himself {{suddenly}} {{into a state}} of haughty attention, and fixing his eye firmly on the supposed criminal; [...] "what of <b>her?</b> <b>what</b> of <b>her?</b> <b>What</b> has she <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this matter?" ...|$|R
