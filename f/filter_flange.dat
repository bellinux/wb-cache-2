40|$|Abstract. Korea is {{supposed}} to design, fabricate, deliver and install the ITER tritium storage and delivery system (SDS). For the successful procurement some major technologies have to be verified in the detailed design stage. Currently, have been invested the characteristics of several ZrCo storage materials, improvements of the getter beds to increase hydrogen delivery and recovery rates through small scale mock-up test of the beds, the fabricability of the bed designed considering the economical perspective, the performance verification for operation processes of the SDS using experimental apparatus and SDS bed simulator. The on-going R&D results are introduced in this paper. No difference was observed on the rates of hydriding and dehydriding for two bead and sponge type ZrCo samples. The hydrogen retention rates were measured using 1 / 10 scale bed and found to be dependent of the pressure of ZrCo hydride. The attachment methods of <b>filters,</b> heaters and <b>flange</b> to the primary and secondary vessels of the full scale bed were developed to minimize the cost satisfying the design requirements. Also, to determine the optimal thickness and to prove the robustness of the vessels structural and buckling analyses were performed. The in-bed calorimetry performance of the bed was investigated by using three dimensional thermo-hydraulic model. It {{was found that the}} volume of primary vessel and the cooling scheme are key parameters for high performing in-bed calorimetry. Prepared is an experimental apparatus capable of verifying the performance of several unit processes such as delivery and recovery, He- 3 collection, in-bed calorimetry, etc. In order to simulate the various bed operation scenarios under normal and accident conditions a bed simulator has been developed. The pressure as a function of time was simulated perfectly and the tuning of mass flow rates are on-going...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} the Rossendorf superconducting RF gun is discussed. This gun allows {{continuous}} wave operation with an energy of 9. 5 MeV and an average current of 1 mA. The 3 cell niobium cavity contains a normal conducting photocathode. A special choke <b>flange</b> <b>filter</b> at the cathode side prevent the RF leakage of the cavity. The design of the cavity, the tuner, the RF coupler the LHevessel together with the cryostat is finished and now in manufacturing. In the paper three features are discussed, which follows from the special demands of the 3 cell superconducting RF gun. The first feature is the tuning system. For the cavity two different tuners are necessary, one for the half cell (gun cell) {{and one for the}} accelerating cells. The second feature is the tuning of the cathode. The beam properties depend very sensitive on the cathode position. Therefore a special cathode tuner has been developed, which allows to move and to adjust the cathode position inside the cavity. The third no conventional feature is the excitation of a second RF mode inside the cavity. This is a magnetic mode (TE mode) which replaces the static magnetic field in normal conducting RF guns and decreases the transverse emittance of the beam by more than a factor of two.
