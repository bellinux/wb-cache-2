50|$|After {{the sample}} has been processed, the extract can be {{analysed}} {{using a variety}} of data analysis techniques. The chemical analysis and analytical instrumentation used depends on the goal of the study. Many analyses require multiple samples, although in some cases a single POCIS sample can be used for multiple analyses. It is vital to use quality control (QC) procedures when using passive samplers. It is common practice for 10% to 50% {{of the total number of}} samples to be used for QC purposes. The number of QC samples depends on the study objectives. The QC samples are used to address issues such as sample contamination and analyte recovery. The types of QC samples commonly used include; reagent blanks, <b>field</b> <b>blanks,</b> matrix spikes, and procedural spikes.|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> are {{mandatory}} when sampling odour emission. <b>Field</b> <b>blanks</b> are matrices {{that have}} negligible or unmeasurable {{amounts of the}} substance of interest. They are used to document possible contamination during sampling, transport and storage of samples. Although <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> are well established in odour emission research, interpreting the results needs further attention. This {{can be attributed to}} the fact that published information on the topic is rare if not absent. In the present study, general statistical measures of <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> used in odour measurement research, are reported. The objective of the study was to provide insight in the distribution of field blank values. During 2013 and 2014, <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> were analysed as part of regular investigations into odour emissions. Point sources were most frequently observed (87 %), as well as the use of diluting stack samplers (72 %). It was found that average odour concentration and standard deviation of the dataset were 1. 39 and 0. 379 log(ouE/m 3) respectively, both expressed on a logarithmic scale (base 10). Median values of odour concentration of <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> taken with stack sampler methods, differed significantly from lung sample methods, being a factor two higher. Since the implementation of stack sampler methods requires more processing aids than the lung method, the chances are that that traces of odour are carried over from one sampling sessions to another. This stresses the need for effective cleaning of sampling equipment between sampling sessions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{years of}} {{collocated}} data collected at two {{sites in the}} Hong Kong PM 10 speciation network {{were used to assess}} measurement precision and generate error structures for source apportionment modeling. Overall, the data quality was deemed to be very good. The PM 10 collocated data relationships suggest that additional significant figures could be retained in the data set for some of the species. An analysis should be conducted to determine the appropriate number of significant figures. This refinement would improve the ability to assess measurement uncertainty using the collocated data and might improve the data quality. For PM 10, laboratory blanks are routinely analyzed but <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> are currently not being collected. It would be very helpful to routinely collect <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> data so the limit of quantification (LOQ) could be assessed. The <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> LOQs are expected to be higher than would be estimated from the laboratory blanks because there can be additional contamination of the filters during transport and handling.

Detailed water sampling requirements are specified in ISO 5667. A questionnaire found that no laboratory, which responded, is currently accredited or in the process of attaining accreditation to this standard. In general, the procedures and practices in environmental laboratories questioned fall significantly short of the requirements of ISO 5667, particularly in relation to the preservation of samples, the documentation of sampling training procedures and the maintenance of training records.

30|$|Monitoring {{data are}} {{available}} only {{for some of the}} candidate substances. For most of these, measured concentrations in water bodies indicate a low risk compared with published PNEC values. For DEET, measured concentrations in North American surface waters are in the same range as the standard PNEC values of 0.043 [27] or 0.076 mg/L [28] and indicate a potential risk for US waters. Concentrations detected in Europe are about one order of magnitude lower (Table  1). Since 1998, the readily degradable icaridine (Bayrepel®) has been used as substitute for DEET and, as expected, its monitoring values with negligible concentrations in STP effluents reflect the ready degradability in sewage treatment plants [25]. No monitoring data for German or European surface waters could be found for EBAAP (IR 3535 ®), an agent in modern consumer products. It is worthwhile to mention that some monitoring data on PT 19 biocides and other contaminants were said to be biased due to contamination of samples by insect repellents applied by field workers during sampling campaigns [46]. The detection of DEET in <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> as well as the contamination of reagents with isophorone prompted the authors [46] to exclude the respective values.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe routine use of {{biomonitoring}} (i. e., {{measurement of}} environmental chemicals, their metabolites, or specific reaction products in human biological specimens) to assess internal exposure (i. e., body burden) has gained importance in exposure assessment. ObjectivesSelection and validation of biomarkers of exposure are critical factors in interpreting biomonitoring data. Moreover, the strong relation between {{quality of the}} analytical methods used for biomonitoring {{and quality of the}} resulting data is well understood. However, the relevance of collecting, storing, processing, and transporting the samples to the laboratory to the overall biomonitoring process has received limited attention, especially for organic chemicals. DiscussionWe present examples to illustrate potential sources of unintended contamination of the biological specimen during collection or processing procedures. The examples also highlight the importance of ensuring that the biological specimen analyzed both represents the sample collected for biomonitoring purposes and reflects the exposure of interest. ConclusionsBesides using high-quality analytical methods and good laboratory practices for biomonitoring, evaluation of the collection and handling of biological samples should be emphasized, because these procedures can affect the samples integrity and representativeness.

Although the interference-free determination at m/z 56 could be obtained by using methane as the reaction gas, the best signal-to-background ratio was achieved by using ammonia and performing the measurements at m/z 54.
