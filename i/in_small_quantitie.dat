40|$|It {{is likely}} that humans {{have some form of}} {{inherent}} sys-tem for representing quantity—specifically, for represent-ing exact quantities up to three and for making reasonable estimates for larger quantities (see, e. g., Dehaene, 1997; Gallistel & Gelman, 1992). Number words (e. g., “five”) and other quantitative words and phrases (e. g., “more than”) are mapped onto these inherent representations in ways that allow people to communicate about quan-tity. Much is known about children’s mapping of number words onto cognitive representations of specific quantities (Fuson, 1988) and about how children estimate on math-ematical tasks, such as a number line (Siegler & Opfer, 2003). Much less is known about how quantitative phrases are used in colloquial speech and whether there are dis-cernible patterns in these phrases that reflect constraints on how people inherently represent quantities, whether they are based on the structure of the school-taught base- 10 number system and other cultural systems (e. g., time), or whether they are some combination of constraint and cultural conventions. Dehaene and Mehler’s (1992) cross-linguistic study of people’s number use uncovered an inverse relationship between the magnitude of numbers and the frequency of usage, with local peaks at numbers such as 10, 12, 15, 20, 50, and 100. The same basic pattern was found for all seven languages assessed in this study. Dehaene and Meh-ler concluded that the preference for small numbers may have been due to the more precise underlying quantitative representations, whereas the prevalence of “reference nu-merals, ” such as 10 and 50, reflects use of our less precise approximations for larger quantities. Reference numerals may provide an anchor for mapping numerals and num-ber words onto the underlying approximate representa-tional system and for guiding a variety of daily activities in modern cultures. When searching for a street address at 1615, an understanding of the quantitative sequence of 100, 200, [...] . 1000 allows people to scan for the cor-rect block and to focus attention on individual addresses once the 1600 block is reached. At the same time, studies of traditional cultures without formal education indicate a much more limited range of number words that likely map onto the precise representations for <b>small</b> <b>quantitie...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in learning is ignoring the teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group discussion. So, today, teaching in student-based methods such as work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group is emphasized. Nevertheless, this method is not used for teaching physiotherapy students. This study was performed {{to determine the effect}} of teaching <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group on satisfaction and learning level of second- year students in physiotherapy in comparison with lecture teaching. Materials and methods: An experimental study was performed on 29 physiotherapy students. The students were randomly classified into two groups; lecture (14 people) and work <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group (15 people). Students were educated for 4 sessions. Two separate questionnaires were used to assess learning and satisfaction levels. Results: Overall satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group was significantly greater than lecture group (P 0. 05). 86. 7 % of students <b>in</b> <b>small</b> groups preferred to be educated in the future semesters using this teaching method. Conclusion: This study showed the role of small group teaching on increasing students' satisfaction level. Due to increased satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>small</b> group, despite the lack of significant difference between the two methods of learning, learning process can be facilitated. Thus this method is recommended for education of the undergraduate students...|$|R

30|$|Results {{reveal that}} in general, the {{association}} between minimum wages and firms’ actual wages, for both production workers and non-production workers, is robust and significant. For production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages {{is associated with a}} 1.8 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 0.8 percent increase in wages in large firms. For non-production workers, a 10 percent increase in real minimum wages is associated with a 1.65 percent increase <b>in</b> wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but only 1.2 percent in larger firms. The association between minimum wages and actual wages is significant, of large magnitude <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms, but less so in larger firms. This suggests that wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are more sensitive to changes in minimum wages, which is consistent with the fact that on average, wages <b>in</b> <b>small</b> firms are significantly lower. <b>In</b> other words, <b>small</b> firms are more likely to raise their wages in response to an increase in minimum wages because their wages are more binding.|$|R

Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> large versus <b>small</b> financial systems. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while in large financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. <b>In</b> <b>small</b> markets, they transfer external finance across borders and in large markets they tend to take on more risky projects.

The purpose of this correlational {{study was to examine}} the extent and nature of the association between owner-manager separation <b>in</b> <b>small</b> businesses and the structure of IT governance in the businesses. Agency theory formed the theoretical framework of this study. Data were collected using a web-based survey and randomly sampled 3, 697 small {{business owners}} and managers located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

A centralized form of IT governance was most prevalent <b>in</b> <b>small</b> businesses. Small business owners maintained influence over IT governance decisions despite ceding responsibility to managers for operational components of their business, a condition that appears to conflict with pure agency theory. The research findings may contribute to a better understanding of technology governance <b>in</b> <b>small</b> businesses, which <b>in</b> turn could lead to more effective and efficient operation of those businesses.
