40|$|To {{investigate}} if {{the chronic}} administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) would exert anxiolytic effects when rats {{are exposed to}} a stressor {{in the form of}} bright light, 40 female and 40 male PVG /c hooded rats were individually treated with approximately 61, 114, or 160 mg/kg of ascorbic acid in their drinking water. Following treatment, each rat was exposed to a 5 -min trial in the open-field (OF), the elevated plus-maze (EPM), and the light-dark box (LDB) either with or without the presence of a bright light stressor. A number of dose-related anxiolytic effects were observed that appeared to depend on the measure of anxiety used. This was evident with higher frequencies of walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>OF</b> <b>for</b> rats treated with 114 and 160 mg/kg of ascorbic acid. Furthermore, 114 mg/kg of ascorbic acid led to rats spending more time in the light compartment of the LDB, but this was true only for rats in the low stress condition. Interestingly, 61 mg/kg and 114 mg/kg produced a sex-related anxiogenic effect for rats tested in the EPM, with 61 mg/kg leading to a decrease in open arm entries for females, and 114 mg/kg leading to an increase in open arm entries for both sexes combined. Furthermore, male rats in the high stress condition made a higher percentage of entries into the open arms and fewer entries into the closed arms of the EPM. Male rats treated with 114 mg/kg also had lighter adrenal gland weights compared to controls. These results suggest that a dose of 1. 45 g/day of vitamin C may have the potential of reducing anxiety in humans under certain conditions. However, vitamin C may not be as effective under high stress conditions but rather may be useful for anxiety experienced when low levels of stress are present...|$|E
