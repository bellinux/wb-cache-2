50|$|In {{the arcade}} and on home consoles, fast-paced action and {{real-time}} gameplay were {{the norm in}} genres like racing and target shooting. On the mainframe, however, such games were generally not possible due both {{to the lack of}} adequate displays (many computer terminals continued to rely on teletypes rather than monitors well into the 1970s and even most CRT terminals could only render character-based graphics) and <b>insufficient</b> <b>processing</b> power and memory to update game elements in real time. While 1970s mainframes were more powerful than arcade and console hardware of the period, the need to parcel out computing resources to dozens of simultaneous users via time-sharing significantly hampered their abilities. Thus, programmers of mainframe games focused on strategy and puzzle-solving mechanics over pure action. Notable games of the period include the tactical combat game Star Trek (1971) by Mike Mayfield, the hide-and-seek game Hunt the Wumpus (1972) by Gregory Yob, and the strategic war game Empire (1977) by Walter Bright. Perhaps the most significant game of the period was Colossal Cave Adventure (or simply Adventure), created in 1976 by Will Crowther by combining his passion for caving with concepts from the newly released tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). Expanded by Don Woods in 1977 with an emphasis on the high fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien, Adventure established a new genre based around exploration and inventory-based puzzle solving that made the transition to personal computers in the late 1970s.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that loss of b-cell mass andcompromised b-cell function are telltale indicatorsof the development of type 2 diabetes (1).

The inability of b-cells to compensate for insulin resistance is associated with several abnormalities in b-cell function such as mitochondrial stress and reactive oxygen species production, <b>insufficient</b> proinsulin-to-insulin <b>processing,</b> and increased expression of islet amyloid polypeptide.

40|$|Abstract – The {{dramatic}} increase in the computational speed provided by state-of-the-art high-end DSP’s offers the possibilities of processing large high-resolution images in real time. The authors have experience in high-fidelity lossy compression of high-resolution color medical images (up to 2048 x 4096 pixels, eight bits per pixel) using TI’s TMS 320 C 6201 DSP’s. The amount of on-chip memory in C’ 6000 DSP cores is <b>insufficient</b> for <b>processing</b> such images using internal memory only. Allocating the data to the external memory can increase the execution time significantly. The use of direct memory access channels (DMA) does not lead to a substantial decrease of the execution time for unstructured algorithms, i. e. the algorithms in which the data processing order is highly dependent on the results of the previous steps in the algorithm. We have developed and tested a technique, which decreases execution time for such algorithms by applying them to only one subband of a signal dependent wavelet transform. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Despite recent {{advances}} in FPGA, GPU, and general purpose processor technologies, the challenges posed by real-time digital image processing at high resolutions cannot be fully overcome due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>processing</b> capability, inadequate data transport and control mechanisms, and often prohibitively high costs. To address these issues, we proposed a two-phase solution for a real-time film grain noise reduction application.

The second phase is based on a novel heterogeneous reconfigurable computing platform that offers flexibility not available from other computing paradigms. This paper introduces the heterogeneous platform and briefly reviews our previous work with the application in question, as well as its implementation on the FPGA demonstration board during the first phase. Then we present a decomposition of the application, which allows an efficient mapping to the new heterogeneous computing platform through the use of its diverse reconfigurable computing units and run-time reconfiguration.

30|$|Another key methodological {{distinction}} of NDLs {{is that they}} are deployed (in their either analog or digital implementations) sufficiently early in the signal chain to combine bandwidth reduction with interference mitigation. Numerical filtering algorithms (e.g., digital nonlinear filters) are typically deployed after the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), when the bandwidth of the signal + interference mixture is reduced to below half of the sampling rate and it is often already ‘too late’ to deal with non-Gaussian interference effectively. Indeed, the non-Gaussian nature of interference {{can be viewed as a}} result of the ‘coupling’ of various interference components in a wide frequency band. Bandwidth reduction destroys this coupling, making the interference appear more ‘Gaussian-like’ and reducing our ability to distinguish it from the thermal noise and to effectively remove it. Thus, <b>insufficient</b> <b>processing</b> bandwidth often severely limits the effectiveness of state-of-art nonlinear interference mitigation techniques. While this can be overcome by increasing the sampling rate (and thus the acquisition bandwidth), this further exacerbates the memory and DSP intensity of numerical algorithms, making them unsuitable for real-time implementation and treatment of nonstationary noise.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{behavioral}} and electrophysiological {{studies have shown}} dissociation between consonants and vowels. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to investigate whether vowel and consonant processing differences are expressed in the neuronal activation pattern and whether they are modulated by task. The experimental design involved reading aloud and lexical decision on visually presented pseudowords created by transposing or replac-ing consonants or vowels in words. During reading aloud, changing vowels relative to consonants increased activation in a right middle temporal area previously associated with prosodic processing of speech input. In contrast, during lexical decision, changing consonants relative to vowels increased activation in a right middle frontal area associated with inhibiting go-responses. The task-sensitive nature of these effects demonstrates that conso-nants and vowels differ at a processing, rather than stimulus, level. We argue that prosodic processing of vowel changes arise during self-monitoring of speech output, whereas greater inhibition of go-responses to consonant changes follows <b>insufficient</b> lexico-semantic <b>processing</b> when nonwords looking particularly like words must be rejected.
