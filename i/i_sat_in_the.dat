40|$|The {{first time}} I {{encountered}} {{the concept of}} “sitting with <b>the</b> pain” was <b>in</b> supervision, some eight years ago when I was doing an internship in counselling psychology. This was following a particularly difficult session with a client, who was clinically depressed and was desperately trying to process her feelings of grief and loss. As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> session, an intense feeling of helplessness took over me and I fought hard to {{resist the urge to}} provide her with a solution and a “quick-fix”. Later in supervision, as I related what happened, I realized that I was actually afraid to confront my own anxiety <b>in</b> <b>the</b> session, and to confront my own assumptions about what my role as a therapist is. As I delved deeper into my own fears, I realized that I was afraid to confront the reality, the fact that I could not “save” my clients, that I could not take away their pain and that I could not do their work for them...|$|R
30|$|I often {{arrived at}} the site {{together}} with the half an hour earlier to help set-up and stayed for an additional hour for clean-up and after-class debriefing. When I was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> class, <b>I</b> often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back or {{on the side of}} the classroom, observing the class co-taught by the two teachers. They often divided the class time into two sessions and each teacher was responsible entirely for one session. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> class worked more like two individual teachings, rather than one co-teaching, although the content of the two sessions was often related. Occasionally I was invited by the co-teachers to model <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> students, distribute utensils to the students, or be a station leader during activity time. When I observed the class, I paid particular attention to teachers’ instruction, their interactions with students and interactions among students. I also conducted two individual interviews with both teachers during the third week of the program to understand their teaching philosophies, their prior teaching experience and professional development <b>in</b> Taiwan and <b>the</b> United States, how they perceived their American students and American education in general, and how they interpreted their Chinese class in this context. Both interviews were around 1 – 1.5  h long. Since the program was the first afterschool program that offered Mandarin education for young children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood, it attracted observers who were graduate students in language education and sought to become Mandarin teachers. I also interviewed a frequent class observer, who is also from Taiwan doing her Master’s degree in TESOL, about her perceptions of the classroom and both teachers’ teaching. The interview was about half an hour long. In addition, I had several informal and personal conversations with three one-time observers, again who are all from Taiwan pursuing their graduate degree <b>in</b> TESOL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. All the interviews were conducted in Mandarin and then translated to English by me. I focus my translation on content and for some culturally specific terms that I have difficulty in finding their English counterparts, I include the original terms that the interviewees used and put the possible English translation in parenthesis in this paper. Finally, I also had some casual talks and communication with parents, especially those who started the program, and our conversations provide insight for my interpretation of the data that I collected through classroom observation. This study is a result of at least 40  h of on-site participation and interviews from September to December 2009. Observational data and interview transcripts went through an iterative process of open coding, initial memos, focused coding, and integrative memos (Creswell, 2013; Maxwell, 2013).|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> 1997, <b>the</b> first {{graduate}} {{law student}} conference {{ever to be}} held at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and perhaps in all of Canada, was convened at its Green College. It was primarily organized by the present author (now a professor at the Osgoode Hall Law School) and Jaye Ellis (currently {{a professor of law at}} McGill University. Jaye and I also had the dedicated help and support of a number of other graduate law students. Critically, both of us profited immensely from the robust support, extraordinary commitment and expert guidance of Professor W. Wesley Pue, who at the time held <b>the</b> Nemetz Chair <b>in</b> Legal History and also served as the Director of Graduate Legal Studies at UBC. Professor Pue’s highly imaginative mind, his highly developed communication skills, his wise advice, and his steadfastness were extremely helpful as my collaborator and I plotted, planned and executed on what began its eventful life in a conversation between Jaye and <b>I</b> while we <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> then graduate law student’s lounge at UBC. Ever the committed mentor, Professor Pue enthusiastically threw the full and considerable weight of the graduate law program behind us – two young graduate students who were still green <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business of conference organizing. Since there was at the time no Canadian precedent for what we planned to do, no model to follow, and no manual to read out of, Professor Pue’s expertise, experience and sage advice was a critical factor <b>in</b> shaping <b>the</b> success that the event eventually was. The financial generosity shown to this first conference by the Pue-led graduate program was extremely helpful as well. It is, thus, safe to say that we could not have done it without his support.

40|$|School size {{has been}} {{considered}} to be an important variable in student academic performance since the 1950 s (Conant, 1959). Significant foundation work has been established regarding the relationship that exists between school size and student academic performance. Researchers have found relationships, albeit inconsistent in nature, between school size and student achievement and school climate (Conant, 1967; Haller, 1992; Martin, 1998; Sybouts 2 ̆ 6 Bartling, 1988). That is, in some studies students have been found to perform better in small schools whereas in other studies students have been found to perform better in large schools. ^ Because schools are increasing in enrollment size as a result in population growth and/or school reorganization, the phenomenon of increased school size merits further investigation. This investigation needs to occur on multiple dependent variables and on an adequate sample size of schools. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of secondary school size on student academic performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state of Texas. These relationships were examined separately for White, for African-American, and for Hispanic students. Student performance consisted of: Reading, Math, Writing on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS); end-of-course exams in Algebra I, Biology, English II, and U. S. History; ACT and <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> average scores; dropout rates, completion rates, and attendance rates. These relationships were examined separately for the last three years of data available (1999 – 2000; 1998 – 1999; 1997 – 1998) on all traditionally configured high schools in Texas for which data were provided from the Texas Education Agency. ^ Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) statistical procedures were conducted to determine the relationship that existed between school size and student academic performance for each grouping of dependent variables separately by ethnic membership. Whenever the MANOVA procedure resulted in reduced sample sizes, separate univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedures were conducted for individual dependent variables. ^ Numerous statistically significant findings were yielded in this study, with effect sizes ranging from small to large. Secondary school students, regardless of ethnicity, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State of Texas had significantly higher performance on the TAAS, end-of-course exams, and on <b>the</b> ACT and <b>SAT</b> <b>I</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> large size schools than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small size schools. Secondary school students, regardless of ethnicity, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State of Texas had significantly higher attendance and graduation rates in small schools than in large schools. ^ These findings replicate and extend <b>the</b> existing literature <b>in</b> that <b>the</b> performance of each ethnic group was examined separately and that student academic performance was measured in several different ways. Clearly school size is related to student academic performance, however, the relationship appears to be complex. Recommendations for further research and for policy makers and for practitioners were provided. ...|$|R
