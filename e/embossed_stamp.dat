5000|$|The {{tell-tale}} insignia is an <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp</b> on {{the underside}} of the cymbal. There are two versions of this stamp. The first simply reads [...] "Bellotti" [...] on capital block letters. The second version also reads [...] "Bellotti," [...] but also incorporates the logo of a bell. Often, Bellottis have an embossment that reads [...] "Italy" [...] or [...] "Made in Italy" [...] in a semicircular pattern. This embossment appears on other Italian cymbals of the 1940s-1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Items of postal {{stationery}} with an imprinted stamp are sometimes found with adhesive stamps added {{to pay for}} additional services such as airmail, registration or the part transport of mail by a local postal service. Such covers are known as conjunctive covers, and such use {{is known as a}} conjunctive use. Placement of the adhesive stamp in addition to the imprinted stamp in order to pay a higher postal rate is called [...] "uprated" [...] (Spanish= franqueos complementarios). [...] This term also applies when an imprinted or <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp</b> is overprinted or handstamped to increase the face value.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, the sweets were {{embossed}} by {{hand with}} a stamp, to form their traditional look (the workers who did this were known as [...] "cakers" [...] {{and were able to}} produce upwards of 30,000 per day), but now they are usually machinery formed. The <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp</b> was originally a stylised image of Pontefract Castle with a raven on the top bar, which is thought to have been in use for almost 400 years. When the first secret ballot in the United Kingdom was held in Pontefract on 15 August 1872, the ballot box used was sealed using a Pontefract cake stamp from Frank Dunhill’s factory, which shows the image of a castle and an owl.|$|E

5000|$|In the 70s, {{the company}} name was changed to Zanki, perhaps because the Italian [...] "ch" [...] is {{pronounced}} as a [...] "k"; or, perhaps, simply as a marketing device. During the 70s, Zankis usually had large ink logos with the 'Zanki' name. Sometimes the character font was hollow, sometimes bold. The <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp</b> was changed to read [...] "ZANKI Italy". These cymbals were still handmade, but were heavier, and more conventional-sounding, and are considered {{by some to be}} comparable to a late 60s or early 70s Avedis Zildjian cymbal. Zanki occasionally still used the name Vibra on some of their 70s series cymbals, but they do not resemble the F & F Vibras from earlier, in either hammering or lathing.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps Fiorello Zanchi's biggest {{contribution}} to cymbal-making history was his {{development of the}} [...] "rotocasting" [...] technique, in which molten bronze is poured into a cymbal cast that is mounted on a centrifuge, and rotated as the liquefied metal is being cooled inside the cast. This new technique created a brand new sound in Italian cymbals, much brighter than the previous Zankis. It is reputed that Fiorello used the larger workshop at UFIP to do his rotocasting. These rotocast cymbals bore a new <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp,</b> [...] "Zanki Rotocasting". Some of these cymbals also show an additional embossment that reads: [...] "Music Industries". Still others show an ink stamp by the Italian distributor [...] "Mario Corso". It would appear from the varying stamps of this period that Zanki was associating with different distributors {{in an attempt to}} keep the cymbals on the market.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold. These notes were issued under emergency wartime legislation, Ordinance 10 of 1914. At first the typeset notes were signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood, though he later used stamps. The notes bore the <b>embossed</b> <b>stamp</b> of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes. The 1914 notes were issued in denominations of 2 and 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 50 pounds. The 2 shilling and 50 pound notes were not continued when {{a new series of}} notes was introduced in 1927. The 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50 pence coin during the process of decimalization. In 1975, 10 and 20 pound notes were introduced, followed by 50 pounds in 1986. The 1 pound note was discontinued in 1988. In 1995, a new series of notes was introduced which, for the first time, bore the words [...] "pounds sterling" [...] rather than just [...] "pounds". The government of Gibraltar introduced a new series of banknotes beginning with the 10 and 50 pound sterling notes issued on July 8, 2010. On May 11, 2011, the 5, 20 and 100 pound sterling notes were issued.|$|E
