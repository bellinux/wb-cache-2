5|$|Lennon {{did much}} of his songwriting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> where he had several Studer tape recorders.

(These demos, and some other, more avant garde sound {{recordings}} also made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> have appeared on various bootlegs). The attic also contained a mellotron, an electronic organ, a piano, a Vox AC30 amplifier and several guitars (including his first Rickenbacker 325, a Hofner Senator, and his Rickenbacker 1996), {{all of which were}} used when songwriting.

Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic,</b> where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo.

In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attic.</b>|$|E

40|$|New {{insulation}} fiberboards from {{sunflower cake}} with improved thermal and mechanical properties were produced by pressing at ambient temperature. Best compromise between mechanical and heat insulation properties (λ = 77. 6 mW/m K at 25 °C) was a starch-based board with 20 % binder content. Because of its promising heat insulation properties, this new fiberboard could be positioned on walls and ceilings for thermal insulation of buildings.

Also considering the small colony (maximum 59) and cluster sizes (maximum 13 bats), behaved less thermophilic than other attic-dwelling species.

Emergence began approximately 30  min after sunset; the bats used multiple, preferably crevice-like openings. left its summer roosts comparatively late; renovation works should, therefore, not start before November.

It seems this cow was not <b>the</b> only bovine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens.
