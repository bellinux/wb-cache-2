40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} the trophic shift of young-of-the-year (YoY) thinlip <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Liza ramada and <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Liza aurata during their recruitment in a salt marsh located on the European Atlantic coast. Stable isotope signatures (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of the fishes followed a pattern, with enrichments in 13 C and 15 N to increasing length: δ 13 C in fishes 30 mm δ 13 C ranged from - 15. 8 to - 12. 7 ‰, closer to the level in salt marsh food resources. Large differences between the δ 15 N values of mullets and those of food sources (6. 0 ‰ on average) showed that YoY are secondary consumers, like older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YoY mullets shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30 mm in length. The results highlight the role of European salt marshes as nurseries for juvenile mullets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDispersant {{use is a}} {{controversial}} technique used to respond to oil spills in nearshore areas. In order to assess the toxicity of this technique, this study evaluated the cardiac toxicological effects on juvenile <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Liza aurata exposed for 48 h to either dispersant alone, chemically dispersed oil, mechanically dispersed oil, the water soluble fraction of oil or to a control condition. Following exposure, the positive inotropic effects of adrenaline were assessed in order to evaluate a potential impairment on the cardiac performance. The results revealed an impairment of the positive inotropic effects of adrenaline for all the contaminants (single dispersant, dispersed and undispersed oil, water soluble fraction of oil). This suggests that: (i) cardiac performance is a valuable parameter to study the physiopathological effects of dispersed oil; (ii) dispersant application is likely to impair cardiac performance...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDispersant use in nearshore {{areas is}} likely to {{increase}} the exposure of aquatic organisms to petroleum. To measure the toxicity of this controversial response technique, <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> (Liza aurata) were exposed to mechanically dispersed oil, chemically dispersed oil, dispersant alone in seawater, water-soluble fraction of oil and to seawater as a control treatment. Several biomarkers were assessed in the gills (enzymatic antioxidant activities, glutathione content, lipid peroxidation) and in the gallbladder (polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons metabolites). The significant differences between chemically dispersed oil and water soluble fraction of oil highlight the environmental risk to disperse an oil slick when containment and recovery can be conducted. The lack of significance between chemically and mechanically dispersed oil suggests that dispersant application is no more toxic than the natural dispersion of the oil slick. The results of this study are of interest in order to establish dispersant use policies in nearshore areas...|$|R

Despite the relative abundance of investigations carried out on Hg toxicity, there is a scarcity of studies on its DNA damaging effects in fish under realistic exposure conditions. This study assessed the Hg genotoxicity in <b>Golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> (Liza aurata) at Laranjo basin, a particularly contaminated area of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) well known for its Hg contamination gradient. (1) Fish were seasonally caught at Laranjo basin and at a reference site (S.

Using the comet assay, blood was analyzed for genetic damage and apoptotic cell frequency. The seasonal survey showed greater DNA damage in the Hg-contaminated area for all sampling seasons excluding winter. The temporal variation pattern of DNA lesions was: summer ≈ autumn > winter > spring. Fish caged at Laranjo also exhibited greater DNA damage than those caged at the reference site, highlighting the importance of gill uptake on the toxicity of this metal. No increased susceptibility to apoptosis was detected in either wild or caged fish, indicating that mercury damages DNA of blood cells by a nonapoptotic mechanism. Both L. aurata and the comet assay proved to be sensitive and suitable for genotoxicity biomonitoring in mercury-contaminated coastal systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDispersant {{application}} is an oil spill response technique. To evaluate the environmental {{cost of this}} operation in nearshore habitats, the experimental approach conducted in this study exposed juvenile <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> (Liza aurata) for 48 hours to chemically dispersed oil (simulating, in vivo, dispersant application), to dispersant alone in sea water (as an internal control of chemically dispersed oil), to mechanically dispersed oil (simulating, in vivo, natural dispersion), to the water-soluble fraction of oil (simulating, in vivo, an oil slick confinement response technique) and to sea water alone (control condition). Biomarkers such as fluorescence of biliary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites, total glutathione liver content, EROD (7 -ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase) activity, liver antioxidant enzyme activity, liver lipid peroxidation and an innate immune parameter (haemolytic activity of the alternative complement pathway) were measured to assess the toxicity of dispersant application. Significant responses of PAH metabolites and total glutathione liver content to chemically dispersed oil were found, when compared to water-soluble fraction of oil. As it was suggested in other studies, these results highlight that priority {{must be given to}} oil slick confinement instead of dispersant application. However, since the same patterns of biomarkers responses were observed for both chemically and mechanically dispersed oil, the results also suggest that dispersant {{application is}} no more toxic than the natural dispersion occurring in nearshore areas (e. g. waves). The results of this study must, nevertheless, be interpreted cautiously since other components of nearshore habitats must be considered to establish a framework for dispersant use in nearshore areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{input and}} distribution of organic contaminants in the Mar Menor lagoon have been recently characterized in seawater and sediments, showing the significant impact of flash flood events. Mar Menor is a hypersaline (42 - 47 psu) coastal lagoon located in the Cartagena Field area at the South East of Spain subjected mainly to intensive agriculture, seasonal tourism and recreational activities. The bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) has been also determined in bivalves, but no information was available about their accumulation in fishes. In this study the concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and OCPs in <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Liza aurata) and red mullet (Mullus barbatus) muscle were determined. Their spatial distribution throughout the Mar Menor lagoon was characterized considering 9 sampling areas and two different sampling periods, spring and autumn in 2010 for <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> and only one (autumn) for red mullet. PAHs and organochlorinated pollutants were extracted using specific Soxhlet procedures. After cleanup and purification steps the final extracts were analyzed by HPLC for PAHs, and by GC-MS for PCBs and OCPs. The higher concentrations of all pollutants were found close to main urban and port areas of this lagoon and in the influence area of El Albujón watercourse. PAHs concentrations (sum of 14 congeners) in both species varied between 1 and 20. 7 g/kg w. w. being pyrene and phenanthrene the most abundant ones. p,p’DDE showed higher concentrations than PAHs in <b>golden</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (concentration range: 0. 2 - 32. 7 g/kg w. w.), specially close to the main navigation channel between this lagoon and the Mediterranean Sea.

ATP content of sperms were determined at two different sampling temperature (10 - 12 and 18 - 20 °C) and two different keeping temperature (4 °C and room temperature) for 6 h and also ATP content assayed until 10 days storage in the three extender types (glycerol, 0. 7 and 0. 65 % salt solution). Results of the present study showed that, ATP content of sperms, collected at 10 - 12 °C was 74. 04 ± 7. 22 %, in comparison to 18 - 20 °C. The ATP content of sperms during 6 h keeping at 4 °C and room temperature were 90. 26 ± 0. 91 % and 17. 17 ± 1. 49 %, respectively.
