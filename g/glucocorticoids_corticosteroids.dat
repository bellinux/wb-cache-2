40|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> (<b>corticosteroids)</b> {{are highly}} {{effective}} in combat-ing inflammation {{in the context}} of a variety of diseases. How-ever, clinical utility can be compromised by the development of side effects, many of which are attributed to the ability of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to induce the transcription of, or transactivate, certain genes. By contrast, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are due largely to their ability to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. This effect has been predominantly attributed to the repression of key inflammatory transcription factors, including AP- 1 and NF-B, and is termed transrepression. The ability to functionally sepa-rate these transcriptional functions of GR has prompted a search for dissociated GR ligands that can differentially induce transrepression but not transactivation.
