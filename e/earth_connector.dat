5000|$|Twin {{and earth}} (often written [...] "T&E" [...] and {{sometimes}} [...] "T and E") is a colloquial {{name in the}} UK, Australia, New Zealand and other countries for a type of flat sheathed fixed mains electricity cable, containing two insulated current carrying conductors and an <b>Earth</b> <b>connector.</b> In Australia and New Zealand this type of cable {{is referred to as}} 'Flat TPS' (Thermo-plastic sheathed), as well as [...] "Twin and Earth" [...] or [...] "Twin with Earth".|$|E
40|$|The {{final stages}} of this work saw changes to the {{original}} framework, {{as well as the}} completion and integration of several data processing services. Initially, it was thought that a peer-to-peer architecture was necessary to make this work possible. The peer-to-peer architecture provided many benefits including the dynamic discovery of new services that would be continually added. A prototype example was built and while it showed promise, a major disadvantage was seen in that it was not easily integrated into the existing data environment. While the peer-to-peer system worked well for finding and accessing distributed data processing services, it was found that its use was limited by the difficulty in calling it from existing tools and services. After collaborations with members of the data community, it was determined that our data processing system was of high value and that a new interface should be pursued in order for the community {{to take full advantage of}} it. As such; the framework was modified from a peer-to-peer architecture to a more traditional web service approach. Following this change multiple data processing services were added. These services include such things as coordinate transformations and sub setting of data. Observatory (VHO), assisted with integrating the new architecture into the VHO. This allows anyone using the VHO to search for data, to then pass that data through our processing services prior to downloading it. As a second attempt at demonstrating the new system, a collaboration was established with the Collaborative Sun <b>Earth</b> <b>Connector</b> (CoSEC) group at Lockheed Martin. This group is working on a graphical user interface to the Virtual Observatories and data processing software. The intent is to provide a high-level easy-to-use graphical interface that will allow access to the existing Virtual Observatories and data processing services from one convenient application. Working with the CoSEC group we provided access to our data processing tools from within their software. This now allows the CoSEC community to take advantage of our services and also demonstrates another means of accessing our system...|$|E
5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral <b>connector.</b> <b>Earth</b> were {{provided}} via the shield. The connectors {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmilj√∂verket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|R
