5|$|<b>Days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> Morrow {{exposed a}} {{contract}} {{approved by the}} state Board of Control to purchase cloth from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to the allegation by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding {{on behalf of his}} brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only three <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2007 Folkvord {{announced}} he would seek another term in the City Council. Folkvord was re-elected lead candidate for the municipal election at the party convention. In March 2007 the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party merged and established Red. By 3 September, six <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> day, Red earned its best showing ever in Oslo earning 4.4% in an opinion poll — an increase of 0.3% from the previous election. When the votes for the municipality of Oslo were counted the party had managed to gain three seats on the City Council, with Folkvord's position secure. At national level Red had received 1.9% and 2.1% for the municipal and county elections respectively.|$|E

The English version was published as a hard cover by McClelland & Stewart while the French version was released by Montreal publishers, Les Editions de l'Homme, as a trade paperback. According to La Presse, 17,000 copies were printed; 5,000 sold {{in the first two}} weeks. In the Montreal market, the book was listed on the bestseller list at No. 6 for two weeks while the French version spent one week at No. 5.|$|E
5|$|Vice President Sherman {{had been}} renominated at Chicago; seriously ill during the campaign, he died six <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and was {{replaced}} on the ticket {{by the president of}} Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler. But few electors chose Taft and Butler, who won only Utah and Vermont, for a total of eight electoral votes. Roosevelt won 88, and Wilson 435. Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined. Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote, but finished with just under 3.5 million, over 600,000 less than the former president. Taft was not on the ballot in California, due to the actions of local Progressives, nor in South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa {{announced}} that lawyers acting {{on behalf of}} several opposition parties concerned about the credibility of the general election would approach the Electoral Court following the IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula's refusal to agree to their call for her resignation. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling.|$|E

5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{believed that}} the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election. In New York, Blaine received less support than he anticipated when Arthur and Conkling, still powerful in the New York Republican party, failed to actively campaign for him. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine’s mother was Irish Catholic, and he believed his career-long opposition to the British government would resonate with the Irish. Blaine’s hope for Irish defections to the Republican standard were dashed late in the campaign when one of his supporters, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech denouncing the Democrats as the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.” The Democrats spread the word of this insult in the <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> and Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by just over one thousand votes. While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219–182.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>election.</b> The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
