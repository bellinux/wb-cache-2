5|$|A {{personal}} highlight for Federer {{came near}} the end of the season when he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss <b>Indoors</b> in Basel, Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Murray beat Tim Henman {{in their}} first meeting, at the Basel Swiss <b>Indoors</b> in the first round, and {{eventually}} reached the quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Curfew. Impose {{a curfew}} on {{specified}} persons, designating that they stay <b>indoors</b> or {{within a particular}} area between certain hours, unless they obtain a permit to the contrary issued by a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012, zoo {{customers}} were herded <b>indoors</b> when a Heck bull escaped from its enclosure. The 600kg animal with three feet long horns was loose for over 40 minutes, until zoo workers and vets managed to restrain him by using tranquilliser darts.|$|E
5|$|Indoor netball is a {{variation}} of netball, played exclusively <b>indoors,</b> in which the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 2010, Jean-Michel Jarre {{started the}} second leg of his 2009–10 <b>Indoors</b> tour; on 10 June, he was {{presented}} with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Mojo magazine.|$|E
5|$|Set during autumn, Through the Looking-Glass {{begins with}} Alice <b>indoors</b> as she {{plays with the}} kittens of her pet cat, Dinah. Through a mirror, she travels to the {{alternative}} world behind the mirror, where chess pieces are alive. Encountering various characters, she eventually becomes a queen, and attends a party celebrating her coronation, although it quickly grows chaotic. Grabbing and shaking the Red Queen, Alice awakens back <b>indoors,</b> holding one of the kittens. The novel concludes with Alice's speculation {{on whether or not}} it was her dream or the Red King's.|$|E
5|$|As Faxai {{approached}} Japan, All Nippon Airways canceled day flights between Tokyo and the Izu Islands. Tokai Kisen, {{which operates}} ferries between Tokyo, the Izu Islands, and Shizuoka Prefecture, canceled some services {{due to the}} storm. Areas around Tokyo were notified of the expected heavy rains, waves up to 6m (19.6ft), and high winds. Residents were advised to stay <b>indoors</b> during the storm, especially after sunset, and to avoid possible flying debris.|$|E
5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, {{most people}} were already {{residing}} at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars to be off the roads during the storm and for people to remain <b>indoors.</b> Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{returned}} to competition in June 2006, and won gold with his teammates in the 4×100m at the 2006 European Championships. He tried other sports, including a spell with the Hamburg Sea Devils of the NFL Europa league and a rugby league trial with Castleford. Sprinting success came over 60m {{when he won}} silver at the 2008 World Indoor Championships, gold at the 2009 European <b>Indoors,</b> and became world champion at the 2010 World Indoor Championships.|$|E
5|$|Figure skating {{was first}} contested as an Olympic sport at the 1908 Summer Olympics, in London, United Kingdom. As this {{traditional}} winter sport could be conducted <b>indoors,</b> the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved its {{inclusion in the}} Summer Olympics program. It was featured a second time at the Antwerp Games, after which it was permanently transferred to the program of the Winter Olympic Games, first held in 1924 in Chamonix, France.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Simon Corble {{created an}} {{adaptation}} with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors' Company. performed as walkabout productions {{in the summer}} 1992 at Thurstaston Common and Beeston Castle and in August 1995 at Brimham Rocks, North Yorkshire. Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced <b>indoors</b> at the O'Reilly Theatre, Oxford in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, most {{citizens}} remained <b>indoors</b> {{during the}} passage of the hurricane. One police officer noted that even the criminals stayed home. In the Lewiston area, restaurants experienced a great surge in business. During the power outage after the storm, several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generator.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the recent}} public art in this area was bequeathed to the London School of Economics in 2005 by Louis Odette, a Canadian alumnus of the university, who also founded the Windsor Sculpture Park in Windsor, Ontario. He bequeathed a total of 13 works, mainly by Canadian sculptors, to the institution. Not all of those works are within the remit of this list, as some are {{situated}} <b>indoors</b> or in the adjacent borough of Camden.|$|E
5|$|Nødnett ensures 100% {{coverage}} of populated and surrounding areas, which exceeds {{any of the}} existing GSM networks. This includes good coverage <b>indoors,</b> to aid fire fighters, as well as full {{coverage of}} the coastline and coverage up to 2,500meters (8,000ft) height for aircraft. Nødnett gives full coverage along all national and county roads. The system also allows interoperability towards the maritime radio. The network also allows for transmission of data at a speed of 12-13 kbit/s.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} <b>indoors</b> usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of the stage were used during the tour. The first two legs of 1992 were <b>indoors</b> and used {{the smallest of the}} sets, which included fourVidiwalls (Philips-branded giant television screens); sixpainted Trabants suspended above the stage; 36television monitors; and a B-stage, a small remote platform connected to the main stage by a ramp. A seventh Trabant by the B-stage doubled as a DJ booth and a mirror ball.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling <b>indoors</b> and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|States of {{emergencies}} were {{declared in}} Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey {{due to the}} storm. Hermine affected {{the east coast of}} the United States during the busy Labor Day weekend, causing many beaches to be closed in Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Amtrak canceled or altered train lines due to the threat from the storm. In Savannah, Georgia, Bacon Fest was cancelled, and a beer fest was moved <b>indoors.</b> In Charleston, South Carolina, the city government provided 3,000sandbags to residents, preparing {{less than a year after}} damaging floods hit the state. Outer Banks ferry service was cancelled and bridges in Dare County, North Carolina, were closed due to the high winds. Officials deployed or readied swift water teams, helicopters, and the North Carolina National Guard in the eastern portion of the state. The Virginia National Guard utilized 270members to help prepare for the storm's potential flooding and power outages. A Bruce Springsteen concert in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was postponed two days, and several performances for the town's American Music Festival were cancelled or moved <b>indoors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built <b>indoors,</b> with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time <b>indoors,</b> near infected people, and specifically children at school. There is some controversy {{over the role of}} low body temperature as a risk factor for the common cold; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|The ride, though <b>indoors,</b> {{would close}} in {{any type of}} rain. Because of leaks in the structure, water pooled in the trough, warranting a shutdown. Typically, the ride would remain shut down {{after a period of}} rain as the crew would have to cycle several trains through the circuit in order for it to dry. Although the ride was enclosed, the storage track {{remained}} outdoors with a large door that opened when the storage track was needed.|$|E
5|$|The system {{consists}} of 101 stations, of which 17 are underground or <b>indoors.</b> The only underground {{station on the}} pre-metro western network was Nationaltheatret, {{and most of the}} underground station are in the common tunnel under the city center, or in shorter tunnel sections on the eastern network; in particular the Furuset Line runs mainly underground, with all but Haugerud built in or at the opening of a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The unusually heavy smog {{was evident}} {{to the crowd}} of one million onlookers at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Tabloids and {{newspapers}} that ordinarily ran front-page stories about the parade instead carried stories about the smog. Health officials cautioned those with chronic lung diseases to stay <b>indoors</b> and advised patients that symptoms of pollution-related illness usually lagged 24 hours after exposure.|$|E
5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held <b>indoors</b> due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E
5|$|At the Shanghai Masters, Federer {{captured}} {{his third}} Masters {{title of the}} season, defeating world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final. This was Federer's fifth straight victory over Nadal in their rivalry and his 94th career title, drawing him level with 2nd-placed Ivan Lendl. During the indoor season, Federer defeated Juan Martin Del Potro in the final of his hometown tournament, the Swiss <b>Indoors</b> in Basel, earning a record eighth championship there and winning his 95th career title, surpassing Ivan Lendl in number of career titles.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively <b>indoors.</b>|$|E
5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game <b>indoors,</b> the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being {{more or less the}} number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog turtles <b>indoors</b> in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when <b>indoors,</b> but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place <b>indoors</b> in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{finished}} {{the year in}} strong form, winning indoor titles at the Stockholm Open, Swiss <b>Indoors,</b> and the ATP World Tour Finals in London, which brought his tally to 66 career titles. Federer won the year-end championships in London by beating rival Rafael Nadal for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. It remains the only tournament in his career where Federer defeated all fellow members of the Big Four. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 34–4. Federer {{finished in the top}} two for the eighth consecutive season.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set <b>indoors</b> in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found {{a house in the}} residential area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E
5|$|In October, Del Potro {{reached the}} final of the 2013 Shanghai Rolex Masters, {{defeating}} Philipp Kohlschreiber, Tommy Haas, Nicolás Almagro, and Rafael Nadal (for {{the first time since the}} semifinals of the 2009 US Open) en route, but eventually losing to defending champion Novak Djokovic in a third-set tiebreak. Later, he beat Roger Federer at the 2013 Swiss <b>Indoors</b> in the final, his fourth title of the year. However, lost to Federer at the 2013 BNP Paribas Masters and in a winner-take-all, round-robin clash in the 2013 ATP World Tour Finals. He finished the year with a 51–16 record, winning four titles overall and $4,294,039. Del Potro was named Argentina's Sportsman of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In October, del Potro beat {{qualifier}} Grega Žemlja {{to win the}} Erste Bank Open in Vienna. He then beat Roger Federer to win the Swiss <b>Indoors</b> title, in Basel. The following week, {{he suffered}} a third-round loss to Michaël Llodra at the BNP Paribas Masters. During the round-robin stage of the ATP World Tour Finals, he won two of his three matches and qualified for the semifinals, where he was defeated by Djokovic in three sets, after leading by a set and a break.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use <b>indoors</b> or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
