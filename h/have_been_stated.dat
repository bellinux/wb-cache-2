5|$|The {{casus belli}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>stated</b> as a Burmese attempt {{to expand their}} {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Siamese incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. The war, according to the Burmese, began in January 1547 when Siamese forces conquered the frontier town of Tavoy (Dawei). Later in the year, the Burmese forces led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein retook the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy. Next year, in October 1548, three Burmese armies led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Bayinnaung invaded Siam through the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces penetrated up to the capital city of Ayutthaya but could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. But the Burmese negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the return of two important Siamese nobles (the heir apparent Prince Ramesuan, and Prince Thammaracha of Phitsanulok) whom they had captured.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{some critics}} raised the {{possibility}} that Heller's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein's 1950 novel, Face of a Hero. Falstein never raised the issue between Catch-22s publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to {{have been aware of}} the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by Céline, Waugh and Nabokov. Many of the similarities <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>stated</b> to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II.

500|$|The {{war began}} in 1547. The casus belli <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>stated</b> {{as an attempt}} by Toungoo Dynasty of Burma to expand its {{territory}} eastwards after a political crisis in Ayutthaya {{as well as an}} attempt to stop Ayutthaya's incursions into the upper Tenasserim coast. According to the Burmese chronicles, a Siamese force of 6000 had occupied Tavoy (Dawei) in the Upper Tenasserim coast, which he considered his territory, by January 1547. As frontiers in the pre-modern period were less defined and often overlapped, the [...] "occupation" [...] may have been an attempt by Ayutthaya to reinforce the frontier town, which was claimed by Toungoo. At any rate, Tabinshwehti sent a sizable force of 12,000 (8000 army, 4000 navy) led by Saw Lagun Ein, viceroy of Martaban, to take over Tavoy c. October/November 1547. A joint land-naval attack on Tavoy drove out the Siamese forces led by the Lord of Kanchanaburi to lower Tenasserim.|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>stated</b> by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
