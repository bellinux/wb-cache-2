In 1992, a chicane was added making it 3021 metres (1.88 miles) long, then in 1996 a new renovated track was introduced (a <b>fast</b> <b>bend</b> to replace a sharp corner {{at the end of}} the pit straight) which shortened the total length by 24 metres (0.02 miles). The average F1 lap speed is over 160 km/h and the F1 top speed is 290 km/h. As Fiorano is a testing track, it has a wide range of corner types, with corner diameters between 370 m and 13.71 m. Thus Ferrari is able to simulate corner and track types of other Grand Prix circuits.|$|E

Four DC motors drive the mechanism. Its control system comprises a computer, hardware servo-systems and power amplifiers. The locomotion of the prototype is planar curvet gait. In the double support our prototype is statically stable and over actuated. In the single support it is unstable and under actuated system. There is no flight phase.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{offered by}} variable resistance bend sensors, applied as wearable devices on body garments, to recover human joint bend angles for body segment movement tracking, have been investigated, underlying their advantages and drawbacks in real-time applications. Due to their pliability, sensitivity, and cheapness, {{they could be}} a valid alternative to movement analysis systems, based on optoelectronic devices or inertial electronic sensors. This paper suggests a new method for sensor characterization under <b>fast</b> <b>bend</b> and extension movements, to extract few parameters of a synthetic model, which provide to the users the chance to foresee their electrical performance in different applications. The sensor and their extracted models were applied to register the human knee rotation during a gait cycle, either at slow speed (83 deg/s) for a walking pattern at 5 km/h, and at high speed (650 deg/s) for a running pattern of a sprinter at 10 m/s, and finally the finger joint rotations at their maximum angular velocity (900 deg/s). This was done for a twofold purpose: from one hand, to assess the model capability to predict the sensor performance, tracking human body segment rotations at different speed, without the need of measurement; from the other hand, to recover in real time the actual sensor rotation from its resistance measurement, especially in high speed applications, where its response is distorted.

IPMC samples in sulfonic forms having sodium as cations are prepared, their electromechanical properties are characterized, and their actuation responses to various electric stimuli are investigated.

40|$|Recently, the rebar bending {{methodology}} {{started to}} change from field processing to utilizing rebar bending machines at plant sites prior to transport to the construction locations. Computerized control of rebar plant bending machines provides more accurate and <b>faster</b> <b>bending</b> of rebars than the low quality inefficient field processing alternative. The bending process involves plastic deformation of rebars, where bending stress beyond the yield point of the material is applied. When the bending stress is removed, spring back {{is caused by the}} elastic restoring stress. Therefore, an accurate numerical analysis of the spring-back process is required to reduce the bending process errors. The most sensitive factors affecting the spring-back process are the bending radius, the bending angle, the diameter of the rebar, the friction coefficient, and the yielding strength of material. In this paper, we suggest a numerical modeling method using these factors. The finite element modeling of the dynamic mechanical behavior of the material during bending is performed using a commercial dynamic analysis program “DAFUL. ” We use the least squares approach to derive the spring-back deflection {{as a function of the}} rebar bending parameters...|$|R

40|$|Swimming-type robotic {{fish are}} being {{developed}} as mobile sensor platforms that {{have the potential to}} outperform existing underwater vehicles in terms of manoeuvrability, miniaturisation and silent operation. Conducting polymer actuators are potential candidates for propelling a flapping tail fin for a robotic fish. This study introduces a method for directly measuring the thrust force generated by a polypyrrole (PPy) powered tail fin. The effects of voltage stimulus (waveform shape and frequency) and tail fin shape on the thrust force were determined. A square wave voltage input was shown to generate the highest thrust forces as <b>fast</b> <b>bending</b> actuation was induced. The thrust force tended to decrease at higher operating frequencies {{as a result of the}} reduced actuation occurring in the PPy layers. Increases in the tail fin area tended to lower the frequency where the peak in thrust force was achieved. Tail fin shape was also shown to be important to the force-frequency behaviour. When attached to an untethered robotic fish, the swimming speed tended to increase with increasing voltage input frequency. There was also an optimum frequency that enabled the fastest acceleration from rest that happened to be higher than the frequency that gave the peak thrust force. This was presumed to be due to the complicated swimming behaviour involving the side-to-side movement of the fish nose at low flap frequencies. The study provides valuable insight into the means for tailoring polymer actuator performance to achieve maximum fish swimming speeds...|$|R

40|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) {{consist of}} a perfluorinated ionomer membrane (usually Nafion ® or Flemion®). The ionomer is plated on both faces with a noble metal such as gold or platinum. It is neutralized {{with a certain amount}} of counterions that balance the electrical charge of anions covalently fixed to the backbone membrane. IPMCs are electroactive materials that can be used as actuators and sensors. Their electrical-chemical-mechanical response is highly dependent on the cations used, the nature and the amount of solvent uptake, the morphology of the electrodes, and other factors. When a cantilever strip of solvated Nafion-based IPMC sample is subjected to a suddenly applied and sustained (DC) electric potential of several volts (1 - 3 V) across its faces, it bends towards the anode. For Nafion-based IPMCs with alkali metals, actuation towards the anode is followed by a slow back relaxation towards the cathode. If the electric potential is removed and the two electrodes are shorted during this back relaxation, the sample displays a <b>fast</b> <b>bending</b> deformation towards the cathode and then slowly relaxes back towards the anode, attaining a new equilibrium position generally distinct from its initial state. One way to change various phases of IPMC actuation is achieved by changing input potential. The electric potential inputs may be used to control the actuation of IPMCs.

At more moderate British road speeds, we have managed 43mpg in mixed running with four people aboard." [...] In this review the car was viewed as being superior to a BMW 5-series: [...] "Early in the trip the car was uncannily smooth over the bumpy back roads between Calais and Dunkirk. On German autobahns, travelling at speeds which turn bends into corners, the XM remained impressively flat as the suspension altered to cope with high cornering loads. We made the trip accompanied by a BMW 535i, which rolled appreciably more through <b>fast</b> <b>bends,</b> and passengers who tried both cars preferred the XM." [...] Points of criticism were again, the left-side mirror and rear headroom: [...] " [...] The most serious problem is ungenerous rear headroom, though three passengers of average height found the rear bench comfortable for a 12-hour journey. More irritating, because avoidable, is the nearside mirror, which is partially obscured by the A-pillar. This deficiency is particularly noticeable on the continent, when you need the mirror for overtaking." [...] The foot-operated parking brake was also criticized: [...] "... four days weren’t enough to dispel our annoyance with the US-style foot-operated parking brake. We noted sourly that you would probably fail a driving test in the XM, because you cannot apply the brake (using your left foot) until you have put the car in neutral." [...] In conclusion, CARs view was that [...] "the XM is a car that grows on you, and in Turbo Diesel form, its cheap to operate. If youre contemplating high mileages, particularly abroad where diesel is sensibly priced much cheaper than petrol, it’s well worth considering the stiff extra price of the oil-burner. If you care about reducing carbon dioxide emissions by improving fuel consumption, the XM Turbo Diesel offers dramatic gains without sacrificing big-car virtues." ...|$|R
