Because of the Bernoulli effect, they may also exert upward or downward forces on structural surfaces and can induce the vibration of wire lines and pipelines.

30|$|Under <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> column {{may be in}} {{different}} working states. If the external <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> is zero, column will not move, which is named as “full compression without slip”. Under cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> such as earthquake and wind, if the external force {{is less than the}} friction force at column foot, there is no relative displacement between column and stone base. Column foot transfer seismic energy all from the bottom of structure to upper structure. Column will rotate under the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> which is named as “column rocking without slip”. If the external force is larger than the friction force at column foot, slip will appear to the column foot. Column will rotate under the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> which is named as “column rocking with slip”. At this working state, the shear force at column foot is equal to the friction force according to the horizontal force equilibrium equation. And, the load transferred from the bottom of column foot to upper structure is same with friction force, which plays an obvious seismic isolation effects. After seismic load, column may be in a new state with irreclaimable slip, which is named as “full compression with slip”. During column rocking, if the restoring moment is less than the external moment, column will overturn, which is named as “column overturning”. Therefore, with the combined effects of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads,</b> column may be in five possible working states: (a) full compression without slip; (b) full compression with slip; (c) column rocking without slip; (d) column rocking with slip and (e) column overturning. The force systems of column in working states (a) and (b) are clear. While the force systems of column in working states (c) and (d) under seismic load are not clear, which should be studied further.|$|R

The estimated collapse load values obtained for the single panel are used to make some predictions about the load capacity of a masonry wall subjected to both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{barricade}} webbing {{consists of}} {{upper and lower}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>loading</b> straps joined to {{each other at the}} ends. Five vertical engaging straps, spaced 20 feet apart, are connected to each upper and lower load strap. The barricade webbing is raised to a height of approximately 20 feet. The barricade webbing engages the wings of the landing aircraft, wherein energy is transmitted from the barricade webbing through the purchase cable to the arresting engine. Following a barricade arrestment, the webbing and deck cables are discarded and the stanchions are lowered back into their recessed slots. Barricade engagements are rare, as tailhooks are designed to be extremely fail-safe, and an aircraft returning from combat with such severe damage would likely not be able to land. This device has been installed on all American aircraft carriers and on the French Charles de Gaulle while Brazilian CATOBAR, Russian and Indian STOBAR aircraft carriers have only conventional arresting gear installed.|$|E

50|$|MIT (Metrocargo Intermodal Transport) is {{a project}} partly funded by the European Union under the Programme “Research {{for the benefit of}} SMEs“ - Call ID “FP7-SME-2011” and managed by REA Research Executive Agency.Metrocargo is a concept of {{intermodal}} shipment based on <b>horizontal</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading containers and swap bodies on standard flatbed wagons under the overhead electric feeding line. The system being fully automated and very efficient, it is time and cost effective for the distributed intermodal transport over a territory and for processing full trains in port to dry port shuttling. The promoters constructed a full-scale prototype unit and the EC-funded research pro-ject VIT Vision for Innovative Transport successfully researched the remaining technical issues. This MIT Metrocargo Intermodal Transport project is about bringing Metrocargo from research to market stage and promoting its dissemination among logistic decision-makers throughout Europe. Technically, MIT will implement specific technical improvements and the scaling up from single prototypal unit to full industrial installation, developing typical plant design and SW applications to automate and optimise the work flow and provide interfaces with operators and external systems. Promotion and dissemination will be the main goal, carrying out market studies in several EU member states and subsequent market plans to exploit the Metrocargo features in terms of installation and operating costs, limited use of dock area, safety and environmental impact. Economic advantages to operators in typical situations will be deter-mined effecting specific feasibility studies. Dissemination events will be organised centred on the full scale Metrocargo prototype installed in the port of Vado Ligure. The SMEs will exhibit the system in main logistic and transport shows in Europe and will organise road-show presentations in several countries, using videos and a dynamic simulation SW tool to illustrate the solutions for specific needs. At the end of this Project the Metrocargo technology will be a fully developed market-ready system that will be widely known among European logistic decision makers.|$|E

40|$|Simplified {{method of}} {{analysis}} for the structural response of a regular multi-story frame to combined constant vertical and monotonically increasing <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads</b> have been investigated. Complete elasto-plastic analysis of the frame is carried out by separating the frame {{into a number of}} subframes and performing piecewise elastic analysis on each subframe making use of the load increment technique. For a subframe considered, rotation angles at joints in the same floor are assumed to be identical, and this makes the formulation of the governing equation simple, which is derived from the slope-deflection equations in view of the equilibrium conditions. Two possible avenues of approach to solve the joint rotations from the governing equation {{at all levels of the}} frame are presented. The validity of the Merchant-Rankine formula has been verified from the results obtained in the parametric study, and the use of it to determine the maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> is illustrated.

40|$|More than 25 {{bathymetry}} profiles {{have been}} used to examine the flexure of the Pacific lithosphere seaward of the Izu-Bonin and Mariana trenches. Selected bathymetry profiles have been corrected for the effects of sediment loading and compared to simple elastic and elastic-plastic models for lithospheric flexure seaward of these trenches. Profiles of the northern Mariana trench, where the seaward wall is relatively gentle, can be explained by a simple elastic model without an applied <b>horizontal</b> <b>load.</b> Profiles of the Izu-Bonin and southern Mariana trenches, where the seaward wall is relatively steep, can be explained by an elastic-plastic model with an applied load of 4. 0 - 6. 0 kbar, depending on the uniform yield stress assumed. If it is assumed the yield stress varies with depth the <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> required is significantly reduced (≲ 2. 5 kbar). The magnitude of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> cannot be determined with certainty, however, since it is not known how the yield stress may vary with depth.
