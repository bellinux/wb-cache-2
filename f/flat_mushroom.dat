40|$|The clinicopathologic {{case of a}} 53 -year-old female {{patient with}} an {{abnormal}} tumor growing on the mucous part of the superior right eyelid is reported. The patient was operated on for ten years ago and a whitish mass slowly developed on the conjunctival face of the eyelid disturbing the use of corneal lenses. It was hard, painless and had {{the shape of a}} <b>flat</b> <b>mushroom.</b> The removal was performed under local anesthesia and allowed us to resect a hard and fibrous lesion. Histopathology showed that the lesion was made of a fibrous tissue organized like a hypertrophic scar. Surgical treatment of chalazion is frequent and rarely gives rise to abnormal scarring...|$|E

This system was so called due to the peculiar formation of rods around the column head and the rapidity with which they could be erected. Between 1906 and 1909, at least eighteen other buildings of this type {{were built in the}} U.S.A.|$|R
50|$|Ganoderma tsugae, {{also known}} as Hemlock varnish shelf, is a <b>flat</b> polypore <b>mushroom</b> of the genus Ganoderma. In {{contrast}} to Ganoderma lucidum, {{to which it is}} closely related and which it closely resembles, G. tsugae tends to grow on conifers, especially hemlocks. Like G. lucidum, G. tsugae is said to have medicinal properties. Phylogenetic analysis has begun to better differentiate between many closely related species of Ganoderma; however, there is still disagreement as to which have the most medicinal properties. In addition, variations within the same species as well as the growth substrate and environmental conditions all the way through to preparation can have a substantial effect on the medicinal value of the product. Like G. lucidum, G. tsugae is non-poisonous but generally considered inedible, because of its solid woody nature; however, teas and extracts made from its fruiting bodies allow medicinal use of the compounds it contains. A hot water extraction or tea can be very effective for extracting the polysaccharides; however, an alcohol or alcohol/glycerin extraction method is more effective for the triterpenoids.|$|R
5000|$|Crawford {{held the}} Australian patent {{rights for the}} Turner <b>Mushroom</b> <b>flat</b> slab system. This system was so called due to the {{peculiar}} formation of rods around the column head and the rapidity with which they could be erected. It was first described in the U.S.A. in Engineering News in 1905 by C.A.P. Turner and his first flat-slab building was the Johnson-Bovey building of 1906. Some of these buildings still exist and at least one, the 1906 Hoffman (a.k.a. Marshall) building was designated an ASCE National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 2002. Between 1906 and 1909, at least eighteen other buildings of this type {{were built in the}} U.S.A.|$|R
