Since 2014, the company has used other venues for its New York seasons.

2500|$|In the {{differential}} form formulation on arbitrary space times, [...] is the electromagnetic tensor {{considered as a}} 2-form, [...] is the potential 1-form, [...] is the current 3-form, [...] is the exterior derivative, and [...] is the Hodge star on forms defined (up to <b>its</b> <b>an</b> orientation, i.e. its sign) by the Lorentzian metric of spacetime. Note that in the special case of -forms such as F, the Hodge star [...] depends on the metric tensor only for its local scale. This means that, as formulated, {{the differential}} form field equations are conformally invariant, but the Lorenz gauge condition breaks conformal invariance. The operator [...] is the d'Alembert–Laplace–Beltrami operator on 1-forms on an arbitrary Lorentzian spacetime. The topological condition is again that the [...] second real cohomology group is trivial. By the isomorphism with the second de Rham cohomology this condition means that every closed 2-form is exact.|$|E

In contrast to many traditional high schools, CHS has been known for its small size, its open campus and downtown location, student participation in school governance and staff hiring, and loose attendance policies more similar to those of colleges than those at most high schools. The school has also eschewed many of the characteristics of traditional high schools, including interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, changing bells, mascots (aside from a rainbow-spangled zebra). [...] Although regular proms were not embraced until the 1990s, in 1974 an openly homosexual student, John Arden Rhyne, was named homecoming queen. [...] There was a small prom attended by part of the student body. [...] And Queen John was escorted by the winner of the third floor Euchre tournament.
