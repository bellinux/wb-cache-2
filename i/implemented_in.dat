The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would {{take a long time to}} run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
