The 167th Infantry Division, on the right flank of the 11th Panzer Division, also made sufficient progress, reaching Tirechnoe by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> By the end of 5 July, a wedge had been created in the first belt of the Soviet defences.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the {{employees}} confront Michael {{to hear about}} the surprise, but Michael's awkward stalling tactics cause them to finally realize there is no surprise, and they leave. With only him and Dwight left in the office, Dwight casually mentions to Michael what Jan said to him.|$|E
5|$|Gonen, {{starting}} to realise {{the gravity of}} Adan's position, ordered Sharon at 14:45 to pull back and return to his initial positions. The Erez Armored Brigade arrived to offer assistance to Keren, but poor coordination between the commanders led {{to the failure of}} further attempts to capture Hamutal Hill. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> Adan's division alone had lost around 100 tanks.|$|E

5|$|In the North, by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> 1. Kavalleriedivision {{had reached}} the line Meppel–Groningen, delayed by {{logistical}} problems and Dutch demolition teams blowing up 236 bridges. Dutch troop strength in that area was weak.|$|E
5|$|Ontario {{electricity}} outages were minor, mostly {{caused by}} the windstorms of April 28. Although they affected thousands of people at different times throughout the day, all power was restored by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours, and {{involved}} innovative tactics and technology. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the IAF had destroyed 29 of 30 SAM batteries {{deployed in the}} Beqaa Valley and shot down between 82–86 enemy aircraft with minimal losses. The battle led the United States to impose a ceasefire on Israel and Syria.|$|E

25|$|Western Railway {{services}} were restored on 11 July by 10.45pm. As a show <b>of</b> investor confidence, <b>the</b> Mumbai Stock Exchange rebounded, starting <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with <b>the</b> BSE Sensex Index up by nearly 1% in morning trade. Foreign investors also retained confidence, with the Sensex up almost 3% at 10,930.09 at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> trade.|$|R
25|$|As <b>the</b> fourth <b>day's</b> play {{started with}} India still 20 runs behind with just 6 wickets {{in hand and}} two full days of play left, another convincing win for Australia looked inevitable. However, what transpired on <b>Day</b> 4 etched <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> Laxman and Dravid in history forever. Laxman and Dravid batted out <b>the</b> entire <b>day</b> without getting dismissed. Steve Waugh used 9 bowlers, but Laxman and Dravid kept McGrath-Warne and company at bay and scored at will, {{completely}} dominating the bowling. India's score which was 254/4 at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play read 589/4 at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play. <b>The</b> duo added 335 runs on day 4 tumbling many records on the way. Dravid, having been under severe criticism for his previous failures in the series, celebrated his hundred in an uncharacteristic fashion gesturing at the press box. He remained unbeaten at 155 and Laxman at 276 at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play.|$|R
5|$|The four {{remaining}} North Korean pilots immediately {{retreated to}} the north. The aircraft likely staged at Pyongyang Air Base, and informed their superiors.

5|$|With Floyd's arrival to take {{command of}} Fort Donelson, Pillow took over leading the Confederate left. Feeling overwhelmed, Floyd left {{most of the}} actual command to Pillow and Buckner. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> there had been several skirmishes, but the {{positions}} of each side were essentially the same. The night progressed with both sides fighting the cold weather.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to the close first Test, <b>the</b> second match <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series was a much easier victory for England. Though losing their first three wickets for just 28 runs England managed 361 by the time their final wicket fell in the morning session on day two. Australia only managed a response of 128, their lowest total at Lord's since 1968, with the second innings <b>ending</b> before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play. With a lead of over 200 runs, England captain Alastair Cook had <b>the</b> option <b>of</b> making <b>the</b> Australians follow-on, but elected not to. In the third innings, Australia managed to reduce England to 30/3, but from then on, England were dominant, with Joe Root scoring 180 in 338 balls and 466 minutes at the crease. Immediately following Root's dismissal early on <b>the</b> fourth <b>day,</b> Cook declared at 349/7. England managed to dismiss Australia before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play, securing a 2–0 lead in the series.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> festivities, {{centered}} on the review, a massive firework display was held as a 'reconstruction' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Trafalgar (with Grand Turk standing in for HMS Victory, and with a red and a blue side rather than French and British ones), now known to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest firework displays in recorded history.|$|R
5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and that in {{four and a half years}} spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|And, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts {{will tell you that}} the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there are plenty of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially exactly the same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly (Mindy Kaling) develop crushes on Charles. They {{flirt with}} him, leaving him uncomfortable. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> Kelly puts on more makeup to tempt Charles into asking her out, {{but he has}} already left. Kelly runs out {{to the parking lot}} where she finds Angela holding Charles's scarf and starts chasing her. Angela {{mentions}} that Charles deserves better than Kelly.|$|E
25|$|During {{filming of}} a {{television}} documentary in the 1970s, crew attached a replica of Pearse's 1902 machine by a rope to a team <b>of</b> horses. When <b>the</b> horses bolted, the machine took to the air and flew, indicating that the design could fly. This did not get filmed, as the crew had packed away their cameras at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> shooting.|$|R

2500|$|Stumps is {{also used}} as a term to mean <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>day's</b> play, e.g. [...] "The umpires called stumps" [...] means that the umpires have {{declared}} play over for <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> [...] At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a session, i.e. before lunch or tea, the umpires will remove the bails; at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play, <b>the</b> umpires will also remove the stumps.|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing the last two games with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup.

5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, {{the boys would}} hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} other series, everybody's {{problems}} appear to be sorted out by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each episode. However, eccentric feudal landowner Lord Belborough orders everyone to <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> Winkstead Hall after the 6 o'clock whistle which sounds <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> work at <b>the</b> local biscuit factory. Belborough plays his vintage organ, while the workers gather for a dance and the episode fades out.|$|R
25|$|West Indies had {{to follow}} on 167 runs behind. Not long before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> play they had reached 97-2, but then Martin {{dismissed}} Kanhai, Sobers and Worrell - the latter two for ducks - to leave West Indies reeling at 99-5. Hunte, who had batted throughout, and Alexander took the score to 129 by the close, when the former had reached 74 not out.|$|R
5|$|Between Acton Town and Hammersmith, District line trains serve all stations, but Piccadilly line trains run {{non-stop}} to Hammersmith {{except for}} calling at Turnham Green {{at the start}} and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The run between Acton Town and Hammersmith spans nearly three miles – the longest distance between stops on the Piccadilly line. West of Acton Town, District line trains go via Ealing Common to Ealing Broadway and Piccadilly line trains run either via South Ealing to Heathrow, or via Ealing Common to Uxbridge.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in {{the city}} began to wind down on 14 March. The day was spent with the LSSAH {{clearing}} the remnants of Soviet resistance, pushing east along a broad front. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the entire city was declared {{to be back in}} German hands. Despite the declaration that the city had fallen, fighting continued on 15 and 16 March, as German units cleared the remnants of resistance in the tractor works factory complex, in the southern outskirts of the city.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when pattern dimes and quarters were struck, {{but this was}} most likely in mid-November 1891. One variety each of pattern dime and quarter are known, whereas five different half dollars are extant; all known Barber coin patterns are in the National Numismatic Collection and none are in private hands. On December 11, Bosbyshell requested a delay in production to mid-January 1892 to allow the dies to be more thoroughly tested; Leech refused. The first Barber coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on January 2, 1892 at 9:00a.m. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> all three denominations had been coined.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{function}} as a junction station, some long-distance services stopped at the station for a long time, most recently in the mid-1990s, when occasional InterRegio services stopped at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Since then, passenger operations have been limited to commuter services. The long-distance services have generally run over the newly built Weißig-Böhla railway since 2010 and thus bypass Coswig Station to the east.|$|R
50|$|A {{day order}} or good for <b>day</b> order (GFD) (<b>the</b> most common) {{is a market}} or limit order that is in force {{from the time the}} order is {{submitted}} to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day's</b> trading session. For stock markets, the closing time is defined by the exchange. For the foreign exchange market, this is until 5 p.m. EST/EDT for all currencies except the New Zealand Dollar.|$|R
25|$|Lawry and Stackpole {{started off}} {{cautiously}} for Australia against paceman Syed Abid Ali and the spin attack.
