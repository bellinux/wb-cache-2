5000|$|In 1849, B. Schäffer {{patented}} {{the design}} of a diaphragm <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> The following year he formed a business partnership with his brother-in-law C.F. Budenberg, The Schäffer & Budenberg Machinery & Boiler Fittings Company, in the altstadt of the Prussian town of Magdeburg Germany. They began manufacturing <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> and all items relating the steam industry. In 1858 they moved to purpose built premises on Schoenebecker Strasse in the suburb of Buckau. The company became known by the shorter name of The Schäffer & Budenberg Manufacturing Company (S&B) [...] "a special factory for the production of fine mechanical instruments". However, locally in Buckau they were always known as 'Schäffers'. Export success {{on the back of the}} every increasing steam industry led to the formation of manufacturing and sales subsidiaries all over the world. In c1875 the company produced its first Bourdon <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> thanks to the expiry of patents. They opened American Schäffer & Budenberg office & factory in Brooklyn, New York in 1876, and briefly a second factory in Foxboro, Massachusetts. They had 5 factories, 4 depots, 25 offices and numerous agencies over five continents by the beginning of WWI employing nearly 8,000.|$|R
40|$|The {{time capsule}} [Biological and Environmental Specimens Time Capsule] aims at {{the storage of}} {{biological}} and environmental data on contemporary earth until 1000 year future from now on. In {{order to make the}} samples kept in the capsule for ultra-long time useful in judging that of biological and environmental degradation of the earth comparing the data with 1000 year time difference, two conditions for the biological contents in the capsule are necessary they are: (1) oxygen free and (2) temperature below - 60 ℃, which should strictly be fulfilled for 1, 000 years. The ultra-long-term recorder has been developed which is energized by the stored energy of the materials. The time span [t] is regulated by the torsion creep behavior of pure copper. The pressure [P] in the capsule is to be monitored by a pen cylinder <b>type</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and temperature [T] by bimetal. All these three essential key values: P, T, in the capsule and time are to be recorded on the clean surface of metal plate with the scratch of the needles, which follows on each sensor. The extrapolation of the torsion creep data gives approximately 8 rotations on time scale shaft, which leads us to the 40 mm transverse motion of scratch needles during 1000 year [3 × 10 ^ sec] lapse of time...|$|R
50|$|Copper {{units of}} {{pressure}} or CUP, {{and the related}} lead units of pressure or LUP, are terms applied to pressure measurements used {{in the field of}} internal ballistics for the estimation of chamber pressures in firearms. These terms were adopted by convention to indicate that the pressure values were measured by copper crusher and lead crusher gauges respectively. In recent years, they have been replaced by the adoption of more modern piezoelectric <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> that more accurately measure chamber pressures and generally give significantly higher pressure values. This nomenclature was adopted to avoid confusion and the potentially dangerous interchange of pressure values and standards made by different <b>types</b> of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges.</b> <b>Pressure</b> is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter that is expressed in units of force divided by area. In the avoirdupois system, the units of pressure are pounds per square inch and in the metric system, the units or pressure are newtons per square meter (pascals). A chamber pressure measured with a copper crusher gauge would be expressed as psi (CUP) in the English system or MPa (CUP) in the metric system.|$|R
40|$|Pressure pulses {{caused by}} {{irradiation}} {{of a model}} {{gallium arsenide solar cell}} with a Carbon Dioxide TEA Laser were examined using power densities of the order of 10 7 watts/cm 2. The pressure pulses were monitored with a Sandia <b>type</b> quartz <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> It was discovered that the relatively low power densities used were capable of removing the silicon dioxide antireflective and gold contact layers of the solar cell after only a few shots of the laser. An exponential relationship between the initial thicknesses of these layers and the pressure pulse generated in the gallium arsenide substrate was indicated for gold contact layers of less than 5000 A thickness. Evidence was found that the principal pressure generation mechanism is thermomechanical. Gold films of thickness greater than 5000 A were found to be able to absorb the power densities used with no apparent damage. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vacuum system set-up is {{presented}} {{and used for}} calibration of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{in the region of}} rough vacuum, from 103 mbar to 10 - 1 mbar, with dry air. The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R

The displacements of sea ice were measured at two places which were respectively located at 20 m (P 20 M) and 60 m (P 60 M) offshore of bench mark BM No. 1040. The displacement at P 20 M, where the sea ice {{is close to the}} fast ice, showed strong non-linear behavior in both amplitude and phase compared with the ocean tide measured by the bottom-pressure gauge. On the other hand the displacement at P 60 M was very consistent with the observed ocean tide. According to the 6 measurements made at P 60 M in the 8 months from May to December, 1993,the differences in amplitude are less than 5 % as represented by the ratio of the displacement of the sea ice to the ocean tide...|$|R
