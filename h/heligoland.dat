5|$|After her commissioning, München was {{employed}} as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless telegraphy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the ship {{was assigned to the}} High Seas Fleet. She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister-ship , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914. That morning, the British attacked the German patrol line in the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. During the ensuing Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight, München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders. At 12:25, the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser , but at 14:06, München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north-east of <b>Heligoland.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ariadne {{served with}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet {{for the majority of}} her career. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was used to patrol the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. On 28 August, the British Royal Navy attacked the patrol line, and in the ensuing Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight, a pair of battlecruisers attacked and sank Ariadne. Some 200 of her crew were killed in the battle; only 59 survivors were pulled from the sea.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 May, the two squadrons {{encountered}} each other off the island of <b>Heligoland,</b> then controlled by neutral Great Britain. Tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while the slower Prussian vessels lagged behind, unable to effectively engage the Danish warships. Tegetthoff's flagship, Schwarzenberg, bore {{the brunt of the}} Danish gunfire and caught fire three times, the last of which could not be put out quickly and forced Tegetthoff to seek shelter in the neutral waters around <b>Heligoland.</b> Though Denmark claimed a tactical victory in the battle, the Danes were forced to end the blockade of the German coast. An armistice came into effect three days after the Battle of <b>Heligoland.</b> By the time fighting broke out again in June, further Austrian warships had arrived to strengthen the Austro-Prussian naval forces, and the Danes did not seek to challenge them.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, on 28 August 1914, Moltke participated in the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Six German light cruisers—, , , , , and —responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. However, the arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in November 1917, Derfflinger sailed from port {{to assist}} the German light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, {{but by the time}} she and the other battlecruisers arrived on the scene, the British raiders had fled northward.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the war the Royal Air Force (RAF) mostly focused its bomber attacks against anti-shipping {{operations}} on the German Bight. RAF bombers mounted a heavy attack against shipping off Wilhelmshaven on 18 December 1939 in what became {{to be known as the}} Battle of the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Twenty-four twin-engine Vickers Wellington from No. 9 Squadron, No. 37 Squadron and No. 149 Squadron formed up over Norfolk heading for the island of <b>Heligoland.</b> Two aircraft aborted the mission due to mechanical defects, but the remaining 22 pursued the attack and were spotted by a Freya radar on the East Frisian Islands.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were {{attempting}} to clear British-laid minefields in the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand {{was attached to the}} 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. New Zealand did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms were}} {{transmitted}} to Germany on 12 November 1918, instructing {{them to make}} the High Seas Fleet ready to sail by 18 November, or the Allies would occupy <b>Heligoland.</b>|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, {{she served}} with the II Scouting Group, part of the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She was assigned to patrols off the island of <b>Heligoland</b> at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914. At the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Mainz was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered a much stronger force of British cruisers and destroyers. They scored several damaging hits with gunfire and a torpedo that disabled Mainz and prompted her commander to abandon ship. The British rescued 348 men from the crew before the ship rolled over and sank. Eighty-nine men were killed in the battle, including her commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} four sister ships, , , , and , Kaiserin participated {{in all of}} the major fleet {{operations}} of World War I, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 Mayand 1 June 1916. The ship was also involved in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, in October 1917. She later saw action during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in November 1917.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in August 1914, Augsburg was deployed to the Baltic, while Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln remained in the North Sea. The three ships were assigned to patrol duty in the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight; on 28 August 1914, they were attacked during the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Mainz and Cöln were both sunk in the battle. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, and joined Augsburg for the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. Both ships also saw service during Operation Albion in October 1917. Both ships survived the war; Kolberg was ceded to France, where she was renamed Colmar and served in the French Navy until 1927. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan and was then sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of <b>Heligoland</b> at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Cöln was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in the haze. She inadvertently turned back toward them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E
5|$|The 21 {{remaining}} Sea Kings are tasked to {{a variety}} of roles including SAR, transport, disaster relief, tactical land–sea transport, evacuation, surveillance, reconnaissance and naval support. The main base is Nordholz, although units are always stationed at <b>Heligoland</b> Airport and Warnemünde, and sometimes at Borkum Airfield. The helicopters are scheduled to be replaced by the NH-90.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of war saw {{conflict}} in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by battlecruisers at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight and Battle of Dogger Bank, and raids on the English coast. In May 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets on 31 May to 1 June in the indecisive Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|The sister ships {{spent the}} rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea; they {{provided}} distant cover during Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in 1917. In 1920 they were put into reserve and were then sold for scrap a few years later in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922.|$|E
5|$|Fearless and the 1st DF {{saw nothing}} {{during that same}} patrol. She damaged two German light cruisers during the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight later in August. The {{squadron}} provided close cover for the seaplane carriers of the Harwich Force during the Cuxhaven Raid in late December, but the cruiser was only engaged by several Zeppelins and aircraft without effect. The ship {{was transferred to the}} Grand Fleet in early 1915 and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland the following year.|$|E
5|$|Frauenlob {{spent her}} entire {{career in the}} {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She saw action during World War I at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in August 1914, where she badly damaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. There, in a chaotic night engagement, Frauenlob {{was hit by a}} torpedo launched by , which caused the ship to capsize and sink with the vast majority of her crew. The wreck was discovered in 2000, and is in remarkably good condition, sitting upright on the ocean floor.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glorious was {{the second}} of the three s built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord, Lord Fisher, they were {{relatively}} lightly armed and armoured. Glorious was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.|$|E
5|$|Historians' {{opinions}} {{on the outcome of}} the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff's ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. Jylland is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, KzS von Karpf left Moltke; KzS Gygas assumed {{command of}} the ship. Between September and October 1917, the ship took part in Operation Albion {{supporting}} the German invasion of the Russian islands of Ösel, Dagö, and Moon (in present-day Estonia). Following the successful operation in the Baltic, Moltke was detached to support the II Reconnaissance Group (II AG), but did not actively participate in the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} invasion, the RAF {{intensified}} {{its operations}} against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying naval mines from April, and No.460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea and <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No.455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1939, Vickers Wellington bombers {{carried out}} a raid on German {{shipping}} in {{what became known as}} the Air Battle of the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Detected on radar and engaged en route to their targets, over half the attacking force was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Ludlow-Hewitt presented a report on the attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners. He again pressed for a new bombsight that featured stabilization to allow the aircraft to manoeuvre while it approached the target.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1939, 24 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers from Marham and Mildenhall bases {{attacked}} <b>Heligoland.</b> These were {{intercepted by}} I./ZG 26 {{along with other}} Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. Specht scored his third victory, shooting down a bomber over the North Sea. But he was also seriously injured by return fire from the Wellington's tail gunner, seriously wounding him in the face. Ditching into the sea, he {{was picked up by}} rescue craft. Losing the sight in his left eye, he spent the next six months in recovery. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December 1939, The Times of London {{published}} {{the story of the}} Battle of the River Plate and the demise of , and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship. In accordance with Operational Order B. 60, dated 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea. The RAF bombers were ordered to overfly the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight and the port of Wilhelmshaven, attacking ships but avoiding civilian living quarters, merchant shipping or land itself.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, the British Harwich Force, {{supported}} by the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, broke into the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight and attacked the II Scouting Group patrols. In the confused action, Mainz and Cöln were sunk, by light cruisers and battlecruisers, respectively. The majority of crewmen from Mainz were {{picked up by the}} British ships, but Cöln was lost with only one survivor. Kolberg was stationed in port during the attack, and steamed out to support the beleaguered German forces, but the British had departed by the time she reached the scene.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{served in}} the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight {{a month after the}} war began and then was sent to the Caribbean to prevent the German East Asia Squadron from using the Panama Canal. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the Battle of the Falkland Islands by the two Invincible-class battlecruisers, Princess Royal rejoined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, {{although}} one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock. She was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required {{a month and a half}} of repairs. Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although they did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in 1917. In 1920 they were both put into reserve and were sold for scrap a few years later under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal was {{moderately}} damaged {{during the}} Battle of Jutland and required {{a month and}} a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the Second Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the North Sea. Princess Royal was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for breaking up as scrap in 1922 to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, a brief engagement between German light cruisers and a raiding force of British cruisers and battlecruisers took place on 28 August 1914. During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. Six German light cruisers—, , , , , and —responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. The arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} of their careers. They saw action at the major engagements, including <b>Heligoland</b> Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served for only a few years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was {{tasked with}} patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea {{in support of}} a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} was {{tasked with}} patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea {{in support of}} a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France. During the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight on 28 August, the ship was part of Cruiser Force 'C', in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action. Hogue did, however, tow the heavily damaged light cruiser , flagship of the commander of the Harwich Force, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, back to port after the battle was over.|$|E
5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near <b>Heligoland,</b> shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating themselves on their success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at <b>Heligoland</b> Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|After their commissioning, Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. Augsburg was instead used as a training ship for torpedo crews and gunnery. Cöln was assigned as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the II Scouting Group was deployed to a patrol line based on the island of <b>Heligoland.</b> Augsburg meanwhile was mobilized for active service and sent into the Baltic. There, she participated in an operation that saw the first shots of the war fired against the Russians, on 2 August.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of <b>Heligoland</b> Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which broke her up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
