5|$|A combativity {{award was}} also {{attributed}} for the rider who had ridden the most aggressively {{in the eyes}} of the judges at the end of every stage. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a rider who featured in breakaways or a cyclist who attacked often.|$|E

6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> {{been for the}} prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been for health or salubrity, as the breath of the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, {{men and women were}} huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp had been deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving; it was not an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|R

5|$|Reduced {{ticket sales}} were {{a concern for}} Gator Bowl officials, who eyed an expiring {{television}} contract with NBC following the game. If attendance and viewership of the game's broadcast were low, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{a negative effect on}} negotiations for future contracts with NBC or its rival, CBS.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{comprehensive}} {{account of}} the battle. However, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taken place at dawn and lasted until midday. Some accounts suggest that local women participated by shooting arrows at the French.|$|E
5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied. Rowling later said that writing the book was a chore, that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been shorter, and that {{she ran out of}} time and energy as she tried to finish it.|$|E

25|$|The first question, then, {{was whether}} it had had an {{adequate}} opportunity to do so, {{regardless of whether it}} actually had. Soler claimed that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> done so at the Supreme Court since the record was already fixed. Therefore, it argued, neither there nor on remand <b>could</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> done so.|$|R

5|$|After the windmill, {{wind power}} {{applications}} in other devices and even vehicles {{were found in}} China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them along by the wind.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E

5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially harmful to humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> on health.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} basic design after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it {{was nothing more than}} a small respite not capitalized as much as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been.|$|E

5|$|On 24 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{appeared}} before media at 22:00 local {{time to give}} a statement regarding Flight 370, during which {{he announced that he}} had been briefed by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch that it and Inmarsat (the satellite data provider) had concluded that the airliner's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean. As there were no places there where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December 1888, {{his body}} was found {{floating}} in the River Thames, off Thornycroft's torpedo works, Chiswick, by a waterman named Henry Winslade. Stones in Druitt's pockets had kept his body submerged for about a month. He was {{in possession of a}} return train ticket to Hammersmith dated 1 December, a silver watch, a cheque for £50 and £16 in gold (equivalent to £ and £ today). It is not known why he should have carried such a large amount of money, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a final payment from the school.|$|E

5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast blame on Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Pasiphae {{group is}} quite dispersed, with a spread over 1.3Gm, inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43. The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, {{which might be}} the result of {{multiple}} collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.|$|E
