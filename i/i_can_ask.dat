25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask</b> for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, {{and there is a lot}} of people around me that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>ask,</b> Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E
