5|$|During the Quasi-War, the United States {{paid tribute}} to the Barbary States to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not seize or harass American {{merchant}} ships. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied {{with the amount of}} tribute in comparison to that paid to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. Thomas Jefferson responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States.|$|E

5|$|Traffic on {{the river}} in 1823 was 39,516tons, which {{generated}} tolls of £2,194. After {{the construction of the}} canal, traffic steadily declined, until income was insufficient to cover maintenance by the early 1860s. The canal company used a similar accounting practice to manage the Tone debt, inflating it at six per cent each year, to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could demonstrate that the river was unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} in order to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E

5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Native Americans ate {{the flesh}} of {{horseshoe}} crabs, and used the tail spines as spear tips and the shells to bail water out of their canoes.

Horseshoe crab blood contains a clotting agent, limulus amebocyte lysate, which is used to test antibiotics and kidney machines to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are free of dangerous bacteria, and to detect spinal meningitis and some cancers.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are fair and {{comply with the requirements}} of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{objected to}} the {{construction}} of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs. OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> forwarded the information on to FEMA.|$|E

If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the short}} stories were adapted for {{publication}} in comic strip format, which were published daily in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The Living Daylights ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on Octopussy, which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. The strips were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would operate {{with a degree of}} autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
