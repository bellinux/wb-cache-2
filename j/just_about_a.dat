[...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist {{is the stuff of}} Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting right at the top with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else."

500|$|Critical receptions {{towards the}} music video were positive.

[...] Tamar Anitai of MTV described the video as [...] "a bummer", writing [...] " [...] isn't <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> girl with her calendar permanently stuck on the twelfth month of the year. It's not just about feeling like a Lady Antebellum song. It's about getting stuck in a place of romantic regret." [...] In a different perspective, Kyle Anderson of MTV argued that the music video puts Swift in a [...] "pantheon of modern classics" [...] with regards to its [...] "almost haunting visual sense" [...] which makes up for the inadequate narrative. Leah Collins of Dose.ca called the music video as [...] "dreamy and moody". Her points are echoed by Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who deemed the video as [...] "kind of lovely", which corresponds with the melancholic yet regretful mood of the song. Joycelyn Vena of MTV noticed that the video is [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "somber", something that is not synonymous with Swift. Yet, The Oxonian Review considers Swift's [...] "listlessness, the bare trees, and snowy indoors" [...] in the music video attuned to the tenor of the song, achieved by [...] "mixing wide shots, medium close ups, and cut-ins of Ms Swift and her ex, matching their gazes across frames, and blurring focus tastefully." ...|$|E

He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar. Eric Helmkamp, Bob’s assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer—he sang on some stuff. It was <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> musical team."

2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
