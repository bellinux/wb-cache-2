5|$|The Fate/stay night anime {{is based}} on the visual novel Fate/stay night by Type-Moon. The episodes are {{directed}} by Yuji Yamaguchi, animated by Studio Deen and produced by the Fate Project, which included Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, Type-Moon and Frontier Works Inc. The plot of the episodes is primarily based on the Fate storyline in the Fate/stay night visual novel, although certain elements of the other two storylines, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's <b>Feel,</b> <b>are</b> incorporated into the plot.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E

25|$|Commercial pet foods, dry {{foods in}} particular, often contain {{a large amount}} of grains, which proponents of grain-free food <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> {{inappropriate}} for carnivorous dogs and cats. Because cats are obligate carnivores, it is believed that a switch to a predominantly meat based raw diet would be especially beneficial (as compared to a raw diet for dogs) due to cats' relative inability to digest grains. Studies comparing the source of protein in dry cat food concluded that the digestibility of meat-based protein is superior to corn-based protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{campus was}} {{designed}} by eleven architects headed by project architect Jimmy Lam (Class of '83).

Its final look and <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> reminiscent of the old Anson Road campus. The building includes the Arena, where the daily flag raising ceremonies, parades and special functions are held, the Heritage Gallery, the school's tallest structure, and The Alumni Room, a gathering place for students.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of {{defining}} qualia is as [...] "raw feels". A raw <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> a perception {{in and of}} itself, considered entirely in isolation from any effect it might have on behavior and behavioral disposition. In contrast, a cooked <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> that perception seen as existing {{in terms of its}} effects. For example, the perception of the taste of wine is an ineffable, raw feel, while the experience of warmth or bitterness caused by that taste of wine would <b>be</b> a cooked <b>feel.</b> [...] Cooked <b>feels</b> <b>are</b> not qualia.|$|R

25|$|High {{voter turnout}} is often {{considered}} to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in public choice, the issue is still debated. A high turnout is generally seen {{as evidence of the}} legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam Hussein's 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation. Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the state of Italy. In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in European Union elections opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.|$|E
500|$|In view of {{the return}} of the Oscars to Hollywood, the Academy hired film {{producer}} and Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Laura Ziskin in September 2001 to oversee production of the telecast. AMPAS president Frank Pierson explained the decision to hire Ziskin saying, [...] "This show {{is one of the most}} difficult—if not the most difficult—producing jobs in show business. Laura Ziskin brings intelligence, experience and wit expressed in everything she has done." [...] This marked the first occurrence that a woman produced the Oscars solo. Four months later, Whoopi Goldberg was selected as host of the 2002 ceremony. In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Ziskin justified her choice of Goldberg commenting that she has [...] "great warmth, with humor, humanity and social conscience, all qualities that I <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> essential for this year's show. I look forward to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and entertaining evening." ...|$|E
500|$|Any [...] "full-length" [...] {{science fiction}} novel written or {{translated}} into English {{is eligible for}} the prize, provided that it {{was first published in}} the United Kingdom during the prior calendar year. There is no restriction on the nationality of the author, and the publication history of works outside of the United Kingdom is not taken into consideration. Books may be submitted for consideration by their publishing company, and beginning in 2016 self-published titles have been eligible with certain qualifications. An official call for entries is issued to UK publishers every year and members of the judging panel and organisation committee also actively call in titles {{they would like to see}} submitted. A title must be actively submitted in order to be considered. The judges form a shortlist of six works that they <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> worthy of consideration, from which they select a winning book. The winner receives an engraved bookend and a prize consisting of a number of pounds sterling equal to the current year, such as £2012 for the year 2012. Prior to 2001, the award was £1000.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, [...] "More {{than in most}} {{animated}} films, the art design and color palette of Wreck-It Ralph permit unlimited sets, costumes, and rules, giving the movie tireless originality and different behavior in every different cyber world." [...] A.O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The movie invites a measure of cynicism– which it proceeds to obliterate with a 93-minute blast of color, noise, ingenuity and fun." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety stated, [...] "With plenty to appeal to boys and girls, old and young, Walt Disney Animation Studios has a high-scoring hit on its hands in this brilliantly conceived, gorgeously executed toon, earning bonus points for backing nostalgia with genuine emotion." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "The movie's subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> a total kick," [...] while Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "With a mix of retro eye-candy for grown-ups and a thrilling, approachable storyline for the tykes, the film casts a wide and beguiling net."

500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since much of our past is so bitter, ... pretend away our most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E

A way to test game <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> to see if interacting with a game's most basic mechanics feels satisfying. At minimum, the game should feel engaging to play even after the plot, points, level design, music, and graphics are removed; if it is not, then the game may suffer from poor game feel.|$|R

But there are things that we <b>feel</b> <b>are</b> entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
