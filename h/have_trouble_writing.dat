500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>writing</b> for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had something approaching real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E

Of course, there are those who say she got what she deserved because she left Neil to die to save herself and I can't say I'm upset that Maddie is gone.

You should present evidence, cite literature, explain economic trade-offs, and generally approach the issue from an analytic perspective. Sometimes, a student is tempted to stray into opinion-page, journalistic writing in his or her term paper. Do not do this.

Once we know the students interests we can integrate it into the lesson plans. Lynda Rice uses the example that if a student <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>writing</b> complete sentences use his interests to help him become motivated. A {{way to do that is}} by incorporating the students favorite things, which in this case was a superhero.

40|$|This action {{research}} project explores {{ways in which}} portfolios {{can be used in}} an English classroom. Students created portfolios by choosing which works were included in the final product. Students improved their organization, showed greater use of voice and style, gained confidence as writers, and acquired some important editing and evaluation tools. The survey shows that most of the students feel that portfolios are worth the time and effort, they allow the teacher to see what the students have accomplished as writers and artists, and that portfolios are an accurate form of alternative assessment. Problem Context and Rationale I have observed the following problems in my tenth grade English classes, both advanced and regular: Students <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>writing</b> effectively for discussion questions, opinion pieces, business letters, explanations of processes, and literary analysis. They have trouble maintaining a structure that provides the relevant information in an orderly fashion while still allowing for individual differences that {{contribute to the development of}} the voice of the writer. Students rely too heavily on the remarks and grades of teachers rather than learning to recognize and evaluate quality work of their own or that of other students. According to Grant Wiggins (1990), “Assessment is authentic when we directly examine student performances on worthy intellectual tasks. ” I plan to use portfolios and their assessment by both the teacher and student to address all of these problems. Research in the areas of authentic assessment, constructivism, and portfolios will be important parts of my project. According to Peggy Bishop (1996), portfolios are one of the best ways for students to analyze their strengths and weaknesses as writers, to construct learning as they need it to create the portfolio, and to demonstrate their abilities in a variety of ways...|$|E

Pérez felt that DC was {{not doing enough to}} celebrate Wonder Woman's 50-year anniversary. To make matters worse in his eyes, DC did not place War of the Gods in newsstand distribution, which meant that the comic book could only be found in comics specialty shops. Pérez had built up a plot to marry the characters Steve Trevor and Etta Candy in his final issue. When he discovered that DC editors had decided to not only pass the Wonder Woman title's writing to William Messner-Loebs and have Messner-Loebs write the final wedding scene, Pérez quit the title and separated himself from DC for several years. In 1992, he was guest inker on Deathstroke the Terminator issues #10-11.|$|R

Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code.

Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave {{the impression that the}} album would be completed as rapidly as in six months, but [...] " [...] took a slow spiral downhill". Recording for the album was halted during the summer when Manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003. On September 10, a backhoe careened into the outer walls of Smart Studios, causing extensive damage. Both Garbage and the band Paris, Texas had been working on their albums. The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, [...] "there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn't agree on songs". Manson suffered writer's block and <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>writing</b> lyrics, and Vig did not like the way the songs sounded. The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit. Duke Erikson said that nobody could agree about the music's direction, and the band {{was on the verge of}} breaking up.
