6000|$|... "I {{often think}} of that jolly walk we had last summer," [...] said Mr. Magnet, [...] "and <b>how</b> you talked <b>about</b> <b>your</b> work at Oxbridge." ...|$|R
6000|$|It took Mr. Bender {{a minute}} {{to do justice to}} these stately remarks. [...] "You rather wonder if I've talked of <b>how</b> I feel <b>about</b> <b>your</b> detaining in your hands my Beautiful Duchess----?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very proper--a very {{proper way}} of putting it. Practical, if I may be allowed to say so. And now, my dear Sir, the next point is: <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> own honoured family--eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] I said hastily, {{for this}} kind of {{confession}} bursting out of the man's lonely heart when what he had drunk took a hold of him, was painful to hear. [...] "But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> daughter, Miss Inez?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{sorry to have}} you go, Master Porter," [...] said the {{principal}} of the academy. [...] "But I can understand <b>how</b> you feel <b>about</b> <b>your</b> father and sister, and it will perhaps be better for you to go in search of them than to sit down here and be on pins and needles over it;" [...] and Doctor Clay smiled kindly.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of {{describing}} {{in detail the}} specifications of a product (as a request for quotation does), a RFA focuses on mutual benefits that both parties would obtain from their alliance: [...] "...engages the potential sponsor in thinking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>your</b> project could help {{his or her own}} larger goals." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> honor's and the colonel's dinner?" [...] Tim asked. [...] "I haven't drawn rations; but I {{have got}} plenty of bread and meat, in the haversack. I got them at Tours, for I thought there wouldn't be much to be had here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a funny}} kind {{of privacy}} you have here," [...] said Jone. [...] "And <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> big clubs? Would {{you like to have}} them all divided up into little {{compartments}} with half a dozen men in each one, generally strangers to each other?" ...|$|E
50|$|For {{websites}} {{that seek}} to generate offline responses, for example people talking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> sophisticated <b>your</b> website is or how large your website logo is, measuring sophistication rates can be difficult {{because it is not}} automatically traced to its source, as you cannot monitor peoples speech. Possible solutions include asking each person or shopper <b>how</b> they heard <b>about</b> the business.|$|R

3000|$|... 1. Define your goals. What message do {{you want}} to deliver? Who will be your audience? Do {{you want to talk to}} the public <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{important}} <b>your</b> work is or focus on keeping <b>your</b> peers informed <b>about</b> <b>your</b> research? Do you want to be a general source of information <b>about</b> <b>your</b> particular field or to provide insights to the general public about broader scientific issues? Answers to these questions are certainly not binding and you can evolve your message through time, but at the beginning of your time as a social media user, it is important to set specific goals and to work towards them.|$|R
6000|$|Capell smiled. [...] "It is no reproach, Greystoke," [...] he said; [...] "and, by Jove, {{it would}} be a mark of {{distinction}} if a fellow could act the part. And now <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> plan? Do you still think you can empty the trench opposite our sector?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{business}} here?" [...] said Mr. Crawley. The farmer {{scratched his}} head, remembering all Mrs. Crawley's injunctions, and awkwardly acknowledged {{that to be}} sure his own business with the miller was very pressing. Then Mr. Crawley descended, terribly suspicious, and went on his journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brother?" [...] {{the captain}} said; [...] "as {{he is to}} be a {{supernumerary}}, I suppose that only means that the firm are willing that he shall put in his time for his rating. I have never had a supernumerary on board, but I suppose he is to be regarded as a passenger rather than one of the ship's complement." ...|$|E

40|$|Remember {{that horrible}} feeling {{you got in}} the pit of your stomach when you first saw that Facebook friend request from <b>your</b> mom? <b>How</b> <b>about</b> when <b>your</b> dad, who had {{previously}} criticized you for your incessant, “senseless” text messaging, started texting you about his bowel movements? All of a sudden, two worlds are beginning to merge: your family life and your social life. And as hard as you try to resist the inexplicable force pulling these worlds together, in the end you’ll probably be fruitless. Mom’s request might remain untouched in the corner of your Facebook page for a while, but eventually somehow she’ll guilt you into accepting (she did, after all, bring you into this world) ...|$|R
40|$|Family life {{programs}} commonly {{collect data}} about who uses their services and participant satisfaction. In my opinion, program designers have been discouraged {{in recent years}} from collecting this information, however, {{because they have been}} criticized {{for not being able to}} say anything about whether a program changed knowledge or behavior. Although demonstrating change in behavior is important, knowing whom you are serving and <b>how</b> people feel <b>about</b> <b>your</b> program is also important.

The very first words I spoke were, [...] "Corky, <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> uncle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The lawyer said: [...] "That {{seems to}} dispose of the {{question}} of the working-man in society. But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> minds? When do you cultivate your minds? When do the ladies of Altruria cultivate their minds, if they have to do their own work, as I suppose they do? Or is it only the men who work, if they happen to be the husbands and fathers of the upper classes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are honest, Shabaka, and I believe you. But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> sons, if {{you have}} any, and how about Amada herself? Well, in great {{businesses}} something must be risked, and I need the gold and the rest which I cannot take for nothing, for you won them by your skill and courage and they are yours. But how you won the seal you have not told us, nor is there {{time for you to}} do so now." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Shang Rong's unfortunate death {{within the}} throne hall before the king, Zhao Qi would also speak his {{ultimate}} beliefs.

[...] Thus, Zhao Qi died with his fellow friend, Shang Rong as a bold figure that would forever serve as a loyal sword of Cheng Tang.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] exclaimed the senator, with a {{touch of}} eagerness he did not often betray, [...] "did you see Grant? <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> old soldier? He's one of the most {{delightful}} characters I ever met--simple as a child," [...] and he laughed at the recollection. [...] "That was a masterstroke of yours, Bass, putting him under that tree with that pretty girl. I doubt if you ever did anything better in your life. Did they tell you about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They aren't {{arranged}} better now. Grip that! Now, it's {{a sort of}} paradox. If you've got big {{gifts and}} you choose to help forward the world, {{if you choose to}} tell all you know and give away everything you can do in the way of work, you've got to give up the ideas of wealth and security, and that means fine women and children. You've got to be a deprived sort of man. 'All right,' you say, 'That's me!' But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> wife being a deprived sort of woman? Eh? That's where it gets you! And meanwhile, you know, while you make your sacrifices and do your researches, there'll be little mean sharp active beasts making money all over you like maggots on a cheese. And if everybody who'd got gifts and altruistic ideas gave themselves up to it, then evidently only the mean and greedy lot would breed and have the glory. They'd get everything. Every blessed thing. There wouldn't be an option they didn't hold. And the other chaps would produce the art and the science and the literature, as far as the men who'd got hold of things would let 'em, and perish out of the earth altogether.... There you are! Still, that's how things are made...." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anxiety the Fourth: The Leather Business; or, The Shutters at Last: a Tale of the City. On this head Morris had no news. He {{had not yet}} {{dared to}} visit the family concern; yet he knew he must delay no longer, and if {{anything}} had been wanted to sharpen this conviction, Michael's references {{of the night before}} rang ambiguously in his ear. Well and good. To visit the city might be indispensable; but what was he to do when he was there? He had no right to sign in his own name; and, with all the will in the world, he seemed to lack the art of signing with his uncle's. Under these circumstances, Morris could do nothing to procrastinate the crash; and, when it came, when prying eyes began to be applied to every joint of his behaviour, two questions could not fail to be addressed, sooner or later, to a speechless and perspiring insolvent. Where is Mr. Joseph Finsbury? and <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> visit to the bank? Questions, how easy to put!--ye gods, how impossible to answer! The man to whom they should be addressed went certainly to gaol, and--eh! what was this?--possibly to the gallows. Morris was trying to shave when this idea struck him, and he laid the razor down. Here (in Michael's words) was the total disappearance of a valuable uncle; here was a time of inexplicable conduct {{on the part of a}} nephew who had been in bad blood with the old man any time these seven years; what a chance for a judicial blunder! [...] "But no," [...] thought Morris, [...] "they cannot, they dare not, make it murder. Not that. But honestly, and speaking as a man to a man, I don't see any other crime in the calendar (except arson) that I don't seem somehow to have committed. And yet I'm a perfectly respectable man, and wished nothing but my due. Law is a pretty business." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{major benefit}} of social media {{is that you}} can see the good and bad things people say <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brand or any {{communication}} that may trigger terrorism. The bigger your company gets, however, the harder it becomes to keep a handle on <b>how</b> everyone feels <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brand.

That’s where contents analysis using data mining software comes in. It monitors and evaluates your online mentions to show you how the whole Web is reacting to your news in real time.
