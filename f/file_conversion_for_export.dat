40|$|Flexible {{digital library}} systems {{need to be}} able to accept, or "import," {{documents}} and metadata in a variety of forms, and associate metadata with the appropriate documents. This paper analyzes the requirements of the import process for general digital libraries. The requirements include (a) format <b>conversion</b> <b>for</b> source documents, (b) the ability to incorporate existing conversion utilities, (c) provision for metadata to be specified in the document files themselves and/or in separate metadata <b>files,</b> (d) format <b>conversion</b> <b>for</b> metadata <b>files,</b> (e) provision for metadata to be computed from the document content, and (f) flexible ways of associating metadata with documents or sets of documents.

An example implementation of this architecture is briefly described...|$|R

The purpose of the Factor <b>File</b> <b>Conversion</b> computer program is to convert factor records from their maintenance format into the format required for computation. The inputs to the routine are a file of factor records in maintenance format (PARMMF tape), and either one or two j*j concordance files (PARMJJ tapes). The output from the routine is a file of factor records in computational format (PARMCF) for use by the PARM central routine.

40|$|This paper aims {{to offer}} {{insights}} into the usability, acceptance and limitations of e-readers {{with regard to the}} specific requirements of scholarly text work. To fit into the academic workflow non-linear reading, bookmarking, commenting, extracting text or the integration of non-textual elements must be supported. A group of social science students were questioned about their experiences with electronic publications for study purposes. This same group executed several text-related tasks with the digitized material presented to them in two different file formats on four different e-readers. Their performances were subsequently evaluated by means of frequency analyses in detail. Findings - e-Publications have made advances in the academic world; however e-readers do not yet fit seamlessly into the established chain of scholarly text-processing focusing on how readers use material during and after reading. Our tests revealed major deficiencies in these techniques. With a small number of participants (n= 26) qualitative insights can be obtained, not representative results. Further testing with participants from various disciplines and of varying academic status is required to arrive at more broadly applicable results. Practical implications - Our test results help to optimize <b>file</b> <b>conversion</b> routines <b>for</b> scholarly texts. We evaluated our data on the basis of descriptive statistics and abstained from any statistical significance test. The usability test of e-readers in a scientific context aligns with both studies on the prevalence of e-books in the sciences and technical test reports of portable reading devices. Still, it takes a distinctive angle in focusing on the characteristics and procedures of textual work in the social sciences and measures the usability of e-readers and file-features against these standards.

We have prototyped a set of e-services that serve {{as a framework for}} understanding content preservation, automation and computational requirements on preservation of electronic records. The framework consists of e-services for (a) finding <b>file</b> format <b>conversion</b> software, (b) executing <b>file</b> format <b>conversions</b> using available software, and (c) evaluating information loss across conversions. While the target audience for the technology is the US National Archives, these basic e-services are of interest to any manager of electronic records and to all citizens trying to keep their files current with the rapidly changing information technology. The novelty of the framework is in organizing the information about <b>file</b> format <b>conversions,</b> providing services about <b>file</b> format <b>conversion</b> paths, in prototyping a general architecture for reusing existing third-party software with import/export capabilities, and in evaluating information loss due to <b>file</b> format <b>conversions.</b> The impact of these e-services is in the widely accessible conversion software registry (CSR), conversion engine (Polyglot) and comparison engine (Versus) which can increase the productivity of the digital preservation community and other users of digital files...|$|R
