500|$|Before {{the show}} started airing, Q posed for several {{billboard}} posters. However, they {{were met with}} some controversy for being revealing, and several locations across the United States, including in areas of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, refused {{to allow them to}} be put up, as they were located near churches and schools. Rick Haskins, the marketing executive for the CW, stated [...] "we've been <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> a few times with some of our campaigns." ...|$|E
500|$|She and I {{sat down}} and wrote this song about some serious insecurities that we had {{when we first started}} <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> with each other, and we both had trust issues. We were getting over it, but we wrote this song about it. And it's perfect. I couldn't be happier about that song and the way it came about and the honest way ... It is like people getting a look at {{something}} personal for the first time.|$|E
500|$|The resignations led to {{questions}} about the compatibility of a strong liberal arts education along with its conservative biblical beliefs. David C. Noe, assistant professor of Classics departed after finding that classical works by non-Christian authors were sometimes considered suspect at PHC, {{and there was an}} increasingly narrow view of Christianity. Root criticized the autocratic lack of faculty participation in the ideas and governing of the school, saying [...] "if [...] continues <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road,</b> will end up being more an 'illiberal arts education'." ...|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the cave}} there is narrow path {{which is called}} “the women road” because {{a long time ago}} a foreign princess fell <b>down</b> on <b>this</b> <b>road.</b> After she {{returned}} from the cave she got married.

500|$|Historian Michael Burleigh {{compared}} the assassinations to the Allied bombing of Nazi V2 rocket sites during World War II, {{noting that the}} bombers [...] "were not unduly concerned whether scientists and engineers were killed too, nor foreign slave labourers, provided the V2s ceased raining down on London." [...] According to Burleigh, scientists are not abstract researchers; there are [...] "real world" [...] consequences of their actions, and he [...] "shall not shed any tears whenever one of these [...] scientists encounters one of the unforgiving men on motorbikes ... Except that if Israel ventures <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road,</b> I cannot think of much of an argument to prevent Iran following them, and then anyone else who decides to follow." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Magruder's {{units were}} behind Stonewall Jackson's column while marching down the Long Bridge Road, {{which led to}} Malvern Hill. Along this road were several {{adjoining}} pathways. One such road, called the Willis Church Road by some locals and the Quaker Road by others, led south from Glendale to Malvern Hill. Lee's maps labeled this [...] "Quaker Road". Another of these paths began near a local farm and angled southwest toward an upriver point on the River Road—some locals called this the Quaker Road, including Magruder's guides, who led Magruder's army <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> rather than the Quaker Road shown on Lee's maps. James Longstreet eventually rode after Magruder, and persuaded him to reverse course. This incident delayed Magruder's arrival to the battlefield for three hours.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she and I sat down and wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had when we first started <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect". The concept for [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was developed by both singers, and began with Shelton writing the first verse, followed by Stefani creating the second, which Shelton described: ...|$|E

50|$|The town {{is about}} 1 km {{south of the}} {{intersection}} of the Burnett Highway and the Mundubbera-Durong road. The Burnett Highway links Mundubbera with Gaydah and Goomeri to the east; and Eidsvold, Monto and Biloela to the north. The Mundubbera-Durong links Mundubbera to Dalby and Toowoomba in the Darling <b>Downs.</b> <b>This</b> <b>road</b> is single lane bitumen in places.Public transport is limited. In 2005 the only public transport servicing Mundubbera had was a bus service operating once a week on Thursdays to Bundaberg and on Wednesdays and Fridays to Maryborough. An active rail link from Mundubbera to Maryborough and the coast was maintained with the line no longer having a passenger service, however in 2012 Campbell Newman, the Queensland Premier, announced that the line would no longer be looked after.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 361, Julian led his army into the {{territory}} of the Alamanni, where he captured their king, Vadomarius. Julian claimed that Vadomarius had been in league with Constantius, encouraging him to raid the borders of Raetia. Julian then divided his forces, sending one column to Raetia, one to northern Italy and the third he led down the Danube on boats. His forces claimed control of Illyricum and his general, Nevitta, secured the pass of Succi into Thrace. He was now well out of his comfort zone and on the road to civil war. (Julian would state in late November that he set off <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> [...] "because, having been declared a public enemy, I meant to frighten him [...] merely, and that our quarrel should result in intercourse on more friendly terms...") ...|$|E

50|$|The British General Lord Cornwallis {{traveled}} {{along the}} road with his troops on August 26, 1776, to the Battle of Brooklyn. He achieved a major defeat for the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. When President George Washington came to survey the agricultural abilities of Kings, Queens, and Suffolk counties after the war in 1792, he traveled <b>down</b> <b>this</b> rural <b>road.</b> Gradually, farmers moved into the area and developed their homesteads {{along the road}}.|$|R

[...] A March 2014 blog post says: [...] "Like the most warped fundamentalists who exploit tragedy, the merchants of eco-doom also cynically seize on current events.

50|$|After the shootings, Bieber escaped down Dib Lane, {{and stole}} a car at gunpoint outside a betting shop further <b>down</b> the <b>road.</b> <b>This</b> caused some {{confusion}} in initial news reports of the shootings, which state that the shooting itself happened outside the betting shop.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011, Rivard {{voted in}} favor of Governor Walker's budget fix bill that ended most of the {{bargaining}} rights of public unions in Wisconsin. For his vote, he reportedly was threatened with boycotts of his real estate business, which he called [...] "government by intimidation". Rivard later voted for Walker's 2011-2013 budget, which reduced funds to public schools, the state university system, technical colleges and local governments. Regarding his votes in support of the budget bills, Rivard said, [...] "I {{knew it was going to}} be rough, because - apparently - we went <b>down</b> <b>this</b> (spending) <b>road</b> for many, many years and they didn't have the courage to do it".|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} road is on {{the east}} side of the line and drops down to the road that passes beneath the line at the south end of the platform.

60|$|Finding {{it rather}} {{difficult}} {{to pursue the}} conversation <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road,</b> Mr and Mrs Boffin sat staring at mid-air, and Mrs Wilfer sat silently giving them to understand that every breath she drew required to be drawn with a self-denial rarely paralleled in history, until Miss Bella appeared: whom Mrs Wilfer presented, and to whom she explained {{the purpose of the}} visitors.|$|E
60|$|I wonder did Petrarch walk often <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road</b> {{from his}} house just above?

I was driving <b>down</b> <b>this</b> Telegraph <b>Road...</b> and it just {{went on and on}} and on forever, it's like what they call linear development. And I just started to think, I wondered how that road must have been when it started, what it must have first been. And then really that's how it all came about yeah, I just put that book together and the place where I was, I was actually sitting in the front of the tour bus at the time." ...|$|R

60|$|A mile <b>down</b> <b>this</b> <b>road,</b> {{growing more}} and more obscure with those rising and falling apparitions or the shapeless and rugged heaps terrible in their {{helpless}} inertia by hedge and fence, arose the cemetery hill. Taken and retaken thrice that afternoon, the dead above it far outnumbered the dead below; and when at last the tide of battle swept around its base into the dull, reverberating woods, and it emerged from the smoke, silenced and abandoned, only a few stragglers remained. One of them, leaning on his musket, was still gloomily facing the woods.|$|E

For answer he seemed to throw himself off the box, so quickly did he reach the ground. Then he {{stretched}} out his hands appealingly to me, and implored me not to go. There was just enough of English mixed with the German for me to understand the drift of his talk. He seemed always just about to tell me something--the very idea of which evidently frightened him; but each time he pulled himself up, saying, as he crossed himself: 'Walpurgis-Nacht!' ...|$|E

6000|$|Sancho {{seemed to}} share the longing, for he kept running off a little way and {{stopping}} to frisk and bark; then rushed back to sit watching his master with those intelligent eyes of his, which seemed to say, [...] "Come on, Ben, let us scamper <b>down</b> <b>this</b> pleasant <b>road</b> and never stop till we are tired." [...] Swallows darted by, white clouds fled before the balmy west wind, a squirrel ran along the wall, and all things seemed to echo the boy's desire to leave toil behind and roam away as care-free as they. One thing restrained him, {{the thought of his}} seeming ingratitude to good Mrs. Moss, and the disappointment of the little girls at the loss of their two new play-fellows. While he paused to think of this, something happened which kept him from doing what he would have been sure to regret afterward.|$|R
