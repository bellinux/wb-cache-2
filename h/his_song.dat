5|$|In 1972, Ochs {{was asked}} to write the theme song for the film Kansas City Bomber. The task proved difficult, as Ochs {{struggled}} to overcome his writer's block. Although <b>his</b> <b>song</b> was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a single.|$|E
5|$|Jason had a song {{dedicated}} {{to him and}} his accomplishments on the court by an artist named Iron Butter. Jason also did several interviews and appeared at the Summerjam concert where <b>his</b> <b>song</b> was performed.|$|E

50|$|Mike's vocal weren't great so he {{performed}} <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> in recitative style. He obtained popularity mostly because {{the lyrics of}} <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were full of irony and satire. The majority of <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were a first-person narrative, though, as Mike claimed in the interviews, it didn't mean that this person was himself.|$|R
5000|$|He often {{writes the}} lyrics and music to <b>his</b> <b>songs,</b> himself. Most of <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were choreographed by himself since [...] "Inside Your Head" [...] was released.|$|R
5|$|The {{figure of}} Orpheus is {{prominent}} throughout the narrative, and Clement contrasts <b>his</b> <b>song,</b> representing pagan superstition, {{with the divine}} Logos of Christ. According to Clement, through conversion to Christianity alone can man fully participate in the Logos, which is universal truth.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1906, Mahler had been {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years. Throughout this time his practice was to leave Vienna {{at the close of}} the Hofoper season for a summer retreat, where he could devote himself to composition. Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and <b>his</b> <b>song</b> cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E
5|$|The male common {{chiffchaff}} {{is highly}} territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20metres (66ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. <b>His</b> <b>song,</b> given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.|$|E
50|$|Galbraith has {{garnered}} fame {{outside the}} British Isles, especially in China, where <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> were chosen {{as part of}} the Chinese education curriculum for learning English. <b>His</b> <b>songs</b> are used to help Chinese children learn English as <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> are easy to remember and suitable for children. In May 2008, Galbraith undertook a successful two cities tour in China, of Beijing and Shenzhen.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>songs</b> 105 and Hold on To Me were {{featured}} in episodes of The N network's South of Nowhere. Deep, another of <b>his</b> <b>songs,</b> {{was used in}} a commercial advertising the show.|$|R
50|$|Rosenbaum {{sometimes}} employs peculiar musical time signatures {{and patterns}} in <b>his</b> <b>songs,</b> striving to sound fresh and unique - a bit atypical for a songwriter that employs gangster and criminal slang elements in his lyrics. Though many of <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> are elaborate in their instrumentation, the stress {{is placed on}} the primary melodies of <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> and their messages, as is usually the case in bard music.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating <b>his</b> <b>song.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for <b>his</b> <b>song</b> choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary <b>his</b> <b>song</b> production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E

50|$|<b>His</b> <b>songs</b> didn't just foresee {{societal}} changes, {{but also}} presented their listeners with comfort in times that required great sacrifice. <b>His</b> <b>songs</b> tended {{to follow the}} taste of the times, as well as current events.|$|R
5000|$|<b>His</b> <b>songs</b> were {{primarily}} composed in Igbo language {{with a bit}} of Efik. In a 1986 edition of Thisweek, a writer once wrote that <b>his</b> <b>songs</b> [...] "gave a food for thought to its listeners".|$|R
5|$|The album {{features}} ten tunes; six songs, two alternate versions {{and another}} two theme songs. The album featured vocals from singers Karthik, Vijay Yesudas, Bombay Jayashri, Nithyasree Mahadevan and P. B. Sreenivas, {{who made a}} comeback to playback singing with <b>his</b> <b>song.</b> Moreover, Dhanush and Aishwarya sung for the album along with the composer, Prakash Kumar and Andrea Jeremiah. Lyrics for the songs were written by Vairamuthu, Veturi Sundararama Murthy, Selvaraghavan and Andrea Jeremiah. For a song set in the thirteenth century, research was carried out to find instruments used during that period. A Yaazh, a melodic instrument used in the Sangam Period, and a horn, a brass instrument made from animal horns from Bhutan, were used. The soundtrack garnered critical acclaim and was considered Prakash Kumar's finest work to date. Furthermore, shortly after the music release, an album success meet was held.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in <b>his</b> <b>song.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walton {{was never}} a facile or quick composer, and in his final decade, he found {{composition}} increasingly difficult. He repeatedly tried to compose a third symphony for André Previn, but eventually abandoned it. Many of his final works are re-orchestrations or revisions of earlier music. He orchestrated <b>his</b> <b>song</b> cycle Anon. in Love (originally for tenor and guitar), and {{at the request of}} Neville Marriner adapted his A minor String Quartet as a Sonata for Strings. One original work from this period was his Jubilate Deo, premiered as one of several events to celebrate his seventieth birthday. The British prime minister, Edward Heath, gave a birthday dinner for Walton at 10 Downing Street, attended by royalty and Walton's most eminent colleagues; Britten presented a Walton evening at Aldeburgh and Previn conducted an all-Walton concert at the Royal Festival Hall.|$|E
50|$|Rahul Raj {{is known}} for giving ultra-modern {{orchestration}} in <b>his</b> <b>songs.</b> He uses international elements for the instrumentation in <b>his</b> <b>songs.</b> <b>His</b> background scores in particular are rich with elements of symphony and Western Classical music.|$|R

5|$|Walton's orchestral {{works of}} the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). <b>His</b> <b>song</b> cycles from this period were {{composed}} for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin. A concert suite of Walton's score was published and recorded after Walton's death. After his experience over Battle of Britain, Walton declared that he would write no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of Chekhov's Three Sisters in 1969.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. <b>His</b> <b>song</b> Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
