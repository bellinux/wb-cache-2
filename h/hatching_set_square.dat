50|$|The most simple form of <b>set</b> <b>square</b> is a {{triangular}} piece of transparent plastic (or formerly of polished wood) with the centre removed. More commonly the <b>set</b> <b>square</b> bears the markings of a ruler {{and a half}} circle protractor. The outer edges are typically bevelled. These <b>set</b> <b>squares</b> come in two usual forms, both right triangles: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles. Combining the two forms by placing the hypotenuses together will also yield 15° and 75° angles. They are often purchased in packs with protractors and compasses.|$|R

40|$|Clustering is {{automated}} {{identification of}} groups of objects based on similarity. In clustering two major research issues are scalability and {{the requirement of}} domain knowledge to determine input parameters. Most approaches suggest the use of sampling {{to address the issue}} of scalability. However, sampling does not guarantee the best solution and can cause significant loss in accuracy. Most approaches also require the use of domain knowledge, trial and error techniques, or exhaustive searching to figure out the required input parameters. In this paper we introduce a new clustering technique based on the <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance. Cluster membership is determined based on the <b>set</b> <b>squared</b> distance to the respective cluster. As in the case of mean for k-means and median for k-medoids, the cluster is represented by the entire cluster of points for each evaluation of membership. The <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance for all n items can be computed efficiently in O(n) using a vertical data structure and a few pre-computed values. Special ordering of the <b>set</b> <b>square</b> distance is used to break the data into the “natural ” clusters compared to the need of a known k for k-means or kmedoids type of partition clustering. Superior results are observed when the new clustering technique is compared with the classical k-means clustering. To prove the cluster quality and the resolution of the unknown k, data sets with known classes such as the iris data, the uci_kdd network intrusion data, and synthetic data are used. The scalability of the proposed technique is proved using a large RSI data set. Keywords Vertical <b>Set</b> <b>Square</b> Distance, P-trees, Clustering. 1...|$|R
