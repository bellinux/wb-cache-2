5|$|For the {{extension}} to Queen's Park, the LER supplemented the <b>existing</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> with 14 new carriages ordered from Brush Traction and Leeds Forge Company plus spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP These carriages, the 1914 stock, {{were the first}} to have doors in the sides of the carriages as well as the ends. For the longer extension to Watford, the LER and the LNWR ordered 72 new carriages from the Metropolitan Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. Manufacture of this rolling stock was delayed by the war, and, while it was waiting for delivery, the Bakerloo Tube used spare 1915 stock carriages ordered for an unfinished extension of the CLR to Ealing Broadway and more spare Gate stock carriages from the GNP Delivery of the carriages for the Watford service, known as the Watford Joint stock because ownership was shared with the LNWR, began in 1920; they were painted in the LNWR's livery to distinguish them from trains operating only on the Bakerloo Tube's tracks.|$|E

25|$|For this upgrade DLR {{purchased}} {{an additional}} 31 cars compatible with <b>existing</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> The works were originally planned as three phases: Bank-Lewisham, Poplar-Stratford, and the Beckton branch. The original £200m contract was awarded on 3 May 2007. Work started in 2007 and Bank-Lewisham was originally {{due to be}} completed in 2009. However, the work programme for the first two phases was merged and the infrastructure work was completed by the end of January 2010. The Lewisham-Bank route now runs three-car trains exclusively.

Stratford to Lewisham and Bank to Woolwich Arsenal services sometimes operate as three-car trains; other routes will run the longer trains when demand requires it.|$|E
25|$|The {{city council}} voted in 1960 to {{gradually}} close down the tramway {{and replace it}} with the metro and diesel buses. Operations could continue with the <b>existing</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> although all investments were halted. In the following eight years the least trafficked tram lines were closed. SM53 was most commonly used on lines 1, 2, 7 and 11 in this period, specifically serving the Briskeby Line, the Frogner Line, the Ullevål Hageby Line, the Sinsen Line, the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line and the Kjelsås Line, as well as the suburban lines. The Chickens were used on the Sagene Line. The last SM53 ran on the Lambertseter Line on 17 May 1966 and on the Østensjø Line 29 October 1967, as these were converted to metro lines. From then all SM53s were stalled at Grefsen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{approach}} for speed tuning in railway management is proposed {{in order to}} optimize journey duration and energy consumption. Indeed, in railway transportation, fastness of travel has often been preferred to other criteria, such as energy. However, for recent years, the concern due to pollution and global warming leads to develop more eco-aware transportation systems, notably for the <b>existing</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Nevertheless, reducing energy consumption is, most of the time, achieved {{at the expense of}} journey durations. In order to obtain compromises between journey duration and energy saving, this approach deals with a bi-criteria optimization problem, which consists in designing speed profiles integrating both criteria in order to provide patterns of speed control. For that reason, the main objective of the proposed method is to obtain a set of solutions, diversified enough to help decision-makers to choose the most suited speed profile. Based on a state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, the approach searches for diversified solutions in a continuous space. So as to evaluate these solutions, the Pareto approach is used to assess and rank them. Validating the method is done by applying it on a reallife case study: the Saint-Etienne–Rive de Giers line in France. The outcomes are then detailed and analyzed in order to highlight the efficiency of the method...|$|R

During the oil shortage, all the <b>existing</b> electric <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was pressed into service, including maintenance trucks and KTH-1 trolleybuses produced by the Kiev electric factory.

30|$|It appears that, {{in certain}} cases, there is {{insufficient}} impetus from governments to facilitate energy efficiency improvements; both through the aforementioned {{lack of funding}} mechanisms, {{and the lack of}} legislation requiring improvements in energy efficiency, particularly in the case of existing assets. Necessitating such energy efficiency improvements is very important for urban rail systems; given the 30 – 60 -year working life of <b>rolling</b> <b>stock,</b> many vehicles currently in use in light rail, tram and metro systems will still be in service for decades [15]. However, current energy efficiency directives fail to place sufficient emphasis on increasing the energy efficiency in the <b>existing</b> infrastructure, <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and equipment. It is widely acknowledged that the greatest energy savings can come from the existing buildings and transport yet, until 2012, the only legislation to instigate such actions was voluntary [16]. More recent legislation has failed to properly address this, which appears to be due to inappropriate implementation, and the weakening of requirements throughout the legislative process. This can be attributed to a lack of both political will and a sufficient understanding of the urban rail systems [16, 17]. However, there are significant costs associated with the retrofitting energy efficiency technologies to the <b>existing</b> <b>rolling</b> stock; where the new technology is not replacing the existing technology {{at the end of its}} life, often the energy/cost savings are insufficient to allow the new technology to deliver benefits during the remaining life of the <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> Additional funding mechanisms may be required, given the scale of the energy savings delivered.|$|R
