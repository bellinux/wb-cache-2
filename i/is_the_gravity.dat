The only equipment <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gravity</b> Gun, used to freeze and unfreeze blocks, pick them up and move them. Each side has access to {{a limited number of}} blocks (default of 50, but can be set to any value), which can be spawned (using buttons in a spawn bay) and then picked up with the gravity gun and used. Blocks come in five different shapes (2x1x1 oblong, 5x1 panel, 3x2 panel, 2x2 panel, and 2x1 panel) which enable the players to create a wide variety of structures, which include crawl tunnels, sky forts, sprint ramps and walls.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Canada’s {{petroleum}} {{effort has}} focused on producing oil from the oil sands (sometimes called “tar sands”) of northern Alberta. To appreciate these resources, {{it is important to}} understand a simple concept from chemistry and physics: the [...] "gravity" [...] of crude oil and natural gas liquids. The oil industry measures the weight of oil on terms of an artificial scale known as API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity. Ten degrees API <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravity</b> of water. Light oils use a higher API number. Generally heavier than water, bitumen typically has an API of 8-10 degrees API.|$|E
2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravity</b> knife). Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E

60|$|The two facts which attract {{almost every}} normal person to {{children}} are, first, {{that they are}} very serious, and, secondly, that they are in consequence very happy. They are jolly with the completeness which is possible only in the absence of humour. The most unfathomable schools and sages have never attained to the gravity which dwells in the eyes of a baby of three months old. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravity</b> of astonishment at the universe, and astonishment at the universe is not mysticism, but a transcendent common-sense. The fascination of children lies in this: that with each of them all things are remade, and the universe is put again upon its trial. As we walk the streets and see below us those delightful bulbous heads, three times too big for the body, which mark these human mushrooms, we ought always primarily to remember that within every one of these heads there is a new universe, as new as it was on the seventh day of creation. In each of those orbs there is a new system of stars, new grass, new cities, a new sea.|$|E
60|$|Besides, however, such {{influences}} as these, {{there is}} little more distinction between the faculties than the traditionary ideal, handed down through a long sequence of students, and getting rounder and more featureless at each successive session. The plague of uniformity has descended on the College. Students (and indeed all sorts and conditions of men) now require their faculty and character hung round their neck on a placard, like the scenes in Shakespeare's theatre. And {{in the midst of}} all this weary sameness, not the least common feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravity</b> of every face. No more does the merry medical run eagerly in the clear winter morning up the rugged sides of Arthur's Seat, and hear the church bells begin and thicken and die away below him among the gathered smoke of the city. He will not break Sunday to so little purpose. He no longer finds pleasure in the mere output of his surplus energy. He husbands his strength, and lays out walks, and reading, and amusement with deep consideration, so that he may get as much work and pleasure out of his body as he can, and waste none of his energy on mere impulse, or such flat enjoyment as an excursion in the country.|$|E
