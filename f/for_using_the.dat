5|$|In 1996 John Sykes {{decided to}} reactivate Thin Lizzy, {{presenting}} the band {{as a tribute}} to Phil Lynott's life and work. He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as bass player. They received criticism <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E
5|$|In Tamil Nadu, {{partisan}} television channels {{associated with}} the ruling AIADMK and the opposing DMK political parties were criticised <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> disaster for their own political purposes. Also, several claimed that the political parties obstructed the flood relief efforts of the volunteers for their own gains. National media outlets were widely criticised on social media for failing to adequately report on the flood crisis. On 2 December, the government Press Information Bureau (PIB) released an edited photo showing the Prime Minister looking down from an aircraft window which was removed after criticism.|$|E
5|$|The Act of 1767 had {{specified}} {{points on}} the river at which tolls could be collected, but had {{made no mention of}} tolls for use of Bow Creek, Bow Back Rivers, or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford, and these had remained toll-free. An Act of Parliament obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates. To prevent opposition from the bargees, the Act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section. Once the lock was built, however, the trustees charged a toll for using it. This was unpopular, but there was still the option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide, which did not incur a toll. A clause to authorise the lock toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent Act of 1868, and it was still the case in 1977 that a charge was made <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> lock but not <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> gates.|$|E

5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems.

5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company.

5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay a fee <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> technique of renormalization.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} a potential SANDAG {{purchase of the}} road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to {{spend millions of dollars}} to maintain and repair parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> road; the San Diego Union-Tribune criticized the decision. in mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.|$|E

Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions.

5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Foreign operas {{were popular}} among the upper-class {{throughout}} the 19th century, while other styles of musical theater included operettas, ballad operas and the opera bouffe. The English operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan were particularly popular, while American compositions had trouble finding an audience. George M. Cohan {{was the first}} notable American composer of musical theater, {{and the first to}} move away from the operetta, and is also notable <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> language of the vernacular in his work. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, black playwrights, composers and musicians were having a profound effect on musical theater, beginning with the works of Will Marion Cook, James Reese Europe and James P.

5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator to prefer 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E

The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason <b>for</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> same type of train as the Airport Express Train, was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process.
