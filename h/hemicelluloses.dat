5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood <b>hemicelluloses</b> creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) <b>hemicelluloses,</b> protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Bound or {{hygroscopic}} water: Bound {{water is}} bound to the wood via hydrogen bonds. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free hydroxyl (OH) groups in the cellulose, <b>hemicelluloses</b> and lignin molecules in the cell wall.

However, high quality <b>hemicellulose</b> extraction is not an easy issue.

The lignin limited the <b>hemicellulose</b> dissolution and increased the color value by binding to <b>hemicellulose</b> molecules and forming lignin-carbohydrate complexes. Sodium chlorite method can remove about 90 % lignin from corn stover, especially the lignin connected to <b>hemicellulose</b> through p-coumaric and ferulic acids.

Moreover, makino bamboo contained less <b>hemicellulose</b> than moso bamboo {{with or without}} epidermis. In conclusion, {{the results indicated that}} EPT and SHT contributed to reduce cellulose contents. These findings were similar to those reported that <b>hemicellulose</b> had low thermal stability and coursed most degradation by heat treatment.

The possible reason for this phenomenon might due to <b>hemicellulose</b> is one kind of plant cell-wall polysaccharides, which linked to lignin by covalent bonds and interconnected together with cellulose by physical intermixing. Previous studies also have demonstrated a relationship between the degradation of <b>hemicellulose</b> components, such as arabinose and mannose, and wood strength losses. The significant reduction in strength observed during incipient decay is, therefore, to be due to <b>hemicellulose</b> decomposition [25].|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the effect of}} torrefaction severity on structure changes of <b>hemicellulose,</b> cellulose, lignin and their subsequent catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) behavior, torrefaction of lignin, <b>hemicellulose,</b> and cellulose was performed in a tubular reactor with different reaction temperatures (210 - 300 degrees C) and residence times (20 - 60 min). The experimental {{results show that the}} rank order of thermal stability during torrefaction was cellulose > lignin > <b>hemicellulose.</b> The torrefied hemicelulose, cellulose, and lignin were subsequently catalytic-fast-pyrolyzed over HZSM- 5 in a semi-batch pyroprobe reactor. The effects of the torrefaction temperature and residence time on aromatic yields and selectivity from CFP of torrefied <b>hemicellulose,</b> cellulose, and lignin were investigated. The experimental results showed that torrefaction can cause the reduction in the aromatic yield and increase in benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) selectivity from CFP of torrefied <b>hemicellulose</b> and lignin. It has little impact on CFP of torrefied cellulose. The results can be explained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and C- 13 cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of torrefied <b>hemicellulose,</b> cellulose, and lignin. The rank order of structure change during torrefaction was <b>hemicellulose</b> > lignin > cellulose.

They are relatively under-utilized hetero-polysaccharides present in lignocellulosic biomass. In this research an alkaline treatment was optimized for extraction of polymeric <b>hemicellulose</b> from fully bleached hardwood pulp (B-HWP) and partially delignified switchgrass (SWG). The <b>hemicellulose</b> extracted from B-HWP was relatively pure with zero percent lignin and 89. 5 % xylose content whereas the partially delignified SWG <b>hemicellulose</b> contained about 6 - 3 % lignin and 72 – 82 % xylose, depending on the NaOH concentration during extraction (3 – 17 % NaOH solution). A maximum molecular weight of SWG <b>hemicellulose</b> of 64, 300 g/mol was achieved for the 10 % NaOH solution extraction, whereas the MW of B-HWP <b>hemicellulose</b> at 10 % NaOH solution extraction was lower at 49, 200 g/mol.

30|$|We {{cultivated}} C. cellulovorans {{in media}} containing {{three kinds of}} polysaccharides (cellulose-xylan, cellulose-pectin, and cellulose-LBG) to investigate the assimilation profile. C. cellulovorans grew better in media containing both cellulose and <b>hemicellulose</b> than that containing only cellulose. The results demonstrated that xylan was first assimilated, whereas cellulose was continuously utilized in cellulose-xylan media. Faster growth of C. cellulovorans {{in the presence of}} various carbon sources could be due to switching of target polysaccharides for assimilation from <b>hemicellulose</b> to cellulose. In the initial stage of growth, C. cellulovorans might consume <b>hemicellulose</b> which is easier to degrade before competitive cellulolytic bacteria can assimilate them. Non-cellulosomal and cellulosomal carbohydrases for <b>hemicellulose</b> and cellulose are secreted as it has grown, and therefore, cellulose can be degraded and assimilated. Thus, the presence of <b>hemicellulose</b> promoted cellulose utilization as well as growth, leading to efficient utilization of carbon sources in the media containing both of cellulose and <b>hemicellulose.</b> This characteristic is valuable for the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, which contains not only cellulose but also <b>hemicellulose.</b>|$|R

30|$|In general, {{cellulose}} microfibrils are {{the main}} contributor to the mechanical properties of wood cell walls because of their highly crystalline structure. The spatial angle between cellulose microfibrils and the longitudinal axis, i.e., the microfibril angle (MFA), of the middle layer of the secondary wall is important in determining the mechanical and physical properties of wood fibers [1, 3 – 6]. <b>Hemicellulose</b> is a non-crystalline polysaccharide distributed inhomogeneously in cell walls. <b>Hemicellulose</b> is bound to cellulose and lignin by hydrogen and covalent bonds, respectively [7, 8]. Consequently, <b>hemicellulose</b> is essential for maintaining cell wall assembly. <b>Hemicellulose</b> controls cellulose microfibril aggregation and {{the distance between them}} [9]. Lignin is an isotropic three-dimensional (3 D) macromolecule that forms bead-like modules in the <b>hemicellulose</b> gel that fills the space between cellulose microfibrils [10].
