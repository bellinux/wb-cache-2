5|$|Daniel Pinkerton is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the Uncharted: <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra motion comic. Fred Tatasciore provides his voice. Pinkerton is an American who has become a crime boss in Indonesia. Pinkerton hires Drake, who is seeking the funds to raise the coffin of Francis Drake, to find the valuable <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra. After discovering that Pinkerton has unknowingly had the Eye in his safe the whole time, Drake attempts to retrieve it by raiding Pinkerton's home. Pinkerton captures Drake, and tortures him when he refuses to reveal the treasure's location. When Drake eventually reveals {{the location of the}} <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra, Rika Raja shoots and kills Pinkerton, and the two take the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra for themselves.|$|E

5|$|In another temple ritual, the pharaoh {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} game {{in honor of}} the Eye goddesses Hathor, Sekhmet, or Tefnut, in which he struck a ball symbolizing the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Apep with a club made from a type of wood that was said to have sprung from the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra. The ritual represents, in a playful form, the battle of Ra's Eye with its greatest foe.|$|E
60|$|Yet was {{the smile}} tender, {{for in the}} child's eyes I saw the woman eternal, the woman of all times and appearances.

5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra is another point of overlap with the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra or <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. The Eye {{is an extension of}} Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The Eye goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the Eye goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra is similar to the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the Eye goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E

5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{elevate the}} {{stability}} of Bigbag intraocular lens(IOL) implanted for high myopia. METHODS: In this prospective control trail, axial length ≥ 28 mm of high myopia with or without cataract patients in our hospiotal from May 2012 to February 2014 were selected. They {{were divided into two}} groups and were implanted with Bigbag IOL or Sensar IOL after phacoemulsification surgery. After 6 mo, complications and the status of IOL posterior capsule were observed, the differences of distance between posterior capsule and retina before and after operation(Δd) were compared. RESULTS:Sixty-three <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 52 cases were included. There were 30 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 24 cases(female: 19 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 15 cases; male: 11 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 9 cases) in the Bigbag group and 33 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 28 cases(female: 19 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 16 cases; male: 14 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 12 cases) in the Sensar group. The Δd was 1. 49 ± 0. 06 mm in the Bigbag group and 1. 67 ± 0. 09 mm in the Sensar group, with statistically significant difference(P P = 0. 031). CONCLUSION:The stability of Bigbag IOL is better than Sensar wiht low incidence of PCS. The Bigbag IOL is more suitable for high myopia...|$|R

5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} rigid gas permeable contact lens(RGPCL) for high myopia with corneal astigmatism. METHODS: Totally 72 patients(118 eyes) with high myopia with corneal astigmatism were fitted with RGPCL, and the corrected visual acuity were recorded after one month. The MPMVA(maximum plus to maximum visual acuity) were recorded by comprehensive refraction. The corrected visual acuity of RGPCL was compared with the MPMVA. RESULTS: There were 17 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 4. 7 (14. 4 %), 52 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 4. 8 (44. 1 %) and 49 <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> 4. 9 - 5. 0 (41. 5 %) in comprehensive refraction.
