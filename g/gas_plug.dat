In this corner stands a flat writing-table, on which are a phonograph, a laryngoscope, a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows, a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> in the wall by an indiarubber tube, several tuning-forks of different sizes, a life-size image of half a human head, showing in section the vocal organs, and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph.|$|E
50|$|The M240D {{is issued}} for {{aircraft}} configuration. The barrel assembly contains a three position <b>gas</b> <b>plug.</b> The first <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> position allows the weapon to cycle at 650-750 {{rounds per minute}} (RPM), the second <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> positions allows the weapon to fire at 750-850 rounds per minute (RPM), and the third <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> position allows the weapon to fire at 850-950 rounds per minute (RPM). The aircraft configured M240D weighs 25.6 lb (11.6 kg) and is 42.3 in (1074.42 mm) long, while the egress configuration weighs 26.2 lb (11.9 kg) and is 49 in (1244.6 mm) long.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGas {{and liquid}} streams are {{invariably}} separated either by a solid wall or by a membrane for heat or mass transfer between {{the gas and}} liquid streams. Without the separating wall, the gas phase is present as bubbles in liquid or, in a microsystem, as <b>gas</b> <b>plugs</b> between slugs of liquid. Continuous and direct contact between the two moving streams of gas and liquid is quite an efficient way of achieving heat or mass transfer between the two phases. Here, we report a silicon nanowire built-in microsystem in which a liquid stream flows in contact with an underlying gas stream. The upper liquid stream does not penetrate into the lower gas stream due to the superamphiphobic nature of the silicon nanowires built into the bottom wall, thereby preserving the integrity of continuous gas and liquid streams, although they are flowing in contact. Due to the superamphiphobic nature of silicon nanowires, the microsystem provides the best possible interfacial mass transfer known to date between flowing gas and liquid phases, which can achieve excellent chemical performance in two-phase organic syntheses...|$|R
5000|$|The CMG-2's barrel was {{detachable}} and had {{a folding}} handle, so an overheated barrel could be replaced in the field. The barrel had a 1:9 twist and was meant to fire an experimental [...] bullet, designed for longer ranges than the then-standard [...] M193 bullet. Unlike the M60 machine gun then in use in the Vietnam War, which had its bipod and gas cylinder as integral to the spare barrel, an M2 bipod was mounted over the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> set in the CMG-2's ventilated handguard and was locked into place by the spare barrel's gas block.|$|E
50|$|The FAL {{operates}} {{by means}} of a gas-operated action very {{similar to that of the}} Russian SVT-40. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the barrel, and the locking mechanism is what is known as a tilting breechblock. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy receiver much like the bolts of the Russian SKS carbine and French MAS-49 series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the <b>gas</b> <b>plug,</b> to allow for the firing of rifle grenades and manual operation. The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed stock versions of the FAL, the recoil spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.|$|E
50|$|When the L85A1 and L86A1 {{were first}} sent into major combat during the Gulf War, {{individual}} performance was appalling. The L85A1 proved unreliable in semi-auto mode, and slightly better in full-auto, while the L86A1 performed the opposite. Specific complaints included: the poor quality plastic furniture fell apart {{and the gun}} was damaged easily; the magazine release catch was easily knocked accidentally and dropped the magazine; the catch on the housing over the gas mechanism was too weak and constantly popped open, so {{it had to be}} taped down; only 26-28 rounds could be loaded in a magazine because the springs were weak, and it also had to be kept very clean and the lips checked for dents; the LSW had a small magazine capacity for its role and overheated after 120-150 rounds fired in bursts; the weapons were difficult to strip and reassemble, with the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> easily jamming in place and requiring an armorer to remove; and ergonomic issues related to the safety catch, cocking lever, and the location and stiffness of the fire selector switch.|$|E

A more accurate correction factor can be obtained using Knudsen correction.

50|$|Separators {{should be}} {{operated}} above hydrate-formation temperature. Otherwise hydrates may {{form in the}} vessel and partially or completely plug it thereby reducing {{the capacity of the}} separator. In some instances when the liquid or <b>gas</b> outlet is <b>plugged</b> or restricted, this causes the safety valve to open or the safety head to rupture. Steam coils can be installed in the liquid section of oil and gas separators to melt hydrates that may form there. This is especially appropriate on low-temperature separators.|$|R
5000|$|The first engines {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} encourage scavenging were the Crossley 'scavenging engines' designed by Atkinson in the early 1890s. These were soon after Crossley's gas engines had adopted poppet valves rather than their earlier slide valves, which allowed more flexible control over valve timing events. They had exceptionally late exhaust valve closing, over 30° after that of earlier engines, giving a long overlap period when both valves were open together. As these were gas engines they did not require much compression or {{a long period of}} valve closure during the compression stroke. To drive the waste gases through the cylinder during this period they assumed the 'vacuum piston' model of exhaust, where a slug of exhaust gas moving down an exhaust pipe was expected to suck further gasses after it. This model assumed that an exhaust pipe needed to be long enough to contain the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> for the entire duration of the stroke. As the Crossley engine was so slow-revving, this needed an exhaust pipe of a considerable [...] between the engine and its cast-iron 'pot' silencer.|$|E
50|$|The REC7 {{outfitted}} in a shortened barrel PDW configuration {{was one of}} {{the weapons}} displayed to U.S. Army officials during an invitation-only Industry Day on November 13, 2008. The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 carbine.The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices {{do not need to be}} zeroed after routine maintenance.The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.|$|E
40|$|Several {{observers}} report transient ultraviolet brightenings, {{often referred}} to as microflares, in the solar atmosphere. In this paper, the results are presented of a series of one-dimensional numerical simulations examining possible relationships between microflares and the generation of dynamical chromospheric and transition region features. Low-energy and medium-energy microflares eject long-lived cool, dense gas plugs into the corona, with the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> traversing the loop apex in the medium energy case. In the case of high-energy microflares, the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> is rapidly heated to the temperature of the surrounding corona, and the results resemble the dynamics occurring in standard solar flare thick-target electron beam models...|$|E
40|$|Conformal TiN {{films were}} {{deposited}} by thermal low-pressure-chemical-vapor-deposition (LPCVD) in a rotating disk reactor, using TiCl 4 and NH 3 with N 2 as a dilution <b>gas.</b> TiN <b>plug</b> with 0. 05 mm contact size was achieved. No void formation {{was observed in}} the TiN plug. The result demonstrated that LPCVD-TiN {{can be used to}} fill very small contact holes. The excellent step coverage and uniformity resulted from a surface-reaction-rate-limited deposition. The resistivity of TiN film was reduced to 133 mQcm by in-situ NH 3 plasma post-treatment. The concentration of chlorine in the TiN film was measured to be less than 2 atomic % (at. %) by Auger electron spectroscope measurement. For Al deposited on TiN, the Al orientation was found to be dependent on the deposition method of Al film, but not on the underlying Ti...|$|R
50|$|In the Marine Corps, the M240G is the {{predecessor}} of the M240B. The main {{differences between the}} two machine-gun variations is the picatinny rail system, hydraulic buffer inside of the butt stock {{to reduce the amount of}} recoil felt by the gunner, and the number of gas settings on the <b>gas</b> regulator <b>plug.</b> The M240G has three gas settings, allowing the machine gun to have a fire rate between 650-950 rounds per minute depending on the setting selected, whereas the M240B only has one setting, restricting the fire rate between 550-650 rounds per minute. The smaller gas port used on the M240B slows down the rate of fire, which increases the longevity of the machine-gun by reducing stresses on the action. A side effect is a weapon that will not fire when extremely dirty as the energy on the piston is reduced. The Marine Corps relies on fire discipline among its machine gunners to not set it to the largest port unless required.|$|R
500|$|The {{principle}} of the fusible plug is also applied to the transport of liquefied petroleum <b>gases,</b> where fusible <b>plugs</b> (or small, exposed patches of the containers' lining membrane) are designed to melt or become porous if too high a temperature is reached: a controlled release, at a typical temperature of 250 °F (120 °C), is preferable to an explosive release (a [...] "BLEVE") at a higher temperature. Corrosive gas containers, such as those used for liquid chlorine, are fitted {{with one or more}} fusible plugs with an operating temperature [...] of about 158 to 165°F (70–74°C).|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{and explain}} {{a simple and}} efficient way to remove gas bubbles from liquid-filled microchannels, by integrating a hydrophobic porous membrane {{on top of the}} microchannel. A prototype chip is manufactured in hard, transparent polymer with the ability to completely filter gas plugs out of a segmented flow at rates up to 7. 4 microliter/s per mm 2 of membrane area. The device involves a bubble generation section and a gas removal section. In the bubble generation section, a T-junction is used to generate a train of gas plugs into a water stream. These gas plugs are then transported towards the gas removal section, where they slide along a hydrophobic membrane until complete removal. The system has been successfully modeled and four necessary operating criteria have been determined to achieve a complete separation of the gas from the liquid. The first criterion is that the bubble length needs to be larger than the channel diameter. The second criterion is that the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> should stay on the membrane for a time sufficient to transport all the gas through the membrane. The third criterion is that the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> travel speed should be lower than a critical value: otherwise a stable liquid film between the bubble and the membrane prevents mass transfer. The fourth criterion is that the pressure difference across the membrane should not be larger than the Laplace pressure to prevent water from leaking through the membrane...|$|E
30|$|The D/H {{ratio of}} the {{sublimation}} cascades suggests that this layer of enriched ice is thin compared to the thickness of ice that is consumed by a cascade. This can be shown by assuming that {{a significant amount of}} material is rapidly vaporized. If the enriched layer is small, on the average, this material will have close to a bulk composition. But since it is trapped underneath the dust lag by significant backpressure, HDO will recondense until the <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> D/H ratio is equal to the value given by KIE. This gas then makes its way through the dust lag and is fractionated further, emerging with a D/H value close to 0.025 which is close to the peak values of D/H observed for these cascades.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the special}} {{structure}} of offshore multiphase pipes, {{it is easy for}} severe slugging to occur in the riser at low gas-liquid velocity. Violent pressure fluctuations and dramatic changes of flow rate are the main characteristics of severe slugging, leading to the risk of serious damage. In this paper, the separator control is adopted to accurately control the separator liquid level and pressure under severe slugging flow conditions. This indicates that the separator liquid level control alone does not {{have a significant impact on}} the upstream flow, but it is beneficial for normal operation and pressure control of the separator. As the separator pressure increases, the peak pressure in the riser apparently diminishes, and the amplitude of pressure fluctuation gradually decreases, which means that severe slugging is inhibited. During the slug blowing out, the gas/liquid slipping in the riser intensifies. The long <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> quickly flows through the riser, and then tends to morph into short and slowly flowing gas bubbles. The elimination effect of the pressure control strategy on severe slugging is related to the relative rate of the superficial gas/liquid flow.|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} by Germany's Federal Council {{to phase out}} petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 {{is at odds with}} the government's investment in renewable energy, which is not enough to produce the extra power that electric cars will need. We show how natural <b>gas</b> could <b>plug</b> the gap. Replacing internal-combustion vehicles with electric cars would reduce Germany's primary energy needs by 60 %, from about 570 terawatt-hours (TWh) to about 230 TWh (detailed calculations available from the authors). However, the government's brake on renewables, mainly to protect stability of the electricity grid, means that only 63 TWh will come online by 2030 (see also Nature 534, 152; 2016). Making up the deficit with electricity generated by burning natural gas would create 131 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which would still save 30 million tonnes on 2014 road-transport emissions. To decarbonize its transport sector entirely — and to meet the shortfall under its plan to phase out nuclear energy by 2030 — Germany will need to step up production of renewable energy and develop smart storage grids...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of sorbent injection and in-flight mercury capture is presented.

40|$|An {{extended}} {{film thickness}} measurement method that can obtain the liquid film thickness {{profile of the}} whole plug bubble in a capillary tube simultaneously is presented. The approach {{is based on a}} 2 D spatial fringe scattering technique, where the spatial frequency of scattered fringes is a function of liquid film thickness along the micropipe. Laser sheets are used instead of the laser beams, and the width of the laser sheets can be selected to cover the whole measurement field. Capillary tubes, with inner diameters of 1. 0 mm and 0. 3 mm, and lengths of 125 mm and 65 mm, are used. A <b>gas</b> <b>plug</b> bubble, 2. 5 - 20 mm long, is introduced and moves through the testing part of the tube, which is filled with water as the working fluid. The interference fringes produced by two incident laser sheets are scattered from the interface between gas and water, and captured by a high-speed camera at a speed of up to 2000 frames s(- 1). The experimental results show that the improved method can obtain the liquid film thickness profile at the different times and can be used to analyze the status of the plug bubble movement in a micropipe...|$|E

40|$|Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) {{are used}} to manage the risk of <b>gas</b> hydrate <b>plug</b> {{formation}} in oil and gas transmission pipelines and facilities. However, under severe conditions, hydrates can be formed {{in the presence of}} these additives. It is important to understand how these inhibitors would affect gas hydrate remediation. Here, the impact of different concentrations of polyvinylcaprolactam (PVCap), Luvicap Bio and type III antifreeze proteins (AFP III) on the dissociation of propane hydrate formed in the presence of these additives has been evaluated using a high pressure micro differential scanning calorimeter. Remarkably, hydrates formed in the presence of these inhibitors were dissociated at different temperatures than those expected from hydrate equilibrium calculations as well as at higher temperatures. However, gas hydrates formed in KHI-free solution melted at the equilibrium temperature and multiple-melting points were not observed. Interestingly, an increase in inhibitor concentration decreased the amount of gas hydrate that dissociated at the equilibrium temperature. Consequently, larger amounts of hydrate were dissociated at higher temperatures. These results indicate that since remediation of hydrates in the presence of KHIs requires higher melting temperatures, more energy is required to remove hydrates under these conditions. Such an effect should be considered in the design of processes for flow assurance. In press: YesPeer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Scale {{deposition}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and serious problems which water injection systems are generally engaged in.

The experimental results confirm the general trend in solubility dependencies for common oil field scales at these conditions. At higher temperatures the deposition of CaCO 3, CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scale increases and the deposition of BaSO 4 scale decreases since the solubilities of CaCO 3, CaSO 4 and SrSO 4 scales decreases and the solubility of BaSO 4 increases with increasing temperature...|$|R
30|$|FAWAG may be {{implemented}} {{to solve the}} persistent challenge of high gas mobility during WAG. Foam reduces the <b>gas</b> mobility by <b>plugging</b> high permeability ‘thief’ zones, and hence delays gas breakthrough and reduces the GOR. Since FAWAG is limited by oil saturation, above 20 %, the scheme may be initiated after a WAG or SWAG schemes when the residual oil saturation has reduced to desired levels. High oil saturations encourage coalescence of the foam bubbles as the oil interacts with the foam and depletes its stability. High temperatures above 100  °C may degrade the foam. In the North Sea, high salinity of sea injection waters, high adsorption rates of expensive chemicals, and high reservoir temperatures have limited field foam applications. The reservoir temperatures may be controlled by injecting cool sea water, and salinity may be reduced by mixing the sea water with fresh make-up water.|$|R
