50|$|Also, the six-stroke roll {{is often}} used in snare solo and marching {{percussion}} situations and is a favorite for jazz and rock drummers.

5000|$|The open roll (or [...] "double-stroke roll") {{is played}} with <b>double</b> <b>strokes</b> {{alternating}} between {{the left and}} right hands. Using a forearm stroke for the first and the fingers for the second stroke, the 2 strokes can be made to sound identical. This produces a near-continuous sound when the technique is mastered.|$|R
50|$|The Fire Hall {{was built}} in 1904 to house the town's two {{hand-drawn}} fire pumpers.

5000|$|In modern times, {{this method}} has been {{implemented}} into various styles of music such as Drum and bass by artist like Jojo Mayer, {{as well as}} the Heavy metal music genre by drummers such as, John Longstreth, of Origin (band) where the heel-toe technique is used to play the <b>double</b> <b>stroke</b> roll Drum rudiment on both feet.

5000|$|Drum rudiments {{seem to have}} {{developed}} with the snare drum; the Swiss fife and drum groups are sometimes credited with their invention.

2500|$|More recently, the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) {{guidelines}} {{have recommended}} {{a risk factor}} based approach to stroke prevention, and de-emphasised the artificial stratification into low/moderate/high risk, given the poor predictive value of these 3 categories.

25|$|Strokes {{are further}} {{divided into four}} {{categories}} of motion. Single Independent strokes involve moving the inside or outside mallets singly, pivoting around the shaft of the unused mallet. Single Alternating strokes are used in single note patterns to be played by the same hand, alternating the inside and outside mallets. <b>Double</b> Vertical <b>strokes</b> are used in playing double notes simultaneously by the same hand. <b>Double</b> Lateral <b>strokes</b> are used for fast, rhythmically adjacent notes to be played by the same hand.|$|R
50|$|Tangos is {{only vaguely}} related to Argentine tango, and objectively they only share compás binario or <b>double</b> <b>stroke</b> rhythm. The fact that Argentine tango {{is one of}} the first couple dances in America has led historians to believe that both could be based in a minuet-style European dance, {{therefore}} sharing a common ancestor, while those who compare the present day forms do not see them as related.|$|E
5000|$|... dragA drag is a <b>double</b> <b>stroke</b> {{played at}} twice the speed of their {{context in which they}} are placed. For example, if a sixteenth-note passage is being played then any drags in that passage would consist of thirty-second notes. Drags can also be played as grace notes. When played as grace notes on timpani, the drag becomes three single (alternating) strokes (rlR or lrL).|$|E

2500|$|Four-mallet vibists usually play scalar linear {{passages}} {{much the}} same as two-mallet players, using one mallet from each hand (outside right and inside left for Burton grip), except four-mallet players tend to make more use of <b>double</b> <b>strokes,</b> not only to avoid crossing hands but also to minimize motion between the two bar rows. For example, an ascending E flat major scale could be played L-R-R-L-L-R-R-L, keeping the left hand on the [...] "black" [...] bars and the right hand on the [...] "white".
