40|$|This {{report will}} help the Tasmanian {{community}} be better prepared for, respond to and recover from natural disasters through an updated understanding and awareness of the natural hazards that have the most potential to impact the State. The information contained in this report, including the risk register and risk treatment options together with the accompanying all hazard summary report, {{can be used by}} stakeholders and practitioners throughout the emergency management sector to inform emergency management planning. This report assesses the State level risks posed by Bushfire, Flood, Severe Storm, Landslide, Tsunami, Earthquake, Heatwave, Coastal Inundation and Pandemic Influenza. Bushfire remains the greatest aggregated risk to Tasmania. It is a &# 039;High&# 039; or &# 039;Extreme&# 039; risk across all sectors of society, often with catastrophic consequences expected every 30 years (i. e. &# 039;Unlikely&# 039; likelihood). This likelihood is expected to become more frequent with climate change. Land-use planning and building systems are strong and effective controls for each of the hazards apart from Pandemic Influenza. Limiting future development and vulnerability in known &# 039;at risk&# 039; areas is considered to be the most effectve way of protecting life and property while limiting future government liability. A &# 039;multi-hazards&# 039; approach to exercises and business continuity planning within government was agreed to be an important treatment option, with hazard-specific training recommended for <b>key</b> incident <b>management</b> <b>personnel</b> (e. g. incident controllers) as well as formalising the arrangements to guide decision-makers in times of crisis to ensure rapid decision...|$|R

Not only did Narayan Murthy return to Infosys, he came with his son Rohan Murthy. IiAS argued that Infosys had compromised the very principles it strongly advocated during its rise to the top: having a retirement age for directors (both executive and non-executive), and that founders’ children must not take up executive roles. But, following an exodus of <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>personnel,</b> Infosys appointed Dr. Vishal Sikka as CEO and Managing Director in 2014. Narayan Murthy and Rohan Murthy (whose term was co-terminus with Narayan Murthy) stepped down from Infosys upon Dr. Sikka’s joining the board. At {{the time of his}} appointment to lead Infosys, Dr. Vishal Sikka was possibly one of the highest paid professionals in India, with an estimated compensation (including restricted stock options) of around US$7.1 million. IiAS recommended that shareholders vote for Dr. Sikka’s appointment and his remuneration. [...] IiAS reckoned that Infosys' decision to appoint Dr. Sikka must be looked at as an investment in its leadership that will bear returns in the future. Additionally, over 80% of his total remuneration, including restricted stock, was variable and based on target achievement.|$|E
