40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp, or the low beam headlamp plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the low beam headlamp illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary <b>lamps</b> or modulated <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated low beam headlamp may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R

Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with that from full-power low beams. The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> as a function of increased mounting height. The analyses were based on photometric information from five <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> and 43 low <b>beams</b> from <b>lamps</b> manufactured for the United States market.

The results indicate that allowing reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with mounting heights between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> at a mounting height of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power low beams...|$|R
