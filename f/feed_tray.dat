500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E

The charging handle will then be pulled to the rear, which locks the bolt to the rear. The weapon is then placed on safe and the charging handle is then placed back to the forward position (this is spring-loaded on the tank-mounted variation). The weapon is now ready for operation.|$|E

40|$|When foraging, {{animals can}} {{maximize}} their fitness {{if they are}} able to tailor their foraging decisions to current environmental conditions. When making foraging decisions, individuals need to assess the benefits of foraging while accounting for the potential risks of being captured by a predator. However, whether and how different factors interact to shape these decisions is not yet well understood, especially in individual foragers. Here we present a standardized set of manipulative field experiments in the form of foraging assays in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus in Puerto Rico. We presented male lizards with foraging opportunities to test how the presence of conspecifics, predation-risk perception, the abundance of food, and interactions among these factors determines the outcome of foraging decisions. In Experiment 1, anoles foraged faster when food was scarce and other conspecifics were present near the <b>feeding</b> <b>tray,</b> while they took longer to feed when food was abundant and when no conspecifics were present. These results suggest that foraging decisions in anoles are the result of a complex process in which individuals assess predation risk by using information from conspecific individuals while taking into account food abundance. In Experiment 2, a simulated increase in predation risk (i. e., distance to the <b>feeding</b> <b>tray)</b> confirmed the relevance of risk perception by showing that the use of available perches is strongly correlated with the latency to feed. We found Puerto Rican crested anoles integrate instantaneous ecological information about food abundance, conspecific activity and predation risk, and adjust their foraging behavior accordingly...|$|R

50|$|The {{weapon is}} fed from the {{left-hand}} side by disintegrating-link M27 ammunition belts (a miniaturized version of the 7.62mm M13 belt), from either an unsupported loose belt, enclosed in a polymer ammunition box with a 200-round capacity attached {{to the base of}} the receiver, or from detachable STANAG magazines, used in other NATO 5.56 mm assault rifles such as the M16 and FNC. Magazine feeding is used only as an auxiliary measure, when belted ammunition has been exhausted. The ammunition belt is introduced into the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> magazines are seated inside the magazine port at a 45° angle, located beneath the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> port. When a belt is placed in the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> it covers the magazine port. Likewise, a magazine inserted into the magazine well will prevent the simultaneous insertion of a belt. The magazine port, when not in use, is closed with an L-shaped hinged flap equipped with a tooth, which engages a corresponding opening in the magazine and serves as a magazine release. This feature was developed by FN's Maurice V. Bourlet and allows the Minimi to be instantly changed from belt feed to magazine feed without any modification.|$|E

50|$|The Barrett 240LWS {{features}} a removable and telescoping buttstock, that can has 6 adjustable positions. It {{differs from the}} buttstock of the 240LW by being half of its size in length, and doesn't have a polymer cheek piece. There are two telescoping rods that allows the buttstock to be extended to the desired position, when depressed from the top portion. The rods have indentations on them, which lock into positional latches within {{the rear of the}} buttstock. The hydraulic buffer is permanently encased within the stock and is necessary for recoil reduction from the reciprocating movement of the bolt group. Early prototypes had steel QD sling sockets {{on both sides of the}} stock, however current production versions will have solid steel sling loops on either side of it. This is to alleviate any damage that may occur to a sling mounted on the QD socket, and the amount of stress that it could take while carrying the machine gun. It also {{features a}} Picatinny rail that is longer compared to the Picatinny rail of the M240 machine guns, and where the Barrett M107A1 rear sight can be mounted and other various optics. The design of the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover hinge has been altered to be in the shape of a hexagon, thus allowing for the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover to be able to stay open while at a 45 degree angle to the receiver, while the machine gunner is loading a belt of ammunition. The <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> has also been altered, with two protruding spring-loaded teeth which can bend in the direction of the ammunition belt. These teeth allows the operator to securely place a belt of ammunition on the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> while at an upright angle, and not have the belt slip out while closing the cover. In addition they allow the operator to be able to squeeze the front of the belt into a closed cover because the teeth only bends in the direction of the belt, and the belt will pass over them, then the teeth will click upwards, thus locking the belt in place. Another click forward, and the belt of ammunition will be in place to fire. This allows the operator to feed a belt of ammunition into his 240LWS without ever having to possibly expose his position or line of sight, by opening the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover.|$|E

40|$|The feeding {{strategy}} used in {{the commercial}} culture of shrimp can {{have a significant impact}} on pond water quality and hence growth, health and survival of the shrimp, as well as the efficiency of feed utilization. These factors contribute to the profitability of production and to the environmental impact of shrimp farming. The effect of four different feeding frequencies (3, 4, 5 and 6 feedings day- 1) on the growth and survival of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, and water quality was studied in an 8 -week growth trial. The shrimp were held in 20 ײ 500 -l outdoor tanks containing water and sediment from a shrimp pond. The water management and aeration strategies were designed to simulate a shrimp pond system. The shrimp (initial weight of 5. 6 g) were stocked at a density of 25 animals m- 2 and fed a widely used, commercial pelleted feed, with all the feed being placed on <b>feeding</b> <b>trays.</b> The uneaten <b>feed</b> on the <b>feeding</b> <b>trays</b> was removed at specific time intervals so that in all treatments, the shrimp had access to the feed for 12 h day- 1. There were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences due to feeding frequency on growth rate (1. 4 ᰮ 08 g week- 1), feed conversion ratio (FCR) (2. 0 ᰮ 27) or survival (84 ᷮ 6 %) of shrimp. Similarly, the water quality parameters (total N, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, dissolved organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, phosphate, chlorophyll a, oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity) were not different among treatments. The results suggest that there is no benefit from feeding P. monodon more frequently than 3 times day- 1 when using a feed that is nutritionally adequate and has high water stability. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce feeding frequency in commercial shrimp ponds without adversely affecting water quality, shrimp growth rate and survival, thereby improving farm profitability.

40|$|Problems met in countercurrent {{separation}} {{units have}} been solved {{by means of}} a proper combination of two different models, referred to as sure and fast, to describe the whole set of theoretical stages. The "sure" model is employed for trays showing particular features, or disturbances, i. e. <b>feed</b> <b>trays,</b> partial condensers, reboilers, side cuts, intercoolers, etc. as well as for trays adjacent to the previous ones. This model is written in terms of single theoretical tray equations. The "fast" model is applied to multitray sections, provided that no "disturbance" exists, with an assumption that molar flowrates and temperatures vary according to prefixed laws. The adoption of effective K-values allows one to use formally the same operating equations for the multitray sections as for single theroretical trays. A Newton-Raphson procedure, combined with a B. P. method, is employed to converge the set of equations describing the problem. © 1982...|$|R

5000|$|As the {{assembly}} of bolt, barrel and barrel extension recoiled {{to the rear of}} the gun upon firing, the locking block was drawn out of engagement by a cam in the bottom of the gun's receiver. The recoiling barrel extension struck the [...] "accelerator" [...] assembly, a half-moon shaped spring-loaded piece of metal pivoting from the receiver below the bolt and behind the barrel extension. The tips of the accelerator's two curving fingers engaged the bottom of the bolt and caused it to move rapidly to the rear. The extractor-ejector was a mechanism that pivoted over the front of the bolt, with a claw that gripped the base of the next round in the belt. A camming track in the left side of the receiver caused this to move down as the bolt moved back, lowering the next round down on top of the fired case, pushing it straight down out of the extraction grooves of the bolt face through the ejection port. A spring in the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover pushed the extractor-ejector down onto the next round, so if the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> cover was opened, the extractor-ejector would be pulled upwards if the belt needed to be removed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIt is {{generally}} believed that increasing feeding frequency has immediate benefits, including reduced nutrient leaching and increased shrimp growth. In this context, the aim {{this work was}} to evaluate the effect of feeding frequency in growth performance of Farfantepenaeus paulensis. Juveniles of Farfantepenaeus paulensis were grown for 30 days in pen enclosures, at a stocking density of 5 shrimp/m 2. The shrimp were fed on <b>feeding</b> <b>trays</b> {{at a rate of}} 8 % of their biomass per day, with treatments of one, two, three and four times per day, with four replicates each. The results showed no differences (5 % probability) in biomass gain of F. paulensis when feed was offered two, three or four times per day. However, it was observed that the once a day frequency had a negative influence on weight gain for this species of shrimp. We conclude that the supply of food with 35 % crude protein twice a day is sufficient for the growth of F paulensis. Feeding frequency of three or four times can provide increased spending in the cultivation of juveniles of this species...|$|R
40|$|In {{distillation}} columns with condenser temperatures significantly below room temperature, {{such as in}} demethanizer towers, {{it is essential to}} minimize the expensive energy requirements of the refrigeration cycle that produces the tower reflux. A partial solution can be found by expanding the gaseous distillate to decrease its temperature; another solution is to use the cooler distillate to reduce the temperature of the tower feed. In this way, {{it has been shown that}} precooling only part of the feed brings about a significant decrease of its temperature, as well as decreases of the related minimum reflux ratio and finally the condenser duty. The fraction of the precooled feed has an optimum value that must be determined by means of a sensitivity analysis. By repeating the simulation of the tower and its auxiliaries, it is possible to find the optimal configuration, i. e., the configuration that minimizes the energy requirements at the condenser, by varying the feed-splitting ratio and by adjusting the tower geometry (i. e., identity of the <b>feed</b> <b>trays)</b> for each trial.

The variables considered in this study are the thermodynamic model option, top and bottom temperatures, feed temperature, feed composition & reflux ratio. Also simulated columns profiles for the temperature, vapor & liquid flow rates compositions, were constructed. Four different thermodynamic models options (SRK, TSRK, PR, and ESSO) were used, affecting the results within 1 - 25 % variation for the most cases.              For Benzene Column (32 real stages, feed stage 14), the simulated results show that bottom temperature above 200 o C the weight fractions of top components, except benzene, increases sharply, where as benzene top weight fraction decreasing sharply.

50|$|Clearing {{the weapon}} is {{performed}} {{by ensuring that}} the bolt is locked to the rear and the weapon is on safe. The top cover is then lifted, the remaining belt (if any) is swept out of the <b>feed</b> <b>tray,</b> the <b>feed</b> <b>tray</b> is lifted to visually inspect the chamber and {{the face of the}} bolt. Any links or brass casings are removed. The weapon is now clear. In the extremely unlikely event that a live round is on the bolt face, it is knocked loose with a cleaning rod or another rigid object. If there is a live round lodged in the barrel, the operator must immediately decide if the barrel is hot enough that there is a chance of it cooking off. If there is, he will immediately move his face away from the opening of the weapon; and aiming the gun is a direction that is perceived to take the least amount of damage and/or casualties should the event of a cook-off occur. He should then wait for the barrel to cool off before attempting to remove it. He can also attempt to extract the round by closing the cover, taking the weapon off of safe, and pulling the trigger. This will likely causing the weapon to fire, so care should be made in ensuring that the weapon is first pointed in a safe direction.|$|E

40|$|A {{majority}} of the arid grasslands in the western U. S. have been dramatically altered by anthropogenic influences resulting in degradation and desertification. Within the arid grasslands of North America a guild of burrowing herbivorous rodents that includes kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) and prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) is often considered integral to arid grassland maintenance. As {{part of the larger}} guild of burrowing herbivorous rodents, kangaroo rats are considered to be an important keystone guild whose role as ecosystem engineers and habitat modifiers complements that of prairie dogs. Together these species organize and structure arid grassland ecosystems and the biodiversity therein, by providing a mosaic of microhabitat patches, thus increasing overall heterogeneity. In an area where black-tailed prairie dogs (C. ludovicianus) were reintroduced, I used Giving-up Density (GUD) to assess the indirect effects black-tailed prairie dogs might have on the foraging patterns of resident kangaroo rats (D. spectabilis and D. merriamii). My objective was to compare and contrast kangaroo rat foraging GUD within and along the boundary of a on a recently established black-tailed prairie dog colony with that in the surrounding unmodified native habitat. This enabled assessment of whether black-tailed prairie dogs had an influence on the perceived quality of the habitat by kangaroo rats. Kangaroo rats visited off-colony <b>feeding</b> <b>trays</b> more frequently, and collected a greater mean mass of seed per tray as well. This indicates that the kangaroo rats perceived the area off the prairie dog colony as having a lower foraging cost than on the colony or along the colony edge. I conclude that {{from the perspective of the}} seed-eating kangaroo rat, the colony is not viewed as high quality habitat.

40|$|Many {{species of}} tsetse flies are {{infected}} by {{a virus that}} causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) syndrome and the virus isolated from Glossina pallidipes (GpSGHV) has recently been sequenced. Flies with SGH have a reduced fecundity and fertility. Due to the deleterious impact of SGHV on G. pallidipes colonies, several approaches were investigated to develop a virus management strategy. Horizontal virus transmission is the major cause of the high prevalence of the GpSGHV in tsetse colonies. Implementation of a "clean feeding" regime (fresh blood offered to each set of flies {{so that there is}} only one feed per membrane), instead of the regular feeding regime (several successive feeds per membrane), was among the proposed approaches to reduce GpSGHV infections. However, due to the absence of disposable <b>feeding</b> equipment (<b>feeding</b> <b>trays</b> and silicone membranes), the implementation of a clean feeding approach remains economically difficult. We developed a new clean feeding approach applicable to large-scale tsetse production facilities using existing resources. The results indicate that implementing this approach is feasible and leads to a significant reduction in virus load from 10 (9) virus copies in regular colonies to an average of 10 (2. 5) and eliminates the SGH syndrome from clean feeding colonies by 28 months post implementation of this approach. The clean feeding approach also reduced the virus load from an average of 10 (8) virus copy numbers to an average of 10 (3) virus copies and SGH prevalence of 10 % to 4 % in flies fed after the clean fed colony. Taken together, these data indicate that the clean feeding approach is applicable in large-scale G. pallidipes production facilities and eliminates the deleterious effects of the virus and the SGH syndrome in these colonies...|$|R
