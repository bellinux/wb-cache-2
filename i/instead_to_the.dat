5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts to pass an economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E

It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota Senator Peter Norbeck also {{introduced}} legislation for a Norse-American medal on February 5, 1925. It {{was referred to}} the Committee on the Library. On the 6th, that committee was discharged {{of responsibility for the}} bill and it was referred <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Committee on Banking and Currency. Norbeck, on behalf of the Banking Committee, reported the bill favorably and without amendment to the Senate on February 13. It was passed by the Senate without objection or amendment on the 18th.|$|E

5|$|Stephen {{was furious}} {{over what he}} saw as {{potentially}} precedent-setting papal interference in his royal authority, and initially refused to allow Murdac into England. When Theobald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, went to consult with the Pope on the matter against Stephen's wishes, the King refused to allow him back into England either, and seized his estates. Stephen also cut his links to the Cistercian order, and turned <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cluniacs, of which Henry was a member.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers {{engaged in the}} Great War—France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia—suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.|$|E
5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of its}} line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status Indians to visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E
5|$|Aves and {{a sister}} group, the clade Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most {{commonly}} defined phylogenetically as all descendants {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the Phylocode system. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, <b>instead,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Avialae, in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of Archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.|$|E

Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E

But as {{he wished to}} attend an American university, he went <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Omaha Lancers of the United States Hockey League (USHL) where he spent the 2008–09 season, playing in 60 games and finishing with 28 goals and 31 assists for 59 points. He led the team in points scored and tied for tenth overall in the USHL; his goal total was tied for eighth overall, and the six game-winning goals Leblanc scored were tied for second overall. In recognition of his performance that season, the USHL named him the league's rookie of the year.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{had been}} {{specific}} in letters to Hagenauer {{that the family}} would not visit the Dutch Republic, but would go to Paris and then return home to Salzburg. However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Hague and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell sick with tonsillitis, then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; {{a few days later}} he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Long {{was elected}} to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E

5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some of the views of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and asked that his contributed funds be donated <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over the overt politicization of the event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The four {{lanes of}} I-35E pass through {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{in the center}} of the six lanes of I-94, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E—exit107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit107B from I-35E south to I-94 west—takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the common segment, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west or I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway10 (US10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, and truck traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|On 18 May Ursúa {{requested}} three missionaries {{to support}} the expedition from the Franciscan provincial superior, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother {{who had not yet}} taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakb'ajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktok', near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakb'ajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Ch'ol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him <b>instead</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65miles or 105km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real ("Royal Road") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué. On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.|$|E
