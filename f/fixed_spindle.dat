They are typically much more powerful than a turret mill, featuring a separate hydraulic motor for integral hydraulic power feeds in all directions, and a twenty to fifty horsepower motor. Backlash eliminators are almost always standard equipment. They use large NMTB 40 or 50 tooling. The tables on C-frame mills are usually 18" [...] by 68" [...] or larger, to allow multiple parts to be machined at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Spindle speed becomes {{important}} {{in the operation of}} routers, spindle moulders or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> speed, usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small router bits, using larger bits, say more than 1 in or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. Drilling wood generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.|$|E
50|$|The full-floating {{design is}} {{typically}} used in most 3/4- and 1-ton light trucks, medium duty trucks and heavy-duty trucks, {{as well as}} most agricultural applications, such as large tractors and self-propelled agricultural machinery. There are a few exceptions, such as many Land-Rover vehicles and in American stock car racing since the early 1960s. The overall assembly can carry more weight than a semi-floating or non-floating axle assembly, because the hubs have two bearings riding on a <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle.</b> A full-floating axle can be identified by a protruding hub to which the axle shaft flange is bolted. The semi-floating design is found under most 1/2-ton and lighter trucks and SUVs and rear-wheel-drive passenger cars, usually being smaller or less expensive models.|$|E
40|$|Drosophila neuroblasts divide asymmetrically by {{aligning}} their {{mitotic spindle}} with cortical cell polarity to generate distinct sibling cell types. Neuroblasts asymmetrically localize Gαi, Pins, and Mud proteins; Pins/Gαi direct cortical polarity, whereas Mud {{is required for}} spindle orientation. It is currently unknown how Gαi–Pins–Mud binding is regulated to link cortical polarity with spindle orientation. Here, we show that Pins forms a “closed” state via intramolecular GoLoco–tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) interactions, which regulate Mud binding. Biochemical, genetic, and live imaging experiments show that Gαi binds to {{the first of three}} Pins GoLoco motifs to recruit Pins to the apical cortex without “opening” Pins or recruiting Mud. However, Gαi and Mud bind cooperatively to the Pins GoLocos 2 / 3 and tetratricopeptide repeat domains, respectively, thereby restricting Pins–Mud interaction to the apical cortex and <b>fixing</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation. We conclude that Pins has multiple activity states that generate cortical polarity and link it with mitotic spindle orientation...|$|R

50|$|Bicycle frames {{utilizing}} pressed bearing standards do {{not have}} any threads inside the bottom bracket shell. The bottom bracket is pressed directly into the frame. Using pressed in standards allows frame manufacturers greater flexibility in frame design that many times offers greater stiffness and weight reductions. The current pressed-bearing standards (and developed by) are: BB30 (Cannondale), PF30 (SRAM), BB90 & BB95 (Trek), BB86 & BB92 (Shimano), BB79 (Cervelo’s BBRight), and BB386EVO (FSA and BH bicycles). In BB30, BB90 & BB95 systems: the bearings are pressed directly into the frame. For PF30, BB86 & BB92, BB79, and BB386EVO; the bearing is housed in a nylon plastic cup that is pressed into the frame’s bottom bracket shell. Pressed in standards usually require two-piece cranksets where the spindle is attached to one of the crankarms. Due to <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> length and diameter, cranksets designed for one pressed standard may not be compatible with another. For example, a crankset made specifically for BB30 will not fit in a BB86 bottom bracket and frame. There are other instances where adapters can be used to fit a crankset made for one standard into another. For example, a Shimano (two piece Hollowtech II 24mm OD spindle) road crankset can fit into a BB30 bottom bracket shell (42mm ID) using aftermarket adapters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEstimation of {{incremental}} {{sheet forming}} force {{is required in}} order to design dedicated equipment, utilize adapted machinery or develop online process control strategies. In the present work, forces on Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) of variable wall angle geometry were studied under different bending conditions. The effect of several process parameters was analyzed. The results demonstrated that the maximum forming force increases with the tool diameter and the step down while for higher spindle speeds the forming force decreases. The last effect is due to the higher friction between the tool and the blank when using a <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> speed, which causes an increase of the forming temperature. The forming force evolution, which varies with the bending conditions, could be used as an indicator to prevent the sheet failure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the paper, a new {{polishing}} head is {{researched and}} developed. How {{to set a}} magnetic feild is {{a key factor in}} magnetic-electrochemical compound polishing.

The spindle is driven and the traveller drags behind thus distributing the rotation between winding up on the spindle and twist into the yarn.

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure flank wear of dry milling 6061 aluminum alloy of different PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) multilayer coatings (including TiN, TiCN, and TiAlN) single edge rhombus micro-end-milling tools.

40|$|Abstract. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is {{solid-state}} {{process for}} joining materials by using frictional heat generated due to rotating tool along the weld line. Since its invention about two decades ago, wide spread use of FSW is still restricted due to very expensive purpose built FSW machines {{available in the}} market. As an alternative, a milling machine {{can be used to}} carry out the FSW depending on the capabilities of the machine. In cases where milling machines have a fixed head, limitation of zero degree tool tilt angle results in substantial defects (e. g. tunnel defect) in weldments.

The testing of the fabricated fixture is then carried out by running the FSW experiments at different tilt angles. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and contribute to a better understanding of cutting process characteristics using the proposed RBD Palm Olein-based organic mixed coolant. Design/methodology/approach - In this research, refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) Palm Olein is selected as the base oil for organic coolant and mixed coolant (base oil mixed with chemicals) to compare with the cutting performance of industrial water-soluble chemical (inorganic) coolant. Using coated carbide tool, JIS SS 400 Mild Steel was tested in milling process. At <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> speed, the relations between feed rate and depth of cut (DOC) on cutting temperature and surface roughness were investigated. Also, the dynamic viscosity, specific heat capacity and pH level for each coolant are taken into consideration. Findings - As predicted, cutting fluid with lower viscosity removes more heat. The cutting temperature increased with increasing feed rate and DOC. However, surface roughness increased with increasing feed rate but decreased with increasing DOC. From the data gathered, the proposed RBD Palm Olein-based organic mixed coolant showed better heat removal properties than organic coolant and it produced a far better machined surface than inorganic coolant. Originality/value - Overall, the proposed organic mixed coolant has shown great potential to be a good cutting fluid when balance between cooling properties and lubricity, and consistent quality of cutting fluids are sought to produce environmental friendly quality workpiece...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to establish the dynamic model of a traveling-wave type ultrasonic motor (USM) with beam teeth via finite elements. The modeling is accomplished mainly by finite elements, the task of which consists of three parts – for stator, rotor and contact. It is first assumed that the complex dynamics of the stator emulates a single one-dimensional Euler-beam vibrating harmonically in the transverse direction. On the top surfaces of the stator are vertical beam teeth that is in contact with rotor, which is simply a thin disk <b>fixed</b> to <b>spindle.</b> The friction between the teeth tips and stator rotates the spindle moves the stator and finally rotates the disk to the desired speed. A contact model between beam tips and rotor disk with proper friction assumed is next built {{in conjunction with the}} established finite element model of the rotor disk.

5000|$|Direct {{indexing}} plate: Most dividing heads have an {{indexing plate}} permanently {{attached to the}} spindle. This plate {{is located at the}} end of the spindle, very close to where the work would be mounted. It is <b>fixed</b> to the <b>spindle</b> and rotates with it. This plate is usually equipped with a series of holes that enables rapid indexing to common angles, such as 30, 45, or 90 degrees. A pin in the base of the dividing head can be extended into the direct indexing plate to lock the head quickly into one of these angles. [...] The advantage of the direct indexing plate is that it is fast and simple and no calculations are required to use it. The disadvantage is that it can only be used for a limited number of angles.|$|R

[...] Only one such plate can be mounted to the dividing head at a time. The plate is selected by the machinist based on exactly what angle he wishes to index to.|$|R
40|$|The tire dynamic {{transfer}} stiffness {{describes how}} a displacement enforced at the tire contact patch {{results in a}} force at the spindle-wheel interface. The dynamic transfer stiffness is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior structure-borne tire/road noise. The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the excitation levels during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the excitation levels during operation of the tire. This is not possible with the classic excitation devices such as hammer and electrodynamic shakers. This paper presents an experimental method to obtain the dynamic transfer stiffness of a non-rolling tire which is excited at operational excitation levels. Therefore, a high-frequency 6 -DOF hydraulic shaker table (CUBE R ○) is used to excite the tire. The shaker table provides the static preload and excites the tire at the contact patch in the frequency range 20 - 235 Hz. The force at the <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> is measured by a piezo-electric dynamometer. ...|$|E
40|$|Regenerative chatter is an {{instability}} {{phenomenon in}} machining operation {{that must be}} avoided if high accuracy and greater surface finish is to be achieved. It comes with its own consequences such as poor surface finish, low accuracy, excessive noise, tool wear and low material removal rate (MRR). In this paper, an analytical method base on first order least square approximation full-discretization method is use for the stability analysis on the plane of axial depth and radial depths of cut. A detail computational algorithm has been developed {{for the purpose of}} delineating stability lobe diagram into stable and unstable regions using mathematical models. These algorithms enabled the performance of sensitivity analysis. From the results axial depth of cut enhances the unstable region and suppresses the stable region. This means that inverse relationship exists between the axial and limiting radial depths of cut thus highlighting the need to determine the maximum value of their product for achieving maximized MRR thereby reducing the chatter in the milling process. It is also seen that the peak radial depths of cut occasioned by the lobbing effects occur at <b>fixed</b> <b>spindle</b> speeds irrespective of the axial depth of cut. Similarly, the rise in spindle speed enhances the stable region and suppresses the unstable region. This means that for us to have chatter-free milling process, parameters like axial and radial depths of cut should be carefully selected together at high machining speed. With these behaviour, one can locate the productive spindle speed at which the lobbing effects occur and depths of cut combination for the operator...|$|E

Similarly to taxol, FLUTAX and ROTAX are able to drive inactive GDP-liganded tubulin into microtubule assembly. One molecule of FLUTAX binds per -tubulin dimer assembled, competing with taxol for the same microtubule binding site with an eightfold smaller relative affinity. FLUTAX-induced microtubule elongation is markedly Mg 2 +-dependent, encompassing the binding of one Mg 2 + ion more per tubulin dimer polymerized than {{in the case of}} taxol. A small perturbation of the absorption spectrum of bound FLUTAX is consistent with a cationic microenvironment relative to the solution. The fluorescence anisotropy of FLUTAX increases by an order of magnitude upon binding to microtubules and time-resolved measurements indicate that the fluorescein moiety remains considerably mobile on a protein surface. The rate of labeling suggests that this is the outer microtubule wall. Alternatively, the microtubule lumen would be functional. FLUTAX- and ROTAX-induced microtubules, radial structures, and organized microtubule bundles are readily observed under the fluorescence microscope. Rapid and accurate visualization of native (or very mildly <b>fixed)</b> cytoplasmic and <b>spindle</b> microtubules of a variety of permeabilized cells is simply obtained with micromolar FLUTAX, with an advantage over immunofluorescence. In addition, FLUTAX labels the centrosomes of PtK 2 cells more intensely than antibodies to - or -tubulin, and co-localizing with antibodies to -tubulin. Two brightly fluorescent spots, probably separating or duplicating centrioles, can be resolved in the centrosomes of interphase cells. This finding indicates that centrosomes may well be additional targets of action of taxoids. FLUTAX strongly labels microtubules near the spindle poles, as well as microtubules at the telophase spindle equator and {{the central part of the}} midbody in cytokinesis (instead of the dark zone frequently observed with immunofluorescence), suggesting a predominant interaction of FLUTAX with sites at which tubulin is newly polymerized.
