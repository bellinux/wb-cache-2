40|$|This chapter utilises {{a wealth}} of Irish archival records to present an {{overview}} of Irish female criminality during {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries. It argues that female criminality was as significant as male criminality at the time. It marks {{the first in a series}} of studies of Irish women, first in Ireland and subsequently as migrants to Spain, leading to a monograph in preparation, 'Women of the Wild Geese: Irish Women Migrants in Early Modern Spain'. The work is heavily archival based and has a distinctive urban component. This is an area of women’s history with no previous scholarly activity or publications. The article is a revised and extended version of an invited paper given in the Criminal Justice strand at the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Science History <b>Conference</b> held in Noordwijkerhout, the Netherlands in 1996...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Laumann {{and colleagues}} {{published}} the first {{studies of the}} inter-organizational network of national policy interests in Washington, D.C. These are the most exhaustive empirical studies of the social networks of national organizations to date. They demonstrate that major public policy in important domains such as health and energy are shaped by latent social connections that exist among the leaders of numerous networked organizations (e.g., lay voluntary association, federal agencies, and professional societies). Policy decisions are disproportionately shaped by organizations that have vested interests in the outcomes of domain-specific issues and those that have greater capacity to monitor events and to obtain information/resources {{by virtue of their}} positions within the interorganizational network. At the same time, organizations' positions within these networks varies by domain, such that there is no single core set of organizations that dominates resource or influence flows across different policy domains. These studies forged innovative connections between social network analysis and data-reduction and display techniques, especially multidimensional scaling, and presented some of the earliest analyses of two-mode (actor-and-event) social network data. In recognition of these and his various other contributions to the field, Laumann was chosen as the keynote speaker at the first <b>European</b> <b>social</b> networks <b>conference</b> in Groningen, Netherlands in 1989, and at the Annual Sunbelt Conference in Vancouver, Canada in 2006.|$|R

Eliot’ The Rock poem, where he states that there are value waste by not having real understanding of what to be retained from knowledge within activity and its meaning. Those challenges become more complex as we are now in a networked society. As a result of an increasing digital and highly networked context, any individual action is lasting in memory and thus can evolve into being known to some other, non-controlled, unknown context. Are we prepared for such complex, uncontrolled set for human activity? What can be the implications of such, for security issues and human relationship within an organization context? This will set the discussion to support smart use of social media for organizations that avoids Eliot’ words of wasting meaning...|$|R
40|$|The {{publication}} “Beggars, {{peasants and}} Soldiers in the Early Modern Age“ {{consists of two}} parts: 1. The papers of the “Paupers and Beggars“ section of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Science History <b>Conference</b> which took place at Gent, Belgium in April 2010, 2. South-west German sources dealing with the relations between soldiers and civilians during the Thirty Years’ War. 1. The papers of the “Paupers and Beggars“ section of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Science History <b>Conference,</b> Gent, Belgium, in April 2010 In the first paper Gerhard Fritz shows the percentage of beggars and vagrants {{of the population in}} the Swabian Kreis (i. e. South Western Germany) of the late 17 th century and the 18 th century. According to historian Carsten Küther the percentage was about 10 % or more. Fritz reduces these estimations – at least for times of peace. During peaceful times the percentage of vagrants seems to have been rather low (1 or 2 %) but during the very long times of war it could have reached 10, 20, 30 % or even more. Alfred Stefan Weiß uses a travel book dealing with the Duchy of Carinthia written by Franz Sartori around 1800 as his first main source. Sartori says that there have been “masses of beggars“ in Carinthia. Weiß shows that Sartori must have suffered from some kind of “beggar-phobia“ which led to an over-estimation of the number of Carinthian beggars during that time. Numbers of beggars too high can also be found in a source from Salzburg from 1819. Gerhard Ammerer focuses on the survival strategies of the wandering beggars in Austria and states that they survived by a combination of work and begging, legal and illegal activities. Ammerer discusses the concept of “adaptive family economy“ developed by Richard Wall and comes to the conclusion that this concept can also be applied to the unsettled population. 2. South-west German sources concerning the relations between soldiers and civilians during the Thirty Years’ War. Eberhard Fritz and Maria Würfel present facsimiles of sources, transcriptions into the German language of the 17 th century, and translations to actual German and English. By means of the edition, the transcription, and the translations pupils and students have the possibility to see and learn how historians actually work. The first text is a list of the Empirial commander Schüller von Herdern “on how citizens and peasants shall behave towards high and non commissioned officers and common cavalrymen as well as foot soldiers“. The second text contains the military “Rates of food 1640 “, the third and the fourth texts are “Reports concerning the quarterings“ in the villages of Mössingen and Talheim, and the last text is a report about “Resistance of mugged people“ against marauding soldiers near the village of Grötzingen...|$|R
