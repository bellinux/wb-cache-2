5000|$|The general {{principle}} reflects the maxim Actor sequitur forum rei, or, he who acts (the plaintiff) must follow the forum (or jurisdiction) {{of the thing}} involved (the subject of the lawsuit, meaning the defendant). This rule is presented in Article 2(1) (2012 recast: Article 4(1)) of the Regulation that ‘persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State’. The law leans in favour of the defendant, since it is “more difficult, generally speaking, to defend oneself in the courts of a foreign country than in those of another town {{in the country where}} one is domiciled”. Furthermore, Article 2(2) of the Regulation embodies the [...] "principle of equality of treatment" [...] by stating that 'persons who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules of jurisdiction applicable to nationals of that State'. Although this is the 'general' <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> of the Regulation, it only comes after the other articles in hierarchy and allows for many exceptions, making its general character rather relative; however, the latter is still reflected throughout the Regulation in the way how all exceptions to this rule must be interpreted strictly.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{approach}} of the European Union Private International Law (EU PIL) to the allocation of jurisdiction among Member States in relation to cross-border online copyright infringements. The advent of the Internet has given rise to new challenges for PIL. The cyberspace calls for clear rules aimed to determine which national court may exercise jurisdiction over a cross-border online copyright infringement. Taking the EU law response to such challenges as a case-study, the essay describes the relevant jurisdictional rules laid down in Regulation EU No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis). Secondly, the paper examines the Pinckney and Hejduk cases where the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) attempted to adapt the special forum of former Article 5 (3) of Regulation EC No 44 / 2001 (Brussels I), now Article 7 (2) of Brussels I-bis Regulation, to the peculiarities of online copyright infringements. The Author criticizes the solutions achieved by the CJEU, stressing, in particular, the risks of adopting the accessibility criterion as a general ground of jurisdiction for violations committed through the Internet. The study shows that the special <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> of locus commissi delicti is not suitable for online infringements. For the purposes of foreseeability and legal certainty, it would be desirable to shift from a CJEU's case-by-case approach to a comprehensive and coherent legislative framework. The Author concludes that {{it is time for the}} EU legislator to include in Brussels I-bis Regulation a special <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> for all types of online torts. The new provision should be inspired by the proximity principle, in order to overcome the difficulties arising from the localization of the locus delicti within the cyberspace...|$|E

The Supreme Court’s 2005 opinion in Grable 2 ̆ 6 Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering 2 ̆ 6 Manufacturing stands as a recent example. In Grable, the unanimous Court endeavored to synthesize the numerous doctrines governing jurisdiction over state-law claims raising federal questions (or “embedded” federal questions), and to resolve a circuit split over whether a federal private right of action must accompany the alleged embedded federal questions. The Court decided that jurisdiction does not, in fact, require an underlying federal right of action, but that a right of action is relevant to determinations of “substantiality” and federalism. Grable thus represents the rejection of a bright-line <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> in favor of a nuanced, discretionary one, making clear that the jurisdictional waters should remain murky. Grable’s rejection of a bright-line <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> raises broader questions about clarity’s role in federal-question jurisdiction doctrine and whether clarity in theory translates into clarity in practice. How have district courts reacted to the Supreme Court’s clarification of doctrine and choice of a flexible rule? Has the clarification offered litigants a clearer picture for predicting jurisdiction?

40|$|Jurists and {{commentators}} have repeated for centuries the refrain that jurisdictional rules should be clear. Behind this mantra {{is the idea}} that clearly designed jurisdictional rules should enable trial courts to more easily apply the law and therefore allow litigants to more accurately predict how trial courts will rule. The mantra’s ultimate goal is efficiency—that trial courts not labor too long on jurisdiction and most importantly, that litigants can accurately predict the correct forum and choose to spend their money litigating the merits of their claim, rather than where it will be heard. Jurisdictional clarity largely is devoted to sharpening litigants’ vision of the proper jurisdiction. But clarity is not costless. Bright-line jurisdictional rules have the potential to remand the desirable cases with the undesirable ones. In federal-question jurisdiction rules, for example, clarity is somewhat overvalued in theory and unachieved in practice. In theory, the constitutional and statutory bases for federal-question jurisdiction prescribe simply and broadly that jurisdiction exists over “all” actions “arising under” federal law. There exist compelling reasons to have federal courts adjudicate essential federal questions, even if those questions happen to arise through state-law claims. Therefore, many theoretically “clear” rules, like Justice Holmes’s proposal that only federal claims “arise under” federal law, would improperly trim the intent of “arising under” jurisdiction and contravene the supposed benefits of the federal forum. In theory, then, important substance and systemic benefits may be unnecessarily sacrificed on the altar of clarity. In practice, the word “clarity” seems to work much like the word “classy”—if you have to say it, it probably is not true, at least for federal- question jurisdiction. The Supreme Court’s 2005 opinion in Grable 2 ̆ 6 Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering 2 ̆ 6 Manufacturing stands as a recent example.

40|$|With the {{enduring}} doctrine of federal sovereign immunity, {{it is too}} late in the day to suggest that the United States should be treated as an ordinary party in the federal courts. Yet as the Supreme Court has become more comfortable with the increasingly common encounter with a statutory waiver of immunity, the rigidity of interpretive approach has eased. An early jaundiced judicial attitude has resolved into a greater respect for the legislative promise of relief to those harmed by their government. After sketching the history of statutory waivers over the past century-and-a-half and examining Supreme Court decisions across the decades, this Article maintains that a coherent and principled jurisprudence of federal sovereign immunity has been gradually emerging. The Court now reserves absolute jurisdictional analysis for verifying the existence of a statutory waiver for a general class of claims, while judiciously employing strict construction to preclude judicial implication of new causes of actions or remedies. By contrast, the Court is more inclined to use ordinary modes of statutory construction when examining other standards, limitations, or exceptions in statutory waivers, even presuming that procedural rules apply in government cases {{in the same manner as}} in private litigation. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision resurrected an old line of cases that translated a statute of limitations for certain claims against the United States into a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule.</b> This Article suggests that the negative effect of this decision on the course of the law, although not negligible, is limited by the decision 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on stare decisis.

40|$|Whether a {{limitation}} is jurisdictional {{or not is}} an important but often obscure question. In {{an article published in}} Northwestern University Law Review, I proposed a framework for courts to resolve the issue in a principled way, but I left open the next logical question: what does it mean if a rule is characterized as nonjurisdictional? Jurisdictional rules generally have a clearly defined set of traits: they are not subject to equitable exceptions, consent, waiver, or forfeiture; they can be raised at any time; and they can be raised by any party or the court sua sponte. This jurisdictional rigidity has led courts and commentators to overlook the fact that non jurisdictional rules need not be the mirror inverse but may instead have attributes commonly associated with jurisdictionality. A non <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> might, for example, be 2 ̆ 2 mandatory, 2 ̆ 2 meaning that it is subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if properly raised by the party for whose benefit it lies, it has the jurisdictional-like attribute of being immune to equitable exceptions. This Article is the first {{to take a hard look}} at non jurisdictional rules and, particularly, 2 ̆ 2 mandatory 2 ̆ 2 rules. It first argues that they have an important institutional role to play in our procedural system. It then shows that, in practice, mandatory but non jurisdictional characterizations may help explain a number of perplexing doctrines. As an example, the Article demonstrates how such a characterization can help reconcile the convoluted doctrine of state sovereign immunity. Ultimately, the Article suggests that a greater appreciation for mandatory rules both can benefit the procedural system and can broaden our view of what salutary roles non jurisdictional rules can play...|$|E
40|$|Congress {{created the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982, and granted that court {{exclusive}} appellate jurisdiction over civil actions arising under patent law. Congress 2 ̆ 7 s primary goals {{in creating the}} Federal Circuit were to produce a more uniform patent jurisprudence and to reduce forum shopping based on favorable patent law. But in the 2002 decision of Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, the Supreme Court held that patent counterclaims alone could not create Federal Circuit jurisdiction. This decision not only overruled the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule,</b> but also {{opened the door for}} Regional Circuit Courts of Appeals (RCCOAs) to decide appeals where patent claims appear only as counterclaims. Because RCCOAs generally do not defer to the decisions of coordinate federal courts (what can be termed the rule of no deference), RCCOAs will be able to independently develop patent caselaw - threatening the goals for which the Federal Circuit was created. To date, the scholarly response to Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s problems has focused on approaches expanding the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction. Commentators addressing deference to the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s patent precedents have either assumed that deference is impossible or impractical, or have mentioned deference as an option only in passing. No one yet has analyzed in detail the case for deference to the Federal Circuit. This article provides that analysis. It explains why the traditional justifications for the rule of no deference are inapplicable here, why deference to the Federal Circuit serves Congressional intent, and why the reasons for such deference compare favorably to established exceptions to the rule of no deference. The article also suggests a particular scope and level of deference, and explains deference 2 ̆ 7 s superiority as a long-term solution over jurisdictional modifications. The article should be particularly useful to practitioners and judges faced with these issues in the short-term, and should facilitate inquiry by legislators and academics into a long-term resolution...|$|E
40|$|This study {{starts with}} a quote by Professor Meessen: “The {{function}} of scholars of international law offers less opportunity for creative thinking [compared to scholars of conflict of laws]: they may compile and analyze state practice, but they cannot replace it with their own concepts. ”[1] This study, which primarily looks at the phenomenon of jurisdiction through a (public) international law lens, rejects that limiting claim. While {{the current state of}} the international law of jurisdiction is described at length on the basis of State practice, a consistent doctrine of jurisdiction has been developed, on the basis of both State practice and rational thinking. The exercise of jurisdiction is in practice often characterized by a sheer lack of objectivity – which is not surprising as States, when unilaterally asserting jurisdiction – will almost variably emphasize their own interests over foreign States’ interests. A doctrine that gives States almost unlimited discretion to exercise jurisdicition as they see fit – the doctrine that was seemingly coined by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the 1927 Lotus case – is not workable, because it justifies the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction and allows powerful States to outmaneuver weaker ones. It is shown that there are no hard and fast rules of public international law that limit States’ jurisdictional assertions and confer jurisdiction on the State with the strongest nexus to a situation. Nonetheless, it is also shown that there are a number of international law principles that may serve to restrain the exercise of jurisdiction when the legitimate rights of other States would be encroached upon. The principles of non-intervention, sovereign equality, equity, proportionality, and the prohibition of abuse of law, have been cited in this context. While these principles are typically used in a non-jurisdictional context, this should, given their generic nature, not exclude their application to the law of jurisdiction. In chapter 5, the use of a <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> of reason, as set forth in § 403 of the Restatement (Third) of U. S. Foreign Relations Law, is therefore advocated, pursuant to which States are entitled to exercise jurisdiction only if they do so reasonably. The <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> of reason may not be a rule de lege lata, for there is insufficient evidence that States, if they restrained their jurisdictional assertions, have done so because international law obliged them to do so. Yet, undeniably, a system of international jurisdiction is only viable if States balance their regulatory interests with the interests of other affected foreign nations, as if they were a global regulator who objectively assesses the merits of any one State’s legal and policy interests. Jurisdictional reasonableness is the main focus throughout this study, and has been applied consistently to the different fields of the law studied. In the final part of this study, the principle of jurisdictional reasonableness is given more ‘body’. For one, it is argued that reasonable jurisdiction could emerge through transnational communicative networks wiring State, international, and private actors. For another, it is shown how States, in different legal contexts, if a situation has a stronger nexus to another State, tend to apply their own laws only on a subsidiary basis. This principle of subsidiarity serves to restrain the exercise of jurisdiction by giving the State with the strongest nexus the primary right to exercise jurisdiction. If the ‘primary’ State fails to exercise jurisdiction, even if, from a global perspective, such were desirable, the ‘subsidiary’ State has the right – and, it may be argued, sometimes the duty – to step in, in the interest of the global community. Such a jurisdictional system connects sovereign interests – on which the law of jurisdiction was traditionally based – with global interests, and ensures that impunity and globally harmful underregulation do not arise. Sovereignty then becomes a “relative” concept: international law and the international interest determine when States could invoke it. [2] If, finally, States, regulators, courts and various legal practitioners are searching for one useful <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb in this study, it is this one: the State with the strongest nexus to a situation is entitled to exercise its jurisdiction, yet if it fails to adequately do so, another State with a weaker nexus (and in the case of violations of jus cogens without a nexus) may step in, provided that its exercise of jurisdiction serves the global interest.

40|$|The {{ideal of}} clear and simple <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> {{seems like a}} no-brainer. Clarity in areas of {{subject-matter}} jurisdiction generally reduces the cost of litigating those issues and thus preserves litigant and judicial resources for the merits of a dispute. As a result, scholars and justices regularly promote the rhetoric of jurisdictional clarity. Yet no one has probed that rhetoric or reconciled it {{with the reality of}} subject-matter jurisdiction doctrine, which is anything but clear and simple. This Article begins to fill that gap, and, in the process, shifts the perspective of existing conversations between rules and standards and between mandates and discretion toward a perspective that focuses on the value and attainability of clarity. It offers a more refined understanding of the surprising uncertainty and complexity of jurisdictional clarity, and it argues that, contrary to the rhetoric, the ideal of jurisdictional clarity is mostly illusory. Difficulties inherent in the design, implementation, and instrumental direction of clear and simple <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> largely render them unattainable. Rather than continue to invoke the unexamined ideal of clarity and simplicity, jurisdictional doctrine should strive to confine clarity to what it can reasonably accomplish and to embrace the undervalued virtues of uncertainty and complexity...|$|R

40|$|Part I {{introduces}} the central {{themes in the}} law of federal question jurisdiction. It describes the prevailing interpretations of the constitutional and statutory texts governing the federal courts 2 ̆ 7 jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving questions of federal law, and it explores {{the reasons for the}} establishment of such jurisdiction. This Part also {{introduces the}} well-pleaded complaint rule and examines the reasons for its adoption by the Supreme Court. Part II provides a detailed account of complete preemption doctrine, under which parties are permitted to usher state-law claims into the federal courts despite the apparent absence of any federal question {{on the face of the}} plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s well-pleaded complaint. Under the complete preemption rule, a state-law claim will fall within the federal question jurisdiction of the federal courts if it is preempted by a federal statutory scheme that provides the exclusive cause of action for the harm alleged. Part II emphasizes the apparent disconnect between this special <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rule</b> and the reasons underlying the creation of federal question jurisdiction in the first place-in particular, the need for uniformity in the interpretation of federal law. Part III answers the question of what complete preemption jurisprudence might look like were it reshaped in light of the relationship between preemption and the uniformity interest. I develop this answer by focusing on a feature of this interest that has been overlooked by courts and commentators alike. Specifically, the interest in uniformity comes in two distinct forms: 2 ̆ 2 equal-application uniformity, 2 ̆ 2 which denotes the interest in assuring that all parties subject to a particular regulatory rule are treated alike, and 2 ̆ 2 regulatory uniformity, 2 ̆ 2 which refers to the interest in subjecting regulated entities to a single rule of law when regulation by a multitude of sovereigns would be intolerable. I argue that the intensity of the interest in regulatory uniformity varies significantly among federal statutory schemes and that where this interest is implicated with unusual force, the argument for federal jurisdiction is strongest. I explain, finally, that we can discern when the interest in regulatory uniformity is in play through careful attention to how broadly preemptive a federal statutory scheme is. Accordingly, Part III makes the case that the doctrine of complete preemption would operate more sensibly if it were remodeled with an eye to the breadth of federal preemption...|$|E
40|$|INTERNET BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH AN INTERNATIONAL ELEMENT The recent {{developments}} in technology have raised new forms of electronic communication and business strategies on the Internet, in particular the direct e-commerce operated through dynamically generated websites. As a consequence, the suitability of traditional legal norms has been challenged, including the rules governing jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the aim of the thesis is to characterize the nature of the concept of directing business activities under the article 15 of the Brussels Regulation, as well as to identify the relevant criteria as to its fulfilment, all {{in the context of the}} disputes arising from the consumer contracts concluded as a result of the business activities directed towards the consumers of a member state on the Internet.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{issues raised by}} the {{emergence}} of the Internet and e-commerce for the private international law. Using the Internet to conduct business brings up new situations that must be reflected and dealt with by law. It is to be solved whether just accommodation of current rules will be enough or new regulation will have to be adopted. At first the thesis describes specific characteristics of the Internet, such as low costs of addressing users regardless of their geographic location or possibility of performing contracts in digitalized form and legal consequences of these characteristics. The following chapter deals with principles from which stems the difference in between <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in common law and civil law states. It examines <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> stated in Brussels I Regulation in relation to e-commerce, especially consumer contracts. These firm rules are aimed to secure predictability of forum and in times of the Internet they have to overcome some difficulties through autonomous definitions of European Court of Justice.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} jurisdiction and {{applicable law}} in limitation proceedings. It {{is argued that}} limitation proceedings can be categorised into, at least, three separate groups: proceedings determining the right to limit liability itself; proceedings concerning {{the establishment of the}} limitation fund; and proceedings for the release of secured assets after a limitation fund has been established. The analysis of the three limitation conventions supports such distinction and suggests that the 1996 LLMC Convention does not contain <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in respect of the first category but contains <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in respect of the establishment of the limitation fund. These rules are not uniform between Contracting States and are discretionary in character. Accordingly, we conclude that the jurisdictional arrangements contained in the international conventions are too weak and unclear to override, by virtue of Article 71, the other jurisdictional provisions of Brussels I. The law applicable to limitation of liability with respect to non-contractual obligations under the operation of the Rome II Regulation is also discussed. The English law position that the law applicable was that of the forum appears to have been changed by Rome II.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen much debate {{about the role of}} {{national}} courts in addressing global harms. That debate has focused on the application by domestic courts of international law - for instance, in civil actions brought in U. S. courts to enforce human rights law. This article identifies a parallel development in the area of economic regulation. It classifies and analyzes a category of cases that seek the application of regulatory law by domestic courts in situations involving global economic misconduct. Like the public international law cases, these cases highlight the tension between the benefits to be gained by enhanced enforcement of global substantive norms and the need to observe the jurisdictional norms that order the exercise of authority within the international community. On the one hand, traditional <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> unnecessarily foreclose valid arguments for marshaling the resources of national courts in order to improve the global welfare. On the other hand, however, those rules reflect legitimate concerns of foreign states about the exercise of power and authority within the international community. The Article seeks a resolution to that tension in the economic context. Situating transnational regulatory litigation within the broader framework of transgovernmental theory, it proposes a more functional approach to certain <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules,</b> as well as a procedural mechanism for use in cross-border class actions, that would legitimize the evolving role of national courts in implementing global regulatory strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The 1952 Arrest Convention {{was created}} in order to unify the rules {{relating}} to arrest of ships around the world. Before the Convention, the rules relating to arrest of ship were governed by the different countries national rules of law. This created problems for the shipping industry as a ship could be arrested in relation to any claim whatsoever if it was permitted by the domestic law {{of the country where}} the ship was. Also considering that many countries have exorbitant <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> and sometimes on very loose grounds claim jurisdiction, this was a problem. Shipping is a very special kind of business as it involves movable property that often has a great value and suddenly can enter jurisdictional territory and a claimant can get hold of security he could not have counted on. These exorbitant <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> made the shipping business insecure and something needed to be done about it. Therefore the Arrest Convention was created. The Convention regulates for what claims a ship can be arrested and therefore gives the claimant and the defendant an ability to foresee when there is a claim in relation to which it is possible to get an arrest. If the Convention had had the effects one wanted one would only have to know about the rules in the Convention and not about the numerous other national <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in the ports or the territorial waters that the ship may enter on its journey. However, the Convention, even though probably having made some applications of law easier, it has not been a pervading effect. Firstly, as with many international conventions the Arrest Convention has not been ratified by all countries although it has been ratified by many in comparison {{with a lot of other}} international conventions. Secondly, there are some questions on when the Convention shall apply before national rules and when it shall not. This has been especially clear in relation to the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgements. Even though the Arrest Convention prevails there is still confusion in reality when applying the Conventions. Within the EU the uncertainty becomes even greater as one has to consider both the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in the Arrest Convention, the rules in the Brussels Convention and the national rules relating to arrest. This makes the possibility to foresee what rules will govern a case even more difficult. However, these uncertainties can be used by forum shoppers that are trying to find loopholes through which to avoid one jurisdiction and get the case taken on by another, more favourable, jurisdiction. The Arrest Convention’s rules on jurisdiction can be used by a claimant to claim jurisdiction in a country where he might not have had jurisdiction if the Convention had not been in force. The same goes for the Brussels Convention. There being uncertainties in the relation between the Conventions and the Conventions and national law is a great incentive for a plaintiff or a defendant to try and stretch the rules in his favour. Sometimes the outcome of a case can be completely different from one jurisdiction to another. Forum shopping, which is the common term when choosing jurisdiction because of more favourable law rules, is used within all types of law having some kind of international connection and there are different opinions about it. The reason behind it is always to get the best outcome possible in a lawsuit, but what is the best possible outcome? In order to shop you also need to know what you are shopping for and where to find it. In international maritime law, being governed by many international conventions not always being signed by the same countries and sometimes having different application depending on if other relating conventions have been signed by the same countries, the best country in which to sue is not always obvious at a first glance. Consequently in order to make a sound decision on where to sue in order to get the most out of a lawsuit you have to look at the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>rules</b> in order to find out where you can sue and you have to look at the procedural and substantial rules in order to see where you will get the decision you are looking for...|$|R

50|$|But the NBTC {{was often}} as {{ineffective}} as local councils. Many {{national and international}} unions refused to join. The NBTC's respect for local union autonomy often meant that local unions set jurisdictional policy for national unions, a situation national unions could not accept.

Membership {{on the local level}} was also spotty, hurting local council finances and undercutting the weight of local council decisions.
