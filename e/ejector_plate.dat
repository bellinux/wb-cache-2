5000|$|The {{original}} Perfection game {{consists of}} a red and yellow board with 26 shapes. Its [...] "pop-up" [...] mechanism was an <b>ejector</b> <b>plate</b> situated under the shaped holes and lowered by a PUSH button. The board also included a scoreboard with four stackable pegs of different colors. One point was scored for each shape properly placed in their correct holes; if all 26 shapes were inserted before the allotted 60 seconds, one point was also scored for each remaining second left on the clock. For tie scores, pegs were stacked {{on top of one}} another.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{works is}} focused on design and fabrication of an automatic injection moulding tool for production of CAM BUSH which is used in electrical engines as a connector. An injection mould is a tool which is used for production of plastic components in large numbers in a short span of time. The moulding tool consists of the Top plate, Cavity plate, Core plate, Spacer blocks, <b>Ejector</b> <b>plate</b> and the Bottom plate. In this work, six core pins and six ejector pins are provided on injection mould because the required cam bush has six indexing holes. The material, Oil Hardened Non-shrinking Steel(OHNS) for the core and cavity, EN 353 for the guide pillar, guide bushes, core pins, ejector pins, locator ring and the sprue bush and Mild Steel for other plates are selected. The elements of injection moulding tool have been designed, fabricated and assembled. Submarine gate and Baffle circular hole cooling system has been provided in the moulding tool to increase the productivity and good surface finish. The required Nylon- 66 Cam bush component is produced with this moulding tool by properly controlling the various parameters of injection moulding machine...|$|E
5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an <b>ejector</b> pin <b>plate,</b> which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The <b>ejector</b> pin <b>plate</b> also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis work {{reports on a}} study of a subsonic, turbulent, diffuse discharge with potential application to electric discharge convection lasers. Two methods of turbulence generation have been investigated; namely, a pulsed-jet <b>ejector</b> and a <b>plate</b> generator. Power inputs for various flow conditions are reported. Turbulence spectra for these flow conditions have been studied and an effort made to optimize the discharge stabilizing properties of the flow. Place generated turbulence proved superior for stabilizing the discharge. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, Hot Wheels {{released}} a 1/18 die-cast of KITT {{as part of}} their die-cast Elite series of vehicles under their Cult Classics Collection. This one from Hot Wheels was an improvement over the one ERTL released back in 2004. With sharper attention to details on the dashboard, the model features an improved light up red scanner, opening doors and rear hatch, as well as an engine hood which opens up to reveal a detailed Knight 2000 turbine engine which is exclusive to the model and was never shown in the TV series. Additional features include pop up headlights, revolving license <b>plates,</b> <b>ejector</b> seats, removable t-tops and a foldable rear seat.|$|R
40|$|Optimization of hole-making {{operations}} in manufacturing industry plays a vital role. Tool travel and tool switch planning {{are the two}} major issues in hole-making operations. Many industrial applications such as moulds, dies, engine block, automotive parts etc. requires machining of large number of holes. Large number of machining operations like drilling, enlargement or tapping/reaming are required to achieve the final size of individual hole, which gives rise to number of possible sequences to complete hole-making operations on the part depending upon the location of hole and tool sequence to be followed. It is necessary to find the optimal sequence of operations which minimizes the total processing cost of hole-making operations. In this work, therefore an attempt is made to reduce the total processing cost of hole-making operations by applying relatively new optimization algorithms known as shuffled frog leaping algorithm and proposed modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm for the determination of optimal sequence of hole-making operations. An industrial application example of <b>ejector</b> <b>plate</b> of injection mould is considered in this work to demonstrate the proposed approach. The obtained results by the shuffled frog leaping algorithm and proposed modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm are compared with each other. It is seen from the obtained results {{that the results of}} proposed modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm are superior to those obtained using shuffled frog leaping algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to measure the ball recovery rate of cleaning apparatus for plate heat exchanger. Ceramic ball is used for plate heat exchanger cleaning. The main components of cleaning apparatus are comprised of ball collector, ball trap, <b>ejector,</b> pump and <b>plate</b> heat exchanger. The ball recovery rate are obtained with change in recovery time and velocity of water. The results show that the ball recovery rate is slightly increased with increase in the recovery time and the velocity of water over 0. 4 m/s in the straight flow. In the case of reverse flow, the ball recovery rate more increased than straight flow. The maximum ball recovery rate of the straight flow and reverse flow reach 83. 97 % an...|$|R
500|$|The mould {{consists}} of two primary components, the injection mould (A <b>plate)</b> and the <b>ejector</b> mould (B <b>plate).</b> These components are {{also referred to as}} moulder and mouldmaker. Plastic resin enters the mould through a sprue or gate in the injection mould; the sprue bushing is to seal tightly against the nozzle of the injection barrel of the moulding machine and to allow molten plastic to flow from the barrel into the mould, also known as the [...] The sprue bushing directs the molten plastic to the cavity images through channels that are machined into the faces of the A and B plates. These channels allow plastic to run along them, so they are referred to as runners. [...] The molten plastic flows through the runner and enters one or more specialised gates and into the cavity geometry to form the desired part.|$|R
