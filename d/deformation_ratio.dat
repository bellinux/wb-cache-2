50|$|Torza’s 1971 {{solution}} for droplet deformation under {{the presence of}} a uniform, time-varying electric field is the most widely reference model for predicting small amplitude droplet deformations. Similar to the solution developed by Taylor, Torza developed a {{solution for}} electrodynamic droplet deformation by considering fluid circulation both inside and outside of a droplet interface. His solution is innovative because it derives an expression for the instantaneous droplet <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> by considering separate sub-problems to derive the effects of electric stress, internal hydrodynamic stress, external hydrodynamic stress, and the surface tension on the droplet interface. The droplet <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> D is a quantity that expresses the relative extension and shortening of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of a sphere.|$|E

The {{results indicate that the}} tensile strength, yield strength and impact energy were raised 241 MPa, 180 MPa and 10. 0 J respectively, at a higher <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio.</b> While, the average original austenite grain size was refined from 14. 93 µm to 9. 57 µm when the <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> was increased from 0. 65 to 0. 83 as well as the martensite lath width thinned from 400 nm to 250 nm. Furthermore, at various deformation ratios, the precipitates morphology was different in quantity, grain size and dispersion. There are more eutectic precipitates and secondary precipitates dispersed along the grain boundary as continuous chains with lower <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio.</b> On the contrary, the precipitates in specimen with higher <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> were uniform and fine without chain or network.

There was a close correlation between the mechanical characteristics and the non-ideal storage time. Sensory evaluation showed significant ranking in “bite and chewing”, “sweet taste” and “global impression” attributes according to the Page test. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were determined for the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force and <b>deformation</b> work <b>ratio</b> and these showed that PC 1 followed a tendency {{similar to that of}} the storage time. PCA plots were determined for the electronic tongue measurements and this PCA separated the sample groups along PC 1 and PC 2. We used partial least square (PLS) regression to predict “bite and chewing” from the acoustic stiffness coefficient, cutting force, and <b>deformation</b> work <b>ratio</b> with an acceptable correlation. The “sweet taste” was predicted from the electronic tongue measurement results with good correlation.

40|$|In this research, {{the maximum}} <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{water-based}} paint droplets impacting and spreading onto a flat solid surface was investigated numerically {{based on the}} Navier–Stokes equation coupled with the level set method. The effects of droplet size, impact velocity, and equilibrium contact angle are taken into account. The maximum <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> increases as droplet size and impact velocity increase, and can scale as We 1 / 4, where We is the Weber number, for {{the case of the}} effect of the droplet size. Finally, the effect of equilibrium contact angle is investigated, and the result shows that spreading radius decreases with the increase in equilibrium contact angle, whereas the height increases. When the dimensionless time t* < 0. 3, there is a linear relationship between the dimensionless spreading radius and the dimensionless time to the 1 / 2 power. For the case of 80 ° ≤ θe ≤ 120 °, where θe is the equilibrium contact angle, the simulation result of the maximum <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> follows the fitting result.

40|$|In essence, the {{accuracy}} in maximum inelastic deformation estimates {{is the main}} concern for simplified nonlinear analysis procedures. The issue is more important for near-fault ground motions due to their high deformation demands on structures. The complex seismological features of these ground motions need to be mapped correctly on the proposed procedure to capture the most realistic demand variation on structural systems. This paper {{presents the results of}} a statistical study that describes the relation between the maximum inelastic and elastic deformation demands of near-fault ground motions on structural systems that do not experience strength deterioration. A total number of 145 near-fault ground motions recorded on firm-to-dense soil sites are used to investigate the variation of maximum inelastic to elastic <b>deformation</b> <b>ratios</b> for single-degree-of-freedom systems. The near-fault ground motion data set is evaluated in detail to distinguish records that contain pulse-like signal effects. The median variation of maximum inelastic to elastic <b>deformation</b> <b>ratios</b> is described separately for near-fault records that either do or do not contain pulse signals. The observations from these computations indicate that the existing pulse signal affects the inelastic deformation demand significantly and a categorization in near-fault ground motions in terms of signals with- and without-pulse is necessary for an accurate estimation of maximum inelastic deformation demand. The median error statistics for FEMA- 356 nonlinear analysis procedure are presented that lacks such a categorization in near-fault deformation demand...|$|R

A simplified version of the MPA has been proposed based on the concept of the inelastic <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, the effect of the higher modes of vibration is considered by assuming linearly-elastic responses, which enables the use of standard elastic response spectrum analysis. In this thesis, the simplified MPA (SMPA) method is applied to determine the target global drift and the inter-story drifts of steel frame building. The effect of the higher vibration modes is considered {{within the framework of the}} SMPA. A comprehensive survey about the inelastic <b>deformation</b> <b>ratio</b> is presented.

40|$|International audienceTransmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) {{has been used}} to investigate the effect of laponite clay on microdeformation in thin latex-based polystyrene (PS) films, in which the laponite was concentrated at the original interfaces between the PS particles. At room temperature, a transition was observed from crazing in pure PS to a coarser fibrillar deformation mode as the laponite content increased. Moreover, whereas pure PS showed increasingly homogeneous deformation as T approached T(g), the fibrillar deformation zones observed in the nanocomposites persisted up to T just below T(g), and there was some evidence for yielding behaviour at even higher T in the presence of laponite. The macroscopic fracture resistance of the films, as assessed from double edge-notched tensile specimens. initially increased with laponite content, but decreased for laponite contents greater than 5 wt% with respect to the styrene monomer. This was attributed to a decrease in local ductility, consistent with the observation of reduced <b>deformation</b> <b>ratios</b> in the <b>deformation</b> zones by TEM, and to the intrinsic weakness of the laponite stacks and/or the PS-laponite interface.

Owing to {{the assumption of}} infinitesimal deformation of the indentation, the finite deformation effect of indentation on the calculated material parameters was not fully understood in the double indentation approach. However, indentation tests with infinitesimal deformation are not practical for the measurement of real tissues. Accordingly, finite element models were developed to simulate the indentation with different indentor diameters and different <b>deformation</b> <b>ratios</b> to investigate the finite deformation effect of indentation.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the deformation change on the location and number of cells during water adsorption was examined by microscopy combined with a “charged-coupled device” camera and image analysis based on the digital image correlation method. The <b>deformation</b> change <b>ratio</b> (DCR) vs. moisture content (MC) in the radial direction approached linearity with MC with increasing in number of cells between measurement points in earlywood, whereas its relation in latewood was various such as swelling, swelling after shrinking, or remaining constant with MC. The number of cells between observation points clearly affected the DCR vs. MC, i. e., its relationship had the so-called “scale effect” that a certain physical property appears clearly with increasing scale. The mechanism of the scale effect differed in the radial and tangential directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} cold backward extrusion processes of square and rectangular boxes from a low-carbon steel and plastic aluminum {{was carried out}} by a finite element method. Dependences of deforming force on displacement of the warping instrument, distribution of intensity to the puncheon, a matrix, an ejector are defined. The final geometry of the details, the mode of <b>deformation,</b> strengthening and <b>ratio</b> of metal plasticity resource after deformation were determined. By results of calculation the manufacturing method of box is developed. ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ??????? ?? ???????????????? ????? ? ??????????? ????????. ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????????? ?? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????, ????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ????????, ???????, ?????????????. ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????, ??????????-??????????????? ?????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ??????????. ?? ????????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????...|$|R
40|$|The Sneinton Formation {{occurs at}} the base of the Mercia Mudstone Group and {{consists}} of sandstones with interbedded siltstones and mudstones. The sample material was obtained from core from a 63 m deep borehole sunk near Epperstone some 10 km north of Nottingham. The petrographic character-istics, namely quartz content, clay size content, packing density and particle size distribution of the sandstones, were deter-mined for a series of depths. In addition, the density, porosity, compressive and indirect ensile strengths, ardness, modulus of <b>deformation,</b> Poisson's <b>ratio</b> and slake durability index were determined for the same depth intervals. The petrographic characteristics then were correlated with the physical and mechanical properties and the significance of the relationships assessed by Student's t value. The individual physical and mechanical properties also were the correlated with each other and the significance of the relationships similarly assessed...|$|R
