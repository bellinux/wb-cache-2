25|$|Cantonese merchants (Jyutping: Jyut6 soeng1; Traditional Chinese: 粵商) are merchants of Cantonese origins. In {{the past}} two {{thousands}} years, Lingnan (especially the area around Gwongzau) <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the time being the Chinese Empire's main port, resulting in a strong commercial tradition, formation of renowned Cantonese trade {{organizations such as the}} Canton Factories, and even Cantonese developing their own business culture: Cantonese merchants are known for being pragmatic, preference for actual profits over fame, and avoidance of political matters and display of wealth. Nowadays, Cantonese people still inherit this commercial culture. Major Lingnan cities such as Gwongzau, Futsan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong are regional (if not international) commercial centers. Hong Kong, for instance, scored 748 in 2016's Global Financial Centres Index, ranking fourth in the world and just below London and New York city.|$|E
