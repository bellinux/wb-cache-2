5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E

2500|$|A mode {{known as}} Zen mode allows players to seek high scores without the {{hindrance}} of bombs {{appearing on the}} screen, but players only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and thirty seconds. [...] Also available is an Arcade mode in which players have only sixty seconds to achieve a high score. [...] Special bananas {{are added to the}} standard fruit which have unique bonuses such as doubling points scored for a limited time, increasing the amount of fruit on the screen, or slowing down the movement of all fruit {{for a short period of}} time. There are also bombs that deduct 10 points from the player's score. In Classic and Arcade mode, special pomegranates are occasionally thrown on screen. In Arcade Mode, it is guaranteed that at the end of each game that a pomegranate will appear. Players can slice these multiple times to get extra points. Similarly, an ultra rare dragonfruit sometimes appears in Classic mode which, if sliced, awards players fifty points.|$|E
2500|$|On the façade is a chiming clock, {{with figures}} of giants, perhaps {{representing}} Gog and Magog, who strike the bells with their clubs. [...] It was {{installed on the}} previous church in 1671, perhaps commissioned to celebrate its escape from destruction by the Great Fire of 1666. [...] It was the first public clock in London to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> hand. The figures of the two giants strike the hours and quarters, and turn their heads. [...] There are numerous literary references to the clock, including in Thomas Hughes' Tom Brown's Schooldays, Oliver Goldsmith’s The Vicar of Wakefield, both David Copperfield and Barnaby Rudge by Charles Dickens, The Warden by Anthony Trollope, David Lyddal's The Prompter (1810) and a poem by William Cowper. [...] In 1828, when the medieval church was demolished, the clock was removed by art collector Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford to his mansion in Regent's Park; during World War I, a new charity for blinded soldiers was lent the house, and took the name St Dunstan's from the clock. It was returned by Lord Rothermere in 1935 to mark the Silver Jubilee of King George V.|$|E

60|$|After some {{irrelevant}} adventures, much in {{the manner}} of Gil Blas, and which occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that, being ill during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together with a negro servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase the chances of obtaining food, the two separate, and live as far apart as possible. This brings about a training of birds, to serve the purpose of carrier-pigeons between them. By and by these are taught to carry parcels of some weight-and this weight is gradually increased. At length the idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the birds, with a view to raising the author himself. A machine is contrived for the purpose, and we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> description of it, which is materially helped out by a steel engraving. Here we perceive the Signor Gonzales, with point ruffles and a huge periwig, seated astride something which resembles very closely a broomstick, and borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans (ganzas) who had strings reaching from their tails to the machine.|$|E
