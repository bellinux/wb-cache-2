Beside PVB, important thermoplastic glass lamination materials today are ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), thermoset EVA ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The adhesion of PVB/TPU and EVA is not only high to glass, but also to polyester (PE) interlayers.

50|$|<b>Electroconductive</b> gels play an {{important}} role in the success of erotic electrostimulation since without it, there is a greater risk of high-current skin burning. Water-based lubricants are generally recommended. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains silicone since it is an insulator and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of electrostimulation select lubricants for compatibility with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not <b>electroconductive.</b> Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing rings and centre clamps. This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|E

However, by using the coating method (through depositing layers), high performance textile threads are made <b>electroconductive</b> without losing their other properties. Furthermore, using coated instead of a solid metal fibre is more cost-effective especially if the desired metal is expensive such as gold, platinum or silver because the required amount of metal is considerably less.

40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} signals {{observed in}} donor-doped CaTiO 3 single crystals (Ca 12 xYxTiO 3 or CaTi 12 xNbxO 3) were analyzed {{and the results}} were discussed from a viewpoint of carrier generation. Several types of signals were observed in insulating samples, and they were tentatively assigned to some acceptors such as Al impurity and the defects relating oxygen excess. Two types of signals with sharp and broad features, both of which are assignable to electron-trapped-type centers, were observed in conductive samples. The origins of the sharp and broad signals were attributed to electrons tightly trapped on Ti 41 ions and electrons loosely localized around donors, respectively, from analysis of angular and temperature dependence of the signals. The concentrations of the centers for the sharp and broad signals were estimated at; 3 K to be; 331018 cm 23 in the H 2 -reduced samples with x 51024 and; 331019 cm 23 in the as-prepared samples with x 51022, respectively. Although no obvious correlation between <b>electroconductive</b> behavior and signal intensity was observed for the sharp signals, intensities of the broad signal increased as the <b>electroconductive</b> behavior turned from metallic to semiconducting below; 25 K. Therefore, {{it was found that the}} electrons responsible for the broad signals convert into conduction electrons when they are thermally released at high temperatures, and their concentration is high enough to influence the <b>electroconductive</b> behavior...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis {{of a novel}} <b>electroconductive</b> {{membrane}} (ECM) was {{studied with}} the aim of producing an <b>electroconductive</b> membrane (ECM) with low electrical resistance and appropriate mechanical properties. The method was based on copolymerization of a highly <b>electroconductive</b> monomer (hydroxymethyl- 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) with highly mechanical resistant hydrophilized polyamide 46 (polytetramethylene-N-hydroxyethyl adipamide). Due to the lack of hydroxyl groups, polyamide 46 does not have the tendency to take part in any chemical reactions, therefore prior to copolymerization, PA 46 was hydrophilized with acetaldehyde to create reactive sites, which allowed copolymerization to occur. At the final stage, a very thin layer, 566 nm conductive poly(hydroxymethyl- 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) homopolymer was localised using in situ plasma polymerization in order to improve the electrical conductivity of the obtained copolymer. The result was an adherent, highly conductive, semi-hydrophilic and flexible ECM. The presence of hydroxyl groups in the final product led to improved hydrophilicity of the conductive membrane with a surface tension of 41 mJ m(- 2). The electrical resistance of PA 46 was dramatically reduced after copolymerization, to 202 in dry and 54 k Omega cm(- 2) in wet conditions; furthermore, after plasma treatment, this reduction continued to 105 in dry and 2 k Omega cm(- 2) in wet conditions. Other parameters such as flux flow, roughness, pore size, pore distribution, contact angle, surface energy and thermal stability of the ECM were also investigated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{oxidation}} on the microstructural modification, electrical resistivity and mechanical strength of an AlN-SiC-MoSi 2 <b>electroconductive</b> ceramic composite were studied. After oxidation at temperatures below 1000 °C samples lose weight {{due to the}} evaporation of MoO 3, formed by the oxidation of MoSi 2. However, the AlN/SiC matrix disables the “pesting” phenomenon and strength degradation, {{despite the fact that}} at these temperatures MoSi 2 oxidizes rapidly. At temperatures above 1000 °C the composite gains weight due to the formation of a protective mullite layer on the surface, this provides good oxidation resistance for applications at high temperatures. The strength behaviour indicates the suitability of this <b>electroconductive</b> structural ceramic for applications at temperatures in the range of 1000 – 1400 °C, without any strength degradation. On the other hand, the oxidizing environment leads to a significant decrease in the electrical conductivity of the composite due to surface modification...|$|E
