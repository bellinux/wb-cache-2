But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially radiocontrast agents are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m2. Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.|$|E

These materials are classified as dangerous, {{and have to be}} collected and disposed based on special rules. Materials & Methods: In the present study we aimed to evaluate the quality of management of <b>hospital</b> <b>wastes</b> and to estimate the waste constituents in Yasuj hospitals. Density, constituents, methods of collecting, transportation and disposal of <b>hospital</b> <b>wastes</b> were evaluated in 3 consecutive days of every months of the year 2006. Results: Study showed that the daily production of solid wastes was 5. 5 Kg per hospital bed and infected solid wastes were estimated to be 1. 5 Kg per hospital bed. The total solid waste production was 1350 Kg per day which included 27. 2 percent as infected solid wastes. Solid waste density was 160. 7 Kg per cubic meter and its constituents were food wastes (19. 753 %), rubber (47. 02 %), paper (12. 05 %), glass (5. 211 %), metals (3. 41 %) and bandages, gases, clothes, etc (12. 556 %). Conclusion: The findings suggest that the solid waste management of the studied hospitals is not satisfying and more attention must be paid to the critical issues, such as plans for reducing solid wastes, isolating infected solid wastes at the production site and using safe and updated methods of disposal of solid wastes...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Hospitals {{and health-care}} centers {{are the major}} sources of {{hazardous}} <b>waste</b> generation. <b>Hospital</b> <b>wastes</b> should be collected and disposed under certain conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>hospitals</b> <b>waste</b> generation in Gorgan, Iran. Materials and methods: The study was performed in 8 hospitals including 3 educational hospitals and 5 non-educational hospitals in Gorgan, 2014. Waste generation was investigated in 4 consecutive months, three times a week. Weighting was performed 384 times (48 times in each hospital). Mann-Whitney and nonparametric correlation test were used for data analysis. Results: The results showed 40. 27 hazardous and 59. 73 general wastes were generated in hospitals. The mean rates of waste general and hazardous generation were 2. 63 and 1. 03 kg/bed/day, respectively. These rates in educational and non-educational hospitals were 3. 75 and 1. 96 kg/bed/day, respectively. Conclusion: Generation of hazardous waste was found to be high in Gorgan hospitals. Also, the educational <b>hospitals</b> generated more <b>waste</b> than non-educational <b>hospitals.</b> Therefore, necessary measures should be taken to reduce the generation of waste, especially hazardous waste. © 2015, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.
