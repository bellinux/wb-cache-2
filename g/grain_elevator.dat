5|$|The port's modern name did {{not come}} into {{widespread}} use until 1925; the current port was constructed in 1932 under the governorship of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. It included the largest <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> {{in the world at}} the time. Today the <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> is the largest in the United States east of the Mississippi River; the port has the tallest harbor crane in the state of New York.|$|E

5000|$|Thunder Bay is {{well known}} for its many <b>grain</b> <b>elevators,</b> dubbed [...] "Castles of Commerce", on its waterfront. Thunder Bay is the second largest grain port in Canada, making it an {{important}} part of Canadian grain exports. Sixteen <b>grain</b> <b>elevators</b> are located on the waterfront, however only nine are currently operational. The nine <b>grain</b> <b>elevators</b> have a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes and are capable of handing wheat, durum, coarse grains, oilseeds, feed grains, peas and crops as well as various grain by-products.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo had {{emerged as one}} of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.|$|E

A timber boom was demolished during the hurricane, leaving wood and debris on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E

5|$|Within {{five years}} Trafford Park, Europe's largest {{industrial}} estate, {{was home to}} forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe's largest <b>grain</b> <b>elevator.</b> The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant {{additional}} crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first business day of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm. Although Howe remained a wealthy man, his business prospects were few, {{and he decided to}} seek another line of work.|$|E

5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the <b>grain</b> <b>elevator</b> nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|When the Illinois and Michigan Canal {{opened in}} 1848, the landmass at Wolf Point was {{decreased}} by dredging {{to accommodate a}} turning basin for ships. In the autumn {{of the same year}} the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago's first railroad depot at Wolf Point, on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets. By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard; the Fulton Elevator, one of Chicago's earliest grain elevators, was built just {{to the north of the}} former tavern in 1852. Several blocks to the west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15, 1859. The Fulton Elevator survived this, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but was burned down on September 7, 1873. It was rebuilt in the same year, and another <b>grain</b> <b>elevator,</b> the St Paul Elevator, was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $400,000 ($ million today), but demolished them in 1906. Currently, the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street.|$|E
