Environmental pollution and uncertainty in cost of petroleum products are the principal driving forces for this movement. The major pollutants from an Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>system</b> are <b>NOx,</b> Smoke, particulate matter, Soot. Several alternative fuels were tried but all of them are carbon based fuels, therefore net carbon based pollutants cannot be reduced. One alternative to carbon-based fuels is hydrogen. Hydrogen a non-carbon fuel only can meet zero emission vehicles standards in future. Hydrogen can be commercially used as a fuel even though it is having a number of technical and economical barriers. Numerous techniques are available for use in C. I. engine such as dual fuel made, by using spark plug, glow plug, DEE as an ignition enhancer. Hydrogen was used in a diesel engine in the dual fuel mode-using diesel as an ignition source in neat form using DEE. In neat form the DEE was introduced in the manifold. In order to have a precise control of hydrogen flow and to avoid the backfire and pre – ignition problems hydrogen was injection in to intake manifold; DEE injection follows the hydrogen injection. DEE mixed with air and flows into the combustion chamber as DEE auto ignites first followed by hydrogen combustion. A single cylinder-four stroke water-cooled naturally aspirated constant speed D.

40|$|Use {{of biomass}} wastes as fuels in {{existing}} boilers would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, SO 2 and NOx emissions, while beneficially utilizing wastes. However, {{the use of}} biomass has been limited by its low energy content and density, high moisture content, inconsistent configuration and decay characteristics. If biomass is upgraded by conventional methods, {{the cost of the}} fuel becomes prohibitive. Altex has identified a process, called the Altex Fuel Pellet (AFP) process, that utilizes a mixture of biomass wastes, including municipal biosolids, and some coal fines, to produce a strong, high energy content, good burning and weather resistant fuel pellet, that is lower in cost than coal. This cost benefit is primarily derived from fees that are collected for accepting municipal biosolids. Besides low cost, the process is also flexible and can incorporate several biomass materials of interest The work reported on herein showed the technical and economic feasibility of the AFP process. Low-cost sawdust wood waste and light fractions of municipal wastes were selected as key biomass wastes to be combined with biosolids and coal fines to produce AFP pellets. The process combines steps of dewatering, pellet extrusion, drying and weatherizing. Prior to pilot-scale tests, bench-scale test equipment was used to produce limited quantities of pellets for characterization. These tests showed which pellet formulations had a high potential. Pilot-scale tests then showed that extremely robust pellets could be produced that have high energy content, good density and adequate weatherability. It was concluded that these pellets could be handled, stored and transported using equipment similar to that used for coal. Tests showed that AFP pellets have a high combustion rate when burned in a stoker type <b>systems.</b> While <b>NOx</b> emissions under stoker type firing conditions was high, a simple air staging approach reduced emissions to below that for coal. In pulverized-fuel-fired tests {{it was found that the}} ground pellets could be used as an effective <b>NOx</b> <b>control</b> agent for pulverized-coal-fired <b>systems.</b> <b>NOx</b> emissions reductions up to 63 % were recorded, when using AFP as a <b>NOx</b> <b>control</b> agent. In addition to performance benefits, economic analyses showed the good economic benefits of AFP fuel. Using equipment manufacturer inputs, and reasonable values for biomass, biosolids and coal fines costs, it was determined that an AFP plant would have good profitability. For cases where biosolids contents were in the range of 50 %, the after tax Internal Rates of Return were in the range of 40 % to 50 %. These are very attractive returns. Besides the baseline analysis for the various AFP formulations tested at pilot scale, sensitivity analysis showed the impact of important parameters on return. From results, it was clear that returns are excellent for a range of parameters that could be expected in practice. Importantly, these good returns are achieved even without incentives related to the emissions control benefits of biomass...|$|R

Oxygen enrichment for the concentration of CO 2 in the flue gas has been observed in this work to have benefits for <b>NOx</b> emission <b>control.</b> This paper presents new information {{on the effect of}} combining biomass co-firing with SNCR under various oxygen enriched and air-staging conditions performed in the 20 kW combustion facility. Biomass has a higher tendency to generate CO and produced better reductions in NO x emission with and without using SNCR. NO reduction of around 80 % were attained using SNCR for 15 % and 50 % blending ratios of biomasses at 21 % overall O 2 concentration for unstaged combustion. Whereas, a range of 40 - 80 % NO reductions were attained for coal (Russian Coal) and 15 % co-fired biomasses with 3. 1 - 5. 5 % overall O 2 concentration at 22 - 31 % levels of flame staging. Moreover, it was found that better NOx removal efficiency was attained for higher NOx emission baselines under both oxygen enriched and normal firing conditions. However, SNCR <b>NOx</b> <b>control</b> for both coal or coal-biomass blends was observed to produce higher NOx reductions during O 2 enrichment, believed to be due to the self-sustained NOx reduction reactions.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a novel <b>NOx</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{that has the}} potential to drastically reduce cost, and enhance performance, operation and safety of power plant <b>NOx</b> <b>control.</b> The new <b>system</b> optimizes the burner and the furnace to achieve very low NOx levels and to provide an adequate amount of CO, and uses the CO for reducing NO both in-furnace and over a downstream AFSCR (ammonia-free selective catalytic reduction) reactor. The AF-SCR combines the advantages of the highly successful SCR technology for power plants and the TWC (three-way catalytic converter) widely used on automobiles. Like the SCR, it works in oxidizing environment of combustion flue gas and uses only base metal catalysts. Like the TWC, the AF-SCR removes NO and excess CO simultaneously without using any external reagent, such as ammonia. This new process has been studied in a development program jointed funded by the US Department of Energy and Foster Wheeler. The report outlines the experimental catalyst work performed on a bench-scale reactor, including test procedure, operating conditions, and results of various catalyst formulations. Several candidate catalysts, prepared with readily available transition metal oxides and common substrate materials, have shown over 80 - 90 % removal for both NO and CO in oxidizing gas mixtures and at elevated temperatures. A detailed combustion study of a 400 MWe coal-fired boiler, applying computational fluid dynamics techniques to model boiler and burner design, has been carried out to investigate ways to optimize the combustion process for the lowest NOx formation and optimum CO/NO ratios. Results of this boiler and burner optimization work are reported.

In this program CONSOL is determining mercury speciation and removal at 10 coal-fired facilities. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effect of SCR on mercury capture in the ESP-FGD and SDA-FF combinations at coal-fired power plants, (2) evaluate the effect of catalyst degradation on mercury capture; (3) evaluate the effect of low load operation on mercury capture in an SCR-FGD system, and (4) collect data that could provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on Hg speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for Hg capture. This document, the second in a series of topical reports, describes the results and analysis of mercury sampling performed on a 330 MW unit burning a bituminous coal containing 1. 0 % sulfur. The unit is equipped with a SCR <b>system</b> for <b>NOx</b> <b>control</b> and a spray dryer absorber for SO{sub 2 } control followed by a baghouse unit for particulate emissions control. Four sampling tests were performed in March 2003. Flue gas mercury speciation and concentrations were determined at the SCR inlet, air heater outlet (ESP inlet), and at the stack (FGD outlet) using the Ontario Hydro method. Process stream samples for a mercury balance were collected to coincide with the flue gas measurements. Due to mechanical problems with the boiler feed water pumps, the actual gross output was between 195 and 221 MW during the tests. The results showed that the SCR/air heater combination oxidized nearly 95 % of the elemental mercury. Mercury removal, on a coal-to-stack basis, was 87 %. The mercury material balance closures for the four tests conducted at the plant ranged from 89 % to 114 %, with an average of 100 %. These results appear to show that the SCR had a positive effect on mercury removal. In earlier programs, CONSOL sampled mercury at six plants with wet FGDs for SO{sub 2 } control without SCR catalysts. At those plants, an average of 61 {+-} 15 % of the mercury was in the oxidized form at the air heater outlet. The principal purpose of this work is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} potential Hg removal ''co-benefits'' achieved by NOx, and SO{sub 2 } control technologies.
