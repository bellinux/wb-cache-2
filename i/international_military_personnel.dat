50|$|A shuffle in the {{military}} department’s administration had a rather {{negative effect on the}} process of military development. From 1991 till 1996, three Ministers of Defence and four Chiefs of General Staff were changed. About 70% of administrative staff was changed {{in the early stages of}} forming the Armed Forces of Ukraine. All military district commanders, army commanders, corps and division commanders were changed several times over. This problem was complicated by the countries instability, connected with <b>international</b> dislocation of <b>military</b> <b>personnel.</b> About 12000 officers pledged their allegiance to other countries (Mostly Russia) and more than 33000 personnel came back to serve the Ukrainian army between 1991 till 1994.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Australian Defence Force (ADF) Mental Health Prevalence and Wellbeing Study (MHPWS) is {{the first}} study of mental {{disorder}} prevalence in an entire military population. OBJECTIVE: The MHPWS aims to establish mental disorder prevalence, refine current ADF mental health screening methods, and identify specific occupational factors that influence mental health. This paper describes the design, sampling strategies, and methodology used in this study. METHOD: At Phase 1, approximately half of all regular Navy, Army, and Air Force personnel (n= 24, 481) completed self-report questionnaires. At Phase 2, a stratified sub-sample (n= 1, 798) completed a structured diagnostic interview to detect mental disorder. Based on data from non-responders, data were weighted to represent the entire ADF population (n= 50, 049). RESULTS: One in five ADF members met criteria for a 12 -month mental disorder (22 %). The most common disorder category was anxiety disorders (14. 8 %), followed by affective (9. 5 %) and alcohol disorders (5. 2 %). At risk ADF sub-groups were Army personnel, {{and those in the}} lower ranks. Deployment status did not have an impact on mental disorder rates. CONCLUSION: This study has important implications for mental health service delivery for Australian and <b>international</b> <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> as well as contemporary veterans.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, women {{have come to}} play an {{increasingly}} import-ant part in western armed forces. An <b>international</b> change in <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> policies has been variously attributed to the downsizing of the military {{following the end of}} the Cold War; a demographic trough; demands in the parent society for the extension of gender equality; the example of the wider participation of women in the national labour force; the shift away from male conscription to the recruitment of an integrated all-volunteer force (AVF); shortages of male recruits; and legal restrictions on the exclusion of women. Even so, the absolute number of military women in the West con-tinues to be small. Quantitatively, they continue to be underrepresented in armed forces in comparison with their relative numbers in society. Rarely does the proportion of women in the military approach 15 percent (US 14. 0 percent; New Zealand 14. 5 percent), let alone exceed this (Australia 16. 8 percent). The position in a selection of western armed forces is given in Table 1. For comparison, the percentage of women in the 18 – 32 age range, from which <b>military</b> <b>personnel</b> tend to be drawn, is also given. There is still some way to go before women represent approximately half of the military popu-lation, which is the proportion they usually represent in the population at large.
