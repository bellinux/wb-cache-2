5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different <b>fields.</b> <b>For</b> example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Allied {{contact with}} Rommelspargel in Normandy was by British {{airborne}} forces. During Operation Tonga, the British airborne invasion of Normandy, Airspeed Horsa gliders landed among the wooden poles and suffered casualties. Some gliders were wrecked near Sainte-Mère-Église where Americans parachutists had also landed. Where encountered, British forces {{blew up the}} logs with dynamite and cleared landing <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|The {{heliosphere}} {{and planetary}} magnetic <b>fields</b> (<b>for</b> those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in {{the interstellar medium}} {{and the strength of}} the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|While {{the campus}} has {{separate}} sports <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and badminton, {{most of the}} hostels have their own table tennis and badminton courts. A fitness and recreation centre (Umang) {{was set up in}} 2010, which houses a gymnasium, swimming pool, squash, and billiards. The multipurpose utility hall (Samanjasya) hosts most of the cultural activities on the campus.|$|E

5|$|A land {{of green}} <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial <b>fields.</b> <b>For</b> example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the park}} was sparsely used for sports. In 1899, there were 10, 7, and 5 permits issued for lawn tennis, baseball, and football, respectively. The Parade Ground was {{converted}} to recreational use starting in 1902, when the National Guard added <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> polo. In 1907, due to overcrowding, Dr. William Hornaday transferred 15 of the Bronx Zoo's then-rare bison to the Parade Ground, where they stayed until they were shipped to prairie land in Oklahoma later that year.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interband}} Landau-Zener tunneling of a quantum particle in the Hall configuration, i. e., {{in the presence}} of normal to the lattice plane gauge <b>field</b> (<b>for</b> example, magnetic <b>field</b> <b>for</b> a charged particle) and in-plane potential <b>field</b> (electric <b>field</b> <b>for</b> a charged particle). The interband tunneling is induced by the potential <b>field</b> and <b>for</b> vanishing gauge <b>field</b> is described by the common Landau-Zener theory. We generalize this theory <b>for</b> non-zero gauge <b>field.</b> The depletion rates of low-energy bands are calculated by using semi-analytical method of the truncated Floquet matrix.

5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Alexandria County (renamed Arlington County in 1920), the closest Virginia county to Washington, D.C., was a predominantly rural area. Originally part of the District of Columbia, the land now comprising the county was retroceded to Virginia in a July 9, 1846 act of Congress that took effect in 1847. Most of the county is hilly, and at the time, most of the county's population was concentrated in the city of Alexandria, at the far southeastern corner of the county. In 1861, the rest of the county largely consisted of scattered farms, the occasional house, <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> grazing livestock, and Arlington House, owned by Mary Custis, wife of Robert E. Lee.|$|E
5|$|Dosanjh and {{his wife}} Raminder have three sons. In April 2000, his middle son, Aseem, was charged with assaulting an Ontario police officer during a bar brawl, but was found not guilty. Dosanjh has {{travelled}} back to India several times, on official state business and for personal reasons, since emigrating. In January 2003, {{he was awarded the}} Pravasi Bharatiya Samman (Expatriate Indian Honour) from Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi. The award recognises individual excellence in various <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> persons of Indian origin across the world.|$|E
5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite {{different from those of}} atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric <b>fields.</b> <b>For</b> example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} weak {{interband}} pair-transfer interaction affects weaker-superconductivity {{component of a}} two-gap system as an external field associated with the order parameter, similarly to an external magnetic <b>field</b> <b>for</b> ferromagnetics or an external electric <b>field</b> <b>for</b> ferroelectrics.

5|$|The {{building}} is complemented at the University by its predecessors the Henry Crown Field House {{and the modern}} incarnation of Stagg Field, which will continue to augment the athletic facilities needs of the campus patrons. Features of the indoor Henry Crown Field House include a 200-meter indoor running track; racquetball, handball and squash courts; multipurpose courts; a multipurpose room; and cardiovascular and weight training equipment. The Stagg Field outdoor complex includes a 400-meter track, eight tennis courts, and <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> baseball, softball, American football and soccer.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{features}} an iconic 150-foot-tall central tower that is visible from many locations throughout the city, courtyards, stained glass, and gargoyles {{modeled on the}} faces of the architects. Just south of the main building is Alumni Field, the school's stadium, which serves as home to the school's football, boys' and girls' lacrosse, and track teams. During a major building renovation in 1978, a modern gymnasium was added to the southwest corner of the main building. Other athletic facilities include <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> baseball, softball, soccer, and lacrosse, and tennis courts.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{assault was}} preceded by a massive artillery bombardment {{that was meant to}} soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open <b>fields</b> <b>for</b> three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is {{in the range of}} 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75m (70–80yd). <b>Fields</b> <b>for</b> non-international matches may be 90–120m (100–130yd) length and 45–90m (50–100yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{no longer}} exists, and North Road has been renamed Northampton Road.
