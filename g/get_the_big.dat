2500|$|With Nash still out, D'Antoni started 2–3 as a Laker, {{a minimal}} {{improvement}} over Brown's 1–4 start. The team had {{been struggling to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> men Gasol and Howard involved in the new offense. Bryant was also adjusting, running more screen-rolls and fewer post ups {{than at any time}} in his career. Additionally, backup point guard Steve Blake had been out since an abdominal injury on November 11, and he would not return until late January. On November 30, the Lakers made 17 three-point field goals—tying a team record for a regulation game—in a 122–103 win over the Denver Nuggets. Free agent acquisition Antawn Jamison scored 33 points, the first time a Laker had scored 30 points as a reserve since Shaquille O'Neal in 1998. [...] Jamison also made five three-pointers, while Jodie Meeks scored 21 on a career-high seven three-pointers. [...] Howard even added the second three-pointer of his career in addition to his 28 points and 20 rebounds. They lost 113–103 to the Orlando Magic the following home game in Howard's first matchup against his former team. He had 21 points and 15 rebounds, but he was intentionally fouled and shot only 9–for-21 on his free throws.|$|E
