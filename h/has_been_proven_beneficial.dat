40|$|The {{sharing of}} {{association}} rules <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>beneficial</b> in business collaboration, but requires privacy safeguards.

Some companies prefer to share their data for collaboration, while others prefer to share only the patterns discovered from their data. The challenge here is how to protect the sensitive rules without putting at risk the effectiveness of data mining per se. To address this challenging problem, we propose a unified framework which combines techniques for efficiently hiding sensitive rules: a set of algorithms to protect sensitive knowledge in transactional databases; retrieval facilities to speed up the process of protecting sensitive knowledge; and a set of metrics {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed algorithms in terms of information loss and to quantify how much private information has been disclosed.

40|$|The {{sharing of}} data <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>beneficial</b> in data mining applications. However, privacy {{regulations}} and other privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. To resolve this challenging problem, data owners must design {{a solution that}} meets privacy requirements and guarantees valid data clustering results. To achieve this dual goal, we introduce a new method for privacy-preserving clustering, called Dimensionality Reduction-Based Transformation (DRBT). This method relies on the intuition behind random projection to protect the underlying attribute values subjected to cluster analysis. The major features of this method are: a) it is independent of distance-based clustering algorithms; b) it has a sound mathematical foundation; and c) {{it does not require}} CPU-intensive operations. We show analytically and empirically that transforming a dataset using DRBT, a data owner can achieve privacy preservation and get accurate clustering with a little overhead of communication cost.
