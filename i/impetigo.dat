The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division would cross the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and {{to be in a}} position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Impetigo</b> is {{more likely}} to infect {{children}} ages 2–5, especially those that attend school or day care. 70% of cases are the nonbullous form and 30% were the bullous form. Other factors can increase the risk of contracting <b>impetigo</b> such as diabetes mellitus, dermatitis, immunodeficiency disorders, and other irritable skin disorders. <b>Impetigo</b> occurs more frequently among people who live in warm climates.|$|E
25|$|Globally, <b>impetigo</b> affects {{more than}} 162 million {{children}} in low to middle income countries. The rates are highest {{in countries with}} low available resources and is especially {{in the region of}} Oceania. The tropical climate and high population in lower socioeconomic regions contribute to these high rates. In children in the United Kingdom under the age of 4 are 2.8% more likely to contract <b>impetigo</b> and rates decreases to 1.6% for children up to 15-years-old. As age increases, the rates of <b>impetigo</b> declines but all ages are still susceptible.|$|E
25|$|This {{most common}} form of <b>impetigo,</b> also called nonbullous <b>impetigo,</b> most often begins as a red sore near the nose or mouth which soon breaks, leaking pus or fluid, and forms a honey-colored scab, {{followed}} by a red mark which heals without leaving a scar. Sores are not painful, but they may be itchy. Lymph nodes in the affected area may be swollen, but fever is rare. Touching or scratching the sores may easily spread the infection {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Skin {{infections are}} {{the most common form of}} S. aureus infection. This can {{manifest}} in various ways, including small benign boils, folliculitis, <b>impetigo,</b> cellulitis, and more severe, invasive soft-tissue infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Impetigo</b> is {{primarily}} caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and sometimes by Streptococcus pyogenes. Both bullous and nonbullous are primarily caused by S. aureus, with Streptococcus also commonly {{being involved in}} the nonbullous form.|$|E
25|$|Bullous <b>impetigo,</b> mainly seen in {{children}} younger than 2 years, involves painless, fluid-filled blisters, mostly on the arms, legs, and trunk, surrounded by red and itchy (but not sore) skin. The blisters may be large or small. After they break, they form yellow scabs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Impetigo</b> {{is usually}} {{diagnosed}} {{based on its}} appearance. It generally appears as honey-colored scabs formed from dried serum, and is often found on the arms, legs, or face. If a visual diagnosis is unclear a culture may be done to test for resistant bacteria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Impetigo</b> is a {{bacterial}} infection {{that involves the}} superficial skin. The most common presentation is yellowish crusts on the face, arms, or legs. Less commonly there may be large blisters which affect the groin or armpits. The lesions may be painful or itchy. Fever is uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as <b>impetigo,</b> cellulitis, and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and glomerulonephritis.|$|E
25|$|Ecthyma, the nonbullous form of <b>impetigo,</b> {{produces}} painful fluid- or pus-filled sores with redness of skin, {{usually on}} the arms and legs, become ulcers that penetrate deeper into the dermis. After they break open, they form hard, thick, gray-yellow scabs, which sometimes leave scars. Ecthyma may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the affected area.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{spread of}} <b>impetigo</b> {{to other people}} the skin and any open wounds should be kept clean. Care {{should be taken to}} keep fluids from an {{infected}} person away from the skin of a non-infected person. Washing hands, linens, and affected areas will lower the likelihood of contact with infected fluids. Sores should be covered with a bandage. Scratching can spread the sores; keeping nails short will reduce the chances of spreading. Infected people should avoid contact with others and eliminate sharing of clothing or linens.|$|E
25|$|Handwashing {{with soap}} {{consistently}} at critical moments {{during the day}} prevents the spread of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes. Handwashing also protects against <b>impetigo</b> which is transmitted through direct physical contact. People can become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, {{if they do not}} wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. As a general rule, hand washing protects people poorly or not at all from droplet and airborne diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005, the {{drinking}} water crisis of the Kashechewan First Nation received national media attention when E. coli was discovered in their water supply system, following two years of living under a boil-water advisory. The drinking water was supplied by a new treatment plant built in March 1998. The cause of the tainted water was a plugged chlorine injector that was not discovered by local operators, who were not qualified to be running the treatment plant. When officials arrived and fixed the problem, chlorine levels were around 1.7mg/l, which was blamed for skin disorders such as <b>impetigo</b> and scabies. An investigation led by Health Canada revealed that the skin disorders were likely due to living in squalor. The evacuation of Kashechewan was largely viewed by Canadians as a cry for help for other underlying social and economic issues which Aboriginal people in Canada face.|$|E

500|$|Primary {{orofacial}} herpes {{is readily}} identified by clinical examination {{of persons with}} no previous history of lesions and contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores in these individuals typically presents as multiple, round, superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute gingivitis. Adults with atypical presentation {{are more difficult to}} diagnose. Prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions help differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of other disorders, such as allergic stomatitis. [...] When lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is sometimes mistaken for <b>impetigo,</b> a bacterial infection. Common mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcer) also resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Impetigo</b> is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} skin infection. They appear as red or yellowish bumps and sores that are clustered together they may increase in size. The sores can burst which then crust over with a yellowish or brownish scab. This infection can be spread by coming into contact with {{a person who has}} the infection. Another way to contract <b>impetigo</b> is by touching or using equipment or from the mats that are infected by the bacteria. If <b>impetigo</b> is left untreated other infections could occur which can cause serious health issues. The bumps cause no pain although, they may be itchy. Once the blisters pop they crust over with a yellow brownish scab but, they can still be red and itchy. Mayo clinic states that [...] "Classic signs and symptoms of <b>impetigo</b> involve red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores usually occur around the nose and mouth but can be spread to other areas of the body by fingers, clothing and towels". <b>Impetigo</b> comes from a bacterium known as staphylococcus aureus.|$|E

Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The name is from the Latin impetere meaning [...] "attack".|$|E
2500|$|S. pyogenes (GAS) is the causative {{agent in}} a wide range of group A streptococcal infections. These infections may be noninvasive or invasive. The noninvasive infections tend to be more common and less severe.

2500|$|Severe {{cases of}} cradle cap, {{especially}} with cracked or bleeding skin, {{can provide a}} place for bacteria to grow. If the cradle cap {{is caused by a}} fungal infection which has worsened significantly over days or weeks to allow bacterial growth (<b>impetigo,</b> most commonly), a combination treatment of antibiotics and antifungals may be necessary. [...] Since it is difficult for a layperson to distinguish the difference between sebaceous gland cradle cap, fungal cradle cap, or either of these combined with a bacterial infection, medical advice should be sought if the condition appears to worsen.|$|E
2500|$|Staphylococcus {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1880 in Aberdeen, Scotland, by surgeon Sir Alexander Ogston in pus from a surgical abscess in a knee joint. This name was later amended to Staphylococcus aureus by Friedrich Julius Rosenbach, who was credited {{by the official}} system of nomenclature at the time. An estimated 20% to 30% of the human population are long-term carriers of S. aureus {{which can be found}} as part of the normal skin flora, in the nostrils, and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of women. S. aureus can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections, such as pimples, <b>impetigo,</b> boils, cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, scalded skin syndrome, and abscesses, to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis.

6000|$|Under such media the disease, par excellence, of the Gaboon is the {{paroxysm}} {{which is}} variously called Coast, African, Guinea, and Bullom fever. Dr. Ford, {{who has written}} a useful treatise upon the subject,[FN#7] finds hebdomadal periodicity in the attacks, and lays great stress upon this point of chronothermalism. He recognizes the normal stages, preparatory, invasional, reactionary, and resolutionary. Like Drs. Livingstone and Hutchinson, he holds fever and quinine [...] "incompatibles," [...] and he highly approves of the prophylactic adhibition of chinchona used by the unfortunate Douville in 1828. Experience in his own person and in numerous patients [...] "proves all theoretical objections to the use of six grains an hour, or fifty and sixty grains of quinine in one day or remission to be absolutely imaginary." [...] He is [...] "convinced {{that it is not a}} stimulant," [...] and with many apologies he cautiously sanctions alcohol, which should often be the physician's mainstay. As he advocated ten-grain doses of calomel by way of preliminary cathartic, the American missionaries stationed on the River have adopted a treatment still more [...] "severe"--quinine till deafness ensues, and half a handful of mercury, often continued till a passage opens through the palate, placing mouth and nose in directer communication. Dr. Ford also recommends during the invasion or period of chills external friction of mustard or of fresh red pepper either in tincture or in powder, a good alleviator always procurable; and the internal use of pepper-tea, to bring on the stages of reaction and resolution. Few will agree with him that gruels and farinaceous articles are advisable during intermissions, when the patient craves for port, essence of beef, and consomme; nor can we readily admit the dictum that in the tropics [...] "the most wholesome diet, without doubt, is chiefly vegetable." [...] Despite Jacquemont and all the rice-eaters, I cry beef and beer for ever and everywhere!
