States that have adopted the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), which includes the MBE, generally accept UBE and MBE scores from other UBE jurisdictions, but policies and minimum scores vary between jurisdictions. In non-UBE jurisdictions, policies vary even more widely. Some will not accept an MBE score from any other jurisdiction; some others only accept MBE scores from another jurisdiction if the applicant is concurrently taking the bar exam in two jurisdictions; still others require a minimum MBE score for transfer.

50|$|After {{admission}} to the bar, an eighteen-months apprenticeship program begins which is highly regulated {{under the auspices of}} Bar Syndicate Rules and supervision of an assigned First Degree Attorney. Trainees or apprentices must attend designated courts for designated weeks to hear cases and write case summaries. A logbook signed by the judge on the bench has to certify their weekly attendance. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} month, they are eligible to apply to take the Final Bar Exam by submitting their case summaries, the logbook and a research work pre-approved by the Bar. It is noteworthy, however, that during these eighteen months, Trainees are eligible to have a limited practice of law under the supervision of their supervising Attorney. This practice does not include Supreme Court eligible cases and certain criminal and civil cases.Candidates will be tested on Civil law, Civil Procedure, Criminal law, Criminal Procedure, Commercial Law, Notary (including rules pertaining Official Documents, Land & Real Estate registrations and regulations etc.). Each exam takes two days, a day on oral examination in front of a judge or an attorney, and a day of <b>essay</b> <b>examination,</b> in which they will be tested on hypothetical cases submitted to them. Successful applicants will be honoured with the title of “First Degree Attorney”, after they take the oath and can practice in all courts of the country including the Supreme Court.

40|$|The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) {{appears to}} be an {{effective}} alternative for assessing not only medical knowledge, but also clinical skills, including effective communication and physical examination skills. The purpose of the current study was to implement an OSCE model in a geriatrics fellowship program and to compare the instrument with traditional <b>essay</b> <b>examination.</b> Seventy first- and second-year geriatric fellows were initially submitted to a traditional <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> and scored from 0 to 10 by a faculty member. The same fellows subsequently underwent an OSCE with eight 10 -minute stations covering a wide range of essential aspects of geriatric knowledge. Each OSCE station had an examiner responsible for its evaluation according to a predefined checklist. Checklist items were classified for analysis purposes as clinical knowledge items (CKI) and communication skills items (CSI); fellow responses were scored from 0 to 10. Although essay examinations took from 30 to 45 minutes to complete, 180200 minutes were required to evaluate fellows using the proposed OSCE method. Fellows scored an average of 6. 2 +/- 1. 2 on the traditional <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> and 6. 6 +/- 1. 0 on the OSCE (P <. 001). Subanalyses of OSCE scores indicated that average performance on CKI was lower than the average on CSI (6. 4 +/- 1. 1 vs. 8. 4 +/- 1. 1; P <. 001). Fellow performance on the <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> was similar to their performance on CKI (P =. 13).

Students were evaluated on 4 essays written during the 10 -week quarter and a final in-class essay. This final <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> focused on a common theme, was evaluated by at least two members of the faculty, and was gradea on a 6 -point scale based upon a rubric developed by the Freshman English Committee. During the 1992 - 93 academic year, 168 foreign and immigrant students enrolled in Composition I classes for ESL students. Of this number, 76 passed the final <b>essay</b> <b>examination,</b> 84 failed, and 8 withdrew from the course. Of the 90 ESL students who enrolled in mainstream sections of Composition I, 30 passed, 38 failed, and 22 withdrew.

40|$|Certifying the {{competence}} of neurosurgeons {{is a process of}} critical importance to the people of Australia and New Zealand. This process of certification occurs largely through the summative assessment of trainees involved in higher neurosurgical training. Assessment methods in higher training in neurosurgery vary widely between nations. However, there are no data about the 'utility' (validity, reliability, educational impact) of any national (or bi-national) neurosurgical training system. The utility of this process in Australia and New Zealand is difficult to study directly because of the small number of trainees and examiners involved in the certifying assessments. This study is aimed at providing indirect evidence of utility by studying a greater number of trainees and examiners during a formative assessment conducted at a training seminar in Neurosurgery in April 2005. AIM: To evaluate an <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> for neurosurgical trainees for its validity, reliability and educational impact. METHODS: A short answer <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> was undertaken by 59 trainees and corrected by up to nine examiners per part of question. The marking data were analysed. An evaluation questionnaire was answered by 48 trainees. Eight trainees who successfully passed the Fellowship examination who had also taken the short <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> underwent a semi-structured interview. RESULTS: The <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> was found to be neither reliable (generalisability coefficient of 0. 56 if the essay paper had comprised 6 questions) nor v alid. Furthermore, evidence suggests that such an examination may encourage a pursuit of declarative knowledge at the expense of competence in performing neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: This analysis is not directly applicable to the Fellowship examination itself. However, this study does suggest that the effect of assessment instruments upon neurosurgical trainees' learning strategies should be carefully considered. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{feedback}} on performance and {{factors associated with}} it were examined in a large introductory psychology course. The experiment involved college students (N 464) working on an <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> under 3 conditions: no feedback, detailed feedback that was perceived by participants to be provided by the course instructor, and detailed feedback that was perceived by participants to be computer generated. Additionally, these conditions were crossed with factors of grade (receiving a numerical grade or not) and praise (receiving a statement of praise or not). The task under consideration was a single-question <b>essay</b> <b>examination</b> administered {{at the beginning of}} the course. Detailed feedback on the essay, specific to individual’s work, was found to be strongly related to student improvement in essay scores, with the influence of grades and praise being more complex. Generally, receipt of a tentative grade depressed performance, although this effect was ameliorated if accompanied by a statement of praise. Overall, detailed, descriptive feedback was found to be most effective when given alone, unaccompanied by grades or praise. It was also found that the perceived source of the feedback (the computer or the instructor) had little impact on the results. These findings are consistent with the research literature showing that descriptive feedback, which conveys information on how one performs the task and details ways to overcome difficulties, is far more effective than evaluative feedback, which simply informs students about how well they did...|$|E
