5|$|South Asian music {{places a}} special {{emphasis}} on drumming, which is freed from the primary time-keeping function of drumming found in {{other part of the}} world. In North India, secular processional bands {{play an important role in}} civic festival parades and the bārāt processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (ḍaphalā), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (nagāṛā). Better-off <b>families</b> <b>will</b> add shawms (shehnai) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band. The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition of instrumental temple music in the state of Kerala, called kṣētram vādyam. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. Thayambaka in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called chenda, played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other chenda and elathalam (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, panchavadyam and pandi melam add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A panchavadyam piece typically lasts about an hour, while a pandi melam performance may be as long as four hours.|$|E

The <b>family</b> <b>will</b> be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, the <b>family</b> <b>will</b> be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to food, drink {{is also important}} to the tradition of Day of the Dead. Historically, the main alcoholic drink was pulque while today <b>families</b> <b>will</b> commonly drink the favorite beverage of their deceased ancestors.

25|$|Opossums {{are usually}} solitary and nomadic, staying {{in one area}} as long as food and water are easily available.

25|$|In September 2012, Singapore welcomed its newest {{radio station}} in over 20 years, KISS 92 FM, raising the number of radio {{stations}} from 18 to 19 on the island. Following a tender for bids on two open dial positions, the media company SPH UnionWorks Pte Ltd was successful in procuring the one opening that was ultimately allotted at 92.0MHz with a proposal to have the station target mainly women listeners, but {{also included in the}} anticipated target audience – families. It provides in-depth women and family content, coupled with adult contemporary music. Women aged 30 and above, and <b>families</b> <b>will</b> find the channel informative and entertaining.|$|E
25|$|While <b>families</b> <b>will</b> often try {{to protect}} their women from rape and may also put their daughters on {{contraception}} to prevent visible signs should it occur, there is rarely much social pressure to control young men or persuade them that coercing sex is wrong. Instead, in some countries, there is frequently support for family members to {{do whatever is necessary}} including murder to alleviate the shame associated with a rape or other sexual transgression. In a review of all crimes of honor occurring in Jordan in 1995, researchers found that in over 60% of the cases, the victim died from multiple gunshot wounds mostly {{at the hands of a}} brother. In cases where the victim was a single pregnant female, the offender was either acquitted of murder or received a reduced sentence.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} poor and {{vulnerable}} <b>families</b> <b>will</b> fare much better under the Labour Party {{than they would}} under a Cameron-led Conservative Party. Gordon Brown has consistently prioritised and introduced measures that will save as many children as possible from a life lacking in opportunity or choice. The Labour government has reversed the long-term trend in child poverty, {{and is one of}} the leading EU countries in combating child poverty. David Cameron's promise of tax perks for the married, on the other hand, is reminiscent of the Conservative government I experienced as a lone parent. It sends the message that the Conservatives still believe a childless, dual-income, but married couple is more deserving of a financial pat on the head than those struggling, as I once was, to keep their families afloat in difficult times.|$|E

25|$|A {{holiday centre}} is a {{facility}} that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an INF card, that is, {{be a member of}} their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares. In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same <b>families</b> <b>will</b> visit each year. Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage {{is whether or not}} the children of these <b>families</b> <b>will</b> grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The purpose of this article was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do. This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E
25|$|Families tend to {{seek out}} schools whose {{principal}} languages they share, and ideally one which mirrors their own educational system. Many countries have American schools, French schools, British schools, German Schools and 'International Schools' which often follow {{one of the three}} International Baccalaureate programs. These will be populated by expatriates' children and some children of the local upper middle class. They do this in an effort to maintain linguistic stability and to ensure that their children do not fall behind due to linguistic problems. Where their own language is not available, <b>families</b> <b>will</b> often choose English-speaking schools for their children. They do this because of the linguistic and cultural opportunities being immersed in English might provide their children when they are adults, and because their children {{are more likely to have}} prior exposure to English than to other international languages. This poses the potential for non-English speaking TCKs to have a significantly different experience from TCKs for whom English is a native language. Research on TCKs from Japan, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the United States and Africa has shown that TCKs from different countries share more in common with other TCKs than they do with their own peer group from their passport country.|$|E

25|$|The vast Majority of Middle Eastern Jewish {{communities}} {{descend from}} the earliest Assyrian (late 8th Century BCE) and Babylonian (6th Century BCE) Hebrew exiles, whose mtDNA pools virtually lack sub-Saharan L and North and East African-specific M1 and U6 mtDNA variants. Secondly, the Ashkenazi and North African Jews with a low, but still detectable share of L lineages with very low diversity. This low diversity is most easily explained by {{a limited number of}} unique Hg L(xM,N) founders. The third example brings together Ethiopian and Yemenite Jews, rich in Hg L(xM,N) and Hg M1 (in particular in Ethiopian Jews) (Tables S1 and Table S3). As far as Ethiopian and Yemenite Jews are concerned, the main observation here is not in the absolute frequency of Hg L(xM,N) among them, but rather its high diversity, in particular among Beta Israel (Tables S1 and Table S3). Furthermore, samples of Ethiopian and Yemenite Jewish mtDNA pools differ considerably in relative abundance of typically West Asian mtDNA lineages such as derivatives of HV1, JT and others (Tables S1 and Table S3), virtually absent in the former...Maternal DNA of Mizrachi Jews is varied, even slightly from other Mizrachim, indicating likely majority Israelite and some non-Israelite origin from among the women of each of the Near Eastern populations; e.g. Yemeni, Mesopotamian, and other local Near Eastern women. DNA markings, however, are irrelevant when considering that, in Jewish law, proselytes who may have joined the religion of Israel and married into Israelite <b>families,</b> <b>will</b> still pass on their DNA readings to their children.|$|E
