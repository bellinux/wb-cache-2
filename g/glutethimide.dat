The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a Substitutionmittel that may be a useful alternative to methadone. The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of <b>glutethimide</b> since 1984, a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when less-than-gifted chemists are doing the deed with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control. The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like ethchlorvynol, methyprylon, or the oldest barbiturates is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like methaqualone. Doriden was discontinued in the US by manufacturers in 1993. Analysis of confiscated <b>glutethimide</b> seems to invariably show the drug or the results of attempted synthesis, whereas purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.|$|E

40|$|Relationships between {{activities}} of delta-aminolevulinate synthase and heme oxygenase, respectively the rate-limiting enzymes of heme biosynthesis and degradation, {{have been studied}} in chick embryo liver cell cultures following exposure of the cultures to <b>glutethimide</b> and iron, a combination known to produce a synergistic induction of both enzymes. In time-course experiments, synergistic induction of heme oxygenase activity by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron preceded that of delta-aminolevulinate synthase by 4 h.

40|$|A simple, rapid, {{quantitative}} {{method for}} the simultaneous analysis of bar bitu rates and <b>glutethimide</b> (2 -ethyl- 2 -phenylgluta rimide) is described. The procedure involves a single chloroform extraction from a sample buf-fered at pH 7. 4 and requires {{less than an}} hour. T HE POSSIBILITY OF DRUG intoxication fre-quently arises in patients {{admitted to the hospital}} in coma. Ingestion of salicylates by children and of barbiturates by adults are the most common causes. Since the introduction of <b>glutethimide</b> (2 -ethyl- 2 -phenylglutarimide) in 1954, there have been increasing reports impli-cating this drug in drug intoxication. Since the clinical picture of <b>glutethimide</b> intoxication is indistinguishable from that of barbiturates, diag-nosis must be confirmed by identifying the drug in blood samples. Well-established ultraviolet spectrophotometric methods are available for identification of these substances (1, 2). Each of these procedures requires about 2 h for com-pletion. Because the laboratory is often asked to look for both barbiturates and <b>glutethimide,</b> it seemed desirable to combine the analytical procedures. Measurement of <b>glutethimide</b> is based on its characteristic absorption peak at 233 nm in a strongly alkaline solution and its progressive timed hydrolysis.

40|$|Primary chick embryo liver {{cells were}} used to explore the {{regulation}} of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase and heme oxygenase, the enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting reactions of heme anabolism and catabolism, respectively. The general focus of the work was {{the exploration of the}} novel observation in which <b>glutethimide</b> and iron synergistically induced both δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase and heme oxygenase, a phenomenon that would not be predicted a priori. The course of events appeared to be: first, that heme synthesis was increased after addition of the <b>glutethimide</b> and that iron potentiated heme synthesis; second, the heme induced heme oxygenase five to ten fold; and third, that heme oxygenase degraded the heme permitting an uncontrolled induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase. This induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase could be prevented by the addition of a metalloporphyrin inhibitor of heme oxygenase. Induced δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity could be dramatically reduced by the addition of nanomolar concentrations of a metalloporphyrin, inhibitory for heme oxygenase, and heme. Specific observations related to the synergistic induction of heme oxygenase by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron was that the induction of heme oxygenase activity by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron occurred rapidly, with maximal increases occurring four to six hours after original treatment. Induction of heme oxygenase by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron was shown to be dependent on de novoheme synthesis since 4, 6 -dioxoheptanoic acid, a potent and specific inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, prevented the activity of heme oxygenase from increasing in the presence of <b>glutethimide</b> and iron. Induction of activity was associated with increases in heme oxygenase mRNA and protein; and, when induction was prevented by 4, 6 -dioxoheptanoic acid, no increase in either mRNA or immunoreactive protein was observed. δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthase activity was also synergistically increased by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron; this increase occurred 4 - 6 hours after maximal heme oxygenase activity had been attained. The temporal relationship between the induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase and heme oxygenase suggested that the oxygenase depleted a regulatory heme pool that would normally prevent uncontrolled induction of the synthase. When cultures were exposed to tin-mesoporphyrin, a potent inhibitor of heme oxygenase, induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, normally produced by <b>glutethimide</b> and iron, was prevented. Addition of tin-mesoporphyrin after δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase induction had already been established promptly halted any further induction. When heme or a combination of heme and tin-mesoporphyrin was added after induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase was established, activity of the synthase was rapidly reduced. Finally, experiments in primary chick embryo liver cells with tin-, zinc- and copper- chelated porphyrins were done to assess their effects on activities of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, induced by prior treatment of cells with <b>glutethimide</b> and iron. Nanomolar concentrations of zinc- or tin porphyrins reduced δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase activities, while copper-chelated porphyrins did not. When nanomolar concentrations of heme were added with zinc- or tin-porphyrins, δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity was further reduced. Effects of the non-heme metalloporphyrins on δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase were closely correlated with their abilities to inhibit heme oxygenase (r= 0. 78). The largest decrease of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase (67 %) was obtained with zinc-mesoporphyrin and heme. There was a rapid appearance of the cytosolic, precursor form of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase in the presence of both 10 μM heme or 50 nM zinc-mesoporphyrin and 200 nM heme. Reduction of the half-life of the mRNA from 5. 2 hours to 2. 2 - 2. 5 hours was observed in the presence of both 10 μM heme or 50 nM zinc-mesoporphyrin and 200 nM heme. In summary, the chick embryo liver cell culture model treated with <b>glutethimide</b> and iron may serve as one experimental model for patients suffering from acute porphyrias, in whom uncontrolled induction of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase {{plays a key role in}} pathogenesis of disease. The synergistic induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase in the presence of <b>glutethimide</b> and iron may serve as an experimental paradigm for this disease. The reduction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase by low doses of zinc-mesoporphyrin and heme may help form the experimental foundation for eventual studies in patients suffering from acute porphyrias...|$|E

Even patients with very severe liver disease did undergo microsomal enzyme induction. Changes in antipyrine half-life after <b>glutethimide</b> were directly proportional to the original antipyrine half-life so that the greatest absolute alterations due to enzyme induction occurred in patients with the most severely impaired hepatic function. These results indicate that not only is antipyrine metabolism severely impaired in patients with liver failure, but elimination rates are markedly altered by enzyme inducing agents. Thus, although these results cannot be extrapolated to all inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes nor to all drugs metabolized by microsomal oxidases, it is suggested that safe and effective management of drug therapy in these patients requires measurement of plasma levels...|$|E

This led to studies on the use of hemodialysis (6 - 7) as a means of therapy. When this approach was found to be less successful than desired, the use of lipid-containing solutions (“Lipomul,...|$|E

40|$|Barbiturates and <b>glutethimide</b> can be {{identified}} and measured in whole blood, plasma, or serum in 20 mm. An internal standard containing known amounts of five common barbiturates {{is added to the}} sample, the sample is acidified, and the sedatives are extracted rapidly into toluene, then from the toluene into a small volume of aqueous tetraethylammonium hydroxide. An aliquot of this last extract is introduced directly into the gas chromatograph, where the barbiturates are converted to their ethyl deriva-tives and separated on a silicone column. They are identified by observing which of the internal standard peaks has increased and measured by measuring the extent of increase. <b>Glutethimide</b> can be determined on the same chromatogram. Mephobarbital and phenobarbital can be simulta-neously determined. The admitting office of any large general hos-pital can expect to encounter several cases of drug overdose nearly every week. Many of these case...|$|E
