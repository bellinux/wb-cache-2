2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A passive {{crossover}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, {{passive crossover}}s have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil [...] An active crossover is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E

50|$|A {{new class}} of audio {{amplifiers}} based on the PWM principle is becoming popular. Called class-D amplifiers, they produce a PWM equivalent of the analog input signal which is fed to the loudspeaker via a suitable <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> to block the carrier and recover the original audio. These amplifiers are characterized by very good efficiency figures (≥ 90%) and compact size/light weight for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving servo motors. Field-gradient coils in MRI machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|Precise {{technical}} terms and their definitions are formally recognised, documented, and taught by {{educators in the}} field. Other terms are more colloquial, coined and used by practitioners in the field, and are similar to slang. The boundaries between formal and slang jargon, as in general English, are quite fluid. This {{is especially true in}} the rapidly developing world of computers and networking.

50|$|A filter that corrects {{a limited}} band of {{frequencies}} (that is, a filter {{that is in}} phase everywhere except in the band being corrected) {{can be obtained by}} applying the band-stop transformation to the prototype filter.

50|$|All-pass {{networks}} {{are an important}} sub-class of lattice networks.

5000|$|Since the AM {{detector}} diode {{produces a}} DC voltage proportional to signal strength, this {{voltage can be}} fed back to earlier stages of the receiver to reduce gain. A <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> is required so that the audio components of the signal don't appreciably influence gain; this prevents [...] "modulation rise" [...] which increases the effective modulation depth of the signal, distorting the sound. Communications receivers may have more complex AVC systems, including extra amplification stages, separate AGC detector diodes, different time constants for broadcast and shortwave bands, and application of different levels of AGC voltage to different stages of the receiver to prevent distortion and cross-modulation. Design of the AVC system has a great effect on the usability of the receiver, tuning characteristics, audio fidelity, and behavior on overload and strong signals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{roll-off}} {{stems from the}} fact that in many networks roll-off tends towards a constant gradient at frequencies well away from the cut-off point of the frequency curve. Roll-off enables the cut-off performance of such a <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> to be reduced to a single number. Note that roll-off can occur with decreasing frequency as well as increasing frequency, depending on the [...] of the filter being considered: for instance a low-pass filter will roll-off with increasing frequency, but a high-pass filter or the lower stopband of a band-pass filter will roll-off with decreasing frequency. For brevity, this article describes only low-pass filters. This is to be taken in the spirit of prototype filters; the same principles may be applied to high-pass filters by interchanging phrases such as [...] "above cut-off frequency" [...] and [...] "below cut-off frequency".|$|E
50|$|A 70cm {{signal path}} {{goes through a}} high pass <b>filter</b> <b>network,</b> through the RF {{directional}} coupler/power detector (not on rx) to a low pass filter to a PIN-diode. In rx mode, these are turned off. The rx signal then passes through a DAN235U; this is a dual diode and when in UHF rx mode, the appropriate diode is turned on, passing the 70 cm signal through and the signal then leaves the PA board. On the MAIN circuit board the 70 cm rx signal enters a DAP236U. This dual diode get its current from the PA unit and when 70 cm rx mode is active one of the diodes is turned on. Rx signal goes through a device consisting of 2 back-to-back diodes providing protection for the receiver's front end. The output of the preamplifier is sent to a helical resonator filter. The output of the filtered and amplified 70 cm path is passed through and coupled into the receive mixer. For 70 cm receive, PIN diode bias is provided to the PA unit, through the MAIN unit and then through an RF-decoupler network, a parallel-output shift register.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{invention}} is to provide an instrument for converting a physiological pulse rate into a corresponding linear output voltage. The instrument which accurately measures the rate of an unknown rectangular pulse wave over an extended range of values comprises a phase-locked loop including a phase comparator, a <b>filtering</b> <b>network,</b> and a voltage-controlled oscillator, arranged in cascade. The phase comparator has a first input responsive to the pulse wave and a second input responsive to the output signal of the voltage-controlled oscillator. The comparator provides a signal dependent on the difference in phase and frequency between the signals appearing on {{the first and second}} inputs. A high-input impedance amplifier accepts an output from the <b>filtering</b> <b>network</b> and provides an amplified output DC signal to a utilization device for providing a measurement of the rate of the pulse wave...|$|R
5000|$|Intermodulation {{distortion}} (IMD) : Distortion {{that is not}} harmonically {{related to}} the signal being amplified is intermodulation distortion. It {{is a measure of}} the level of spurious signals resulting from unwanted combination of different frequency input signals. This effect results from non-linearities in the system. Sufficiently high levels of negative feedback can reduce this effect in an amplifier. Many believe it is better to design electronics in a way to minimize feedback levels, though this is difficult to achieve while meeting other high accuracy requirements. Intermodulation in loudspeaker drivers is, as with harmonic distortion, almost always larger than in most electronics. IMD increases with cone excursion. Reducing a driver's bandwidth directly reduces IMD. This is achieved by splitting the desired frequency range into separate bands and employing separate drivers for each band of frequencies, and feeding them through a crossover <b>filter</b> <b>network.</b> Steep slope crossover filters are most effective at IMD reduction, but may be too expensive to implement using high-current components and may introduce ringing distortion. Intermodulation distortion in multi-driver loudspeakers can be greatly reduced with the use of active crossover, though it significantly increases system cost and complexity.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{extension}} to Bartlett's theorem that allows a symmetrical <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> operating between equal input and output impedance terminations to be modified for unequal source and load impedances. This {{is an example of}} impedance scaling of a prototype filter. The symmetrical network is bisected along its plane of symmetry. One half is impedance-scaled to the input impedance and the other is scaled to the output impedance. The response shape of the filter remains the same. This does not amount to an impedance matching network, the impedances looking in to the network ports bear no relationship to the termination impedances. This means that a network designed by Bartlett's theorem, while having exactly the filter response predicted, also adds a constant attenuation in addition to the filter response. In impedance matching networks, a usual design criteria is to maximise power transfer. The output response is [...] "the same shape" [...] relative to the voltage of the theoretical ideal generator driving the input. It is not the same relative to the actual input voltage which is delivered by the theoretical ideal generator via its load impedance.|$|E
