25|$|He {{was taken}} to prison, where he {{remained}} for eight months, throughout which he was gravely ill; he lost nearly all of his eyesight and his <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> out. After this first imprisonment, Maroto was exiled to Seville and from there was able to obtain a transfer to Granada, where he reunited {{with his family and}} decided to rededicate his life to their care. After a time, he was secretly informed that he would be newly imprisoned and moved to a cell in Ceuta. Maroto rapidly prepared his escape, disguised, helped physically and economically by friends and accompanied and guided on the voyage by some smugglers.|$|E
500|$|The central {{icon of the}} Jaganmohini-Kesava Swany temple at Ryali, {{discovered}} buried underground by {{the king}} [...] in the 11th century, represents the male Vishnu in the front, while {{the back of the}} icon is the female Jagan-Mohini ("one who deludes the world") or Mohini, with a female hairdo and figure. A Sthala Purana tells that the flower in Mohini's <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> at Ryali ("fall" [...] in Telugu) when Mohini was being chased by Shiva.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2002, Osbourne {{had surgery}} for cancer, specifying {{only that it}} was a treatable form and that she was due to have the {{procedure}} in the US. She announced it was colon cancer and had spread to her lymph nodes and was more serious than originally thought. She survived the disease against a 33% survival prognosis. Despite battling cancer, she insisted that the MTV cameras document her illness during the filming of the second season of The Osbournes. When Osbourne's <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> out during her subsequent treatment, her wigs were custom made by Cher's wigmaker. Ozzy Osbourne admitted that he [...] "fell apart" [...] during her treatment and recovery, and it was revealed that her son, Jack Osbourne, tried to commit suicide because of his depression stemming from his mother's condition.|$|E

60|$|Elissa {{bowed her}} dark head till her gold-bedecked and scented <b>hair</b> almost <b>fell</b> upon his feet, {{but she made}} no answer.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} {{gave up trying to}} be calm, and {{likewise}} to fasten up her <b>hair,</b> which <b>fell</b> again in a golden mass.|$|R
2500|$|At 21 {{years of}} age he was {{diagnosed}} as having bipolar disorder, and has spoken candidly about his experiences {{with the effects of}} the illness. In his 31 December 2010 interview for The Sun, Ant also discussed the side effects of medication for his bipolar condition: [...] "In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on sodium valproate for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I {{might as well have been}} dead. I work very closely with my GP and any decisions I make are made with him". During an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music, he declared that [...] "mental health needs a great deal of attention. It's the final taboo and it needs to be faced and dealt with." [...] Ant is involved in the Black Dog campaign, which promotes better understanding of mental illness.|$|E
60|$|Swanhild {{sat on a}} couch. She was weeping, and her <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> {{about her}} face.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> {{about her}} {{shoulders}} like a tragic veil, while a sudden agony touched her young, white face.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted the}} uræus crown from her brows, and she shook loose her heavy weight of <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> about {{her like a}} garment.|$|R
60|$|She's kaimit out her lang black <b>hair,</b> That <b>fell</b> {{below her}} knee. She's ta'en the apple in her hand, To {{see what she}} might see.|$|R
5000|$|He did. The scarf {{slipped a}} little, the princess saw his <b>hair</b> and <b>fell</b> in love at once, and the king, though reluctant, let them marry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And others, like {{discoloured}} {{flakes of}} snow On fairest bosoms and the sunniest <b>hair,</b> <b>Fell,</b> and were melted by the youthful glow ...|$|E
60|$|Down {{the passage}} came a flutter of white garments; soft limbs were twined about her, some ends of <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> on her face.|$|E
60|$|There {{her voice}} {{ended in a}} sigh, and all her fair <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> down about her face, hiding it in a shining veil.|$|E
6000|$|... "My scalp {{is nothing}} to make an Indian very covetous, is it?" [...] said he, eyeing in admiration the {{magnificent}} black <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> over the hunter's shoulders.|$|R
60|$|He was a wild-eyed man {{of middle}} age, with long <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> over his {{sheepskin}} robe. To me {{he looked like}} a soothsayer. He stood before Pharaoh, making no salutation.|$|R
60|$|For answer {{he stroked}} with his {{withered}} hand the golden <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> disordered about his withered knees. She raised {{her eyes to}} him; they were filled with tears, but smiling.|$|R
60|$|He nodded slightly. She {{shook her}} head thoughtfully, and a few {{delicate}} petals of the flowers dying in her <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> like big drops of crimson and white at her feet.|$|E
60|$|With some impatience she {{snatched}} the mirror {{from the young}} slave's hand, and then she {{put it on the}} pillow and looked straight down into it, whilst her <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> like golden curtains down each side of her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! you {{ran from}} another clap," [...] said Julia, {{laughing}} till {{her dark eyes}} flashed with pleasure, and shaking her head until her glossy <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> in ringlets over her shoulders; [...] "you will never make a hero, Charles." ...|$|E
60|$|It was his wife's. She had {{exchanged}} {{her dinner}} dress for a loose robe, and unbound her <b>hair,</b> which <b>fell</b> freely about her neck. But {{this was not}} the change in her that startled him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it all settled, Harry?" [...] said Fanny, {{stopping}} {{with her}} brother, and hanging over his chair. She was a pretty, gay-spirited girl, with bright eyes and dark brown <b>hair,</b> which <b>fell</b> in two curls behind her ears.|$|R
6000|$|I {{raised her}} head, and {{smoothed}} away the tangled <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> over her face, and kissed her--my poor, faded flower! my lost, afflicted sister! [...] "You shall help us, Laura," [...] I said, [...] "you shall begin, my darling, to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} she {{approached}} {{one of the}} purple ornaments, and while the Queen watched her curiously the hen broke the Nome King's enchantment and a sweet-faced girl, whose golden <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> in a cloud over her shoulders, stood beside them.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head, {{and took off}} her shabby bonnet; her pretty light-brown <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> about her face and her shoulders. [...] "I think I'm too tired, sir, to be hungry. Might I take the sofa-pillow, {{and lay down on}} the hearth-rug?" ...|$|E
60|$|For in the portrait, {{there was}} nothing on the head, and one long lock of <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> on the {{shoulder}} of the low-cut white-satin dress, done in very heavy gray shading. The three girls came down together, and I asked who the lady was.|$|E
60|$|In {{the middle}} of the meadow stood a huge stone castle, with an iron gate leading to it, which was wide open. Everything in the castle seemed to be made of copper, and the only {{inhabitant}} he could discover was a lovely girl, who was combing her golden hair; and he noticed that whenever one of her <b>hairs</b> <b>fell</b> on the ground it rang out like pure metal. The youth looked at her more closely, and saw that her skin was smooth and fair, her blue eyes bright and sparkling, and her hair as golden as the sun. He {{fell in love with her}} on the spot, and kneeling at her feet, he implored her to become his wife.|$|R
60|$|She {{tore the}} belt off {{and threw it}} at Joanna's feet. She flung down with haste the armlets, the gold pins, the flowers; and the long <b>hair,</b> released, <b>fell</b> {{scattered}} over her shoulders, framing in its blackness the wild exaltation of her face.|$|R
60|$|Billie Bennett {{stood in}} front of the mirror in her state-room dreamily {{brushing}} the glorious red <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> in a tumbled mass about her shoulders. On the lounge beside her, swathed in a business-like grey kimono, Jane Hubbard watched her, smoking a cigarette.|$|R
60|$|The boy had Min's {{dark eyes}} and {{perfectly}} chiselled features, refined by suffering into cameo-like delicacy, and the silken <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> in soft, waving masses about the spiritual little face. By his side nestled a tiny dog, with satin ears and paws fringed as with ravelled silk.|$|E
60|$|A {{man took}} the hair {{in his hands}} and held it fast. Then Swart hewed with his axe, but the Dane twitched his head back so strongly, that he who was holding his <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> forward; the axe cut off both his hands, and stuck fast in the earth.|$|E
60|$|Her gold <b>hair</b> <b>fell</b> on {{the wall}} of gold Like the {{delicate}} gossamer tangles spun On the burnished disk of the marigold, Or the sunflower turning to meet the sun When the gloom of the dark blue night is done, And the spear of the lily is aureoled.|$|E
5000|$|Athénaïs was {{considered}} [...] "astonishingly beautiful" [...] {{by the standards}} of her time. She had large, blue eyes, long, thick, corn-coloured <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> in curls about her shoulders, and a curvaceous, voluptuous body. She was droll, amusing and used her considerable wit to mock others.|$|R
60|$|He was a weird {{figure of}} a man. Aged and lean, long-faced, hollow-checked, with matted, sunburnt <b>hair</b> that <b>fell</b> below the {{shoulders}} of his buckskin shirt, his face was distorted with hatred and helpless rage. Holding his long rifle in his bridle-hand, he shook his free fist at Cedar City.|$|R
60|$|Rilla {{was leaning}} {{out of her}} room window, dressed for the dance. A yellow pansy slipped from her <b>hair</b> and <b>fell</b> out over the sill like a falling star of gold. She caught at it vainly--but there were enough left. Miss Oliver had woven a little wreath of them for her pet's hair.|$|R
