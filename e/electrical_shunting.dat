A nonlinear rate-independent hysteresis model, the Ishlinskii hysteresis (IM) model, is experimentally identified for the PZT wafer by itself and then integrated into the coupled dynamic equations of the overall system consisting of the beam and electrically shunted PZT wafer. Experimental studies of the system validate the theoretical model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} the noise reduction performance of piezoelectric smart panels featuring piezoelectric shunt damping. A piezoelectric smart panel is a plate structure {{on which a}} piezoelectric patch with an <b>electrical</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit is attached. When an incidence sound is impinged on the panel structure, the structure vibrates and the attached piezoelectric patch produces electrical energy, which is effectively dissipated as heat via an <b>electrical</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit. Since the energy dissipation strongly depends on the vibration mode of the panel structure, many patches are required for multiple vibration modes. Instead of using multiple piezoelectric patches, a single piezoelectric patch is {{used in conjunction with}} blocked shunt circuit for multimode shunt damping. Modeling, shunt parameter tuning, and implementation of the blocked shunt circuit on the panels are explained.

40|$|Variable {{acoustic}} properties can {{be obtained}} at the diaphragm of an electroacoustic transducer, {{with the help of}} very basic control strategies, among which is the simple <b>electrical</b> <b>shunting</b> of the transducer. These shunt techniques are compared to active feedback techniques for controlling the acoustic impedance of an electroacoustic transducer. It is shown here that the formulation of feedback-based acoustic impedance control reveals formal analogies with shunt strategies, and highlights an interesting strategy for synthesizing electric networks capable of mimicking feedbacks on actual acoustic quantities, bridging a gap between passive and active acoustic impedance control. The present paper describes the underlying theory unifying all these passive and active acoustic impedance control strategies, introducing the concept of “electroacoustic absorber”. The formal equivalence between shunt and active feedback control is first formalized, on the one hand through the introduction of a 1 -degree-of freedom active acoustic resonator accounting for both electric shunts and acoustic feedbacks, {{and on the other hand}} through the introduction of equivalent electric networks that mimic the performances of acoustic feedbacks. Simulated acoustic performances are presented, followed by discussions on the design of active electric shunts in view of active sound absorption. At last, experimental assessments of the studied configurations are presented, with general discussions on the concept. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the olfactory sensitivity of the blackspot sea bream to amino acids, odorants associated with food detection in fsh, and compared the efficacy of two different experimental methods: multiunit recording from the olfactory nerve and the electro-olfactogram (EOG). Twenty essential amino acids plus L-DOPA evoked clear, concentration-dependent olfactory responses using both methods, with estimated thresholds of 10 - 8. 5 – 10 - 6. 2 M (nerve recording) and 10 - 7. 5 - 10 - 4. 8 M (EOG). The most potent amino acids were L-cysteine, L-methionine (both sulphur-containing), L-alanine, L-leucine (both neutral), L-glutamine (amide-containing) and L-serine (hydroxyl-containing). The least potent were L-proline (secondary alpha-amino group), the aromatic amino acids and glycine (simplest). Although the rank order of olfactory potency was similar for the two methods used, and the calculated thresholds given by the two methods were positively correlated, {{the sensitivity of the}} EOG was consistently lower than multi-unit recording by approximately one order of magnitude, presumably due to the <b>electrical</b> <b>shunting</b> effect of seawater.

By using the impedance method, the general modelling of different shunt piezoelectric damping techniques is presented. The piezoelectric shunt circuit can be seen as additional frequency-dependence damping of the system. One of the primary concerns in shunt damping is to choose the optimal parameters for shunt circuits. In past efforts most of the proposed tuning methods were based on modal properties of the structure.

Using measured current–voltage (I–V) and lock-in thermography (LIT) measurements of amor-phous silicon minimodules, we experimentally validate our model. The entire module volume {{is represented by}} two planes (front and back electrodes) which are coupled in vertical direction using 1 -D models, leading to a large reduction of the degrees of freedom in the numerical model and contributing to an efficient solution ap-proach. As compared to 3 -D models, the vertical coupling of the charge transport is represented by local temperature-dependent I–V curves. These {{can be obtained by}} drift–diffusion calculations, single-cell measurements or, as presented here, by an analytical so-lar cell diode model. Inhomogeneous heat sources such as Joule’s heating in the electrodes lead to nonuniform temperature distribu-tions. The explicit temperature dependence in the local I–V curve, therefore, mediates the feedback of the thermal transport on the lo-cal electrical cell characteristics.

In this work we present a noninvasive in situ method for identification of the plasma regime, based on optical emission spectroscopy (OES), which can be applied to silane=hydrogen plasmas at low substrate temperatures. By monitoring the OES spectra {{as a function of the}} position perpendicular to the plasma electrodes we developed a method to identify the transition of a plasma from the dust free to a dusty regime, which was confirmed by TEM images of layers deposited in both regimes. Using this technique we mapped this transition as a function of applied forward very-high frequency (VHF) power and hydrogen dilution at different substrate temperatures. The advantage of this technique is that the experiment is insensitive to optical transmission loss at the viewport due to deposition of silicon films. As the transition from the dust free to the dusty regime is substrate temperature dependent and the transition from amorphous to nanocrystalline growth mainly depends on hydrogen dilution, a limited parameter window has been defined in which dust-free amorphous silicon can be deposited at low substrate temperatures. A single simple OES technique can be used for in situ monitoring of amorphous to nanocrystalline transition as well as the onset of the dusty regime in a thin film silicon cell fabrication process...|$|R

It has {{the appearance of a}} metal ring, and can be installed between any two driveline components like an ordinary mechanical spacer. Damping is achieved using a ring-shaped piezoelectric stack that is poled in the axial direction and connected to an <b>electrical</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit. Surrounding the stack is a metal structure, called the compression cage, which squeezes the stack along its poled axis when excited by radial driveline forces.

The vibration ring is much stiffer than traditional damping devices, which allows it to be used in a driveline without disrupting normal operation. In phase 1 of this NASA Seedling Fund project, a combination of design and analysis was used to examine the feasibility of this concept. Several designs were evaluated using solid modeling, finite element analysis, and by creating prototype hardware. Then an analytical model representing the coupled electromechanical response was formulated in closed form.

We devised a passive detection method based on a patient's electrical voltages being transmitted via blood tubing to our alarm circuit. As the arterial and venous access sites are in close proximity, the signals are nearly identical during connection, and markedly different with disconnection. We built a prototype and tested it in vitro with saline and during hemodialysis treatments (n= 7). The connection status is determined by examining the difference between endogenous voltages in the blood tubing from and to the patient, and when it exceeds a threshold an alarm condition is triggered. We tested for possible confounding by an <b>electrical</b> <b>shunt</b> through the dialyzer and determined that pathway had an impedance approximately three times (> 350 [*]kΩ) that of the tubing to the patient. As the roller blood-pump periodically occluded the tubing, the resultant intermittent very high impedance prevented that potential shunting problem and improved the sensitivity of our device. Disconnections were detectable at various bloodline sites (needles, sampling ports, drip chambers). Thus, the circuit's sensors can be placed remotely at the dialysis machine, with electrical continuity to blood made by inexpensive conductive elements at the tubing wall or drip chambers.

Recently, the use of smart material-related components for vibration control has become an alternative to traditional vibration control techniques. Vibration control using such components has many advantages such as lighter overall weight and lower cost. They are especially suitable where traditional techniques cannot be applied due to weight and size restrictions. Passive vibration shunt control using piezoelectric ceramics (PZT) and an electrical network has been studied by many researchers both analytically and experimentally. In this paper, the modeling of a passive vibration shunt control on a cantilever beam using a finite element analysis software package [...] ANSYS is presented. It is a useful alternative to an experimental approach that is costly as the PZT is useable only once in most instances. The simulation shows that the <b>electrical</b> <b>shunt</b> circuit can remove considerable vibration-based energy when properly tuned.

The {{workshop}} was attended by 85 scientists and engineers from 15 international photovoltaic (PV) companies and 24 research institutions. Review and poster presentations were augmented by discussion sessions to address the recent progress and critical issues in meeting the goals for Si in the PV Industry Roadmap. The theme of the workshop was Si Photovoltaics: 10 Years of Progress and Opportunities for the Future. Two special sessions were held: Advanced Metallization and Interconnections - covering recent advances in solar cell metallization, printed contacts and interconnections, and addressing new metallization schemes for low-cost cell interconnections; and Characterization Methods - addressing the growing need for process monitoring techniques in the PV industry. The following major issues emerged from the discussion sessions: (1) Mechanical breakage in the P V industry involves a large fraction, about 5 %- 10 %, of the wafers. (2) The current use of Al screen-printed back-contacts appears to be incompatible with the PV Industry Roadmap requirements.

40|$|Varistors are {{critical}} components of many electrical circuits {{due to their}} <b>electrical</b> current <b>shunting</b> capabilities. Sandia National Laboratories’ (SNL) Ceramics and Glass Processing Department fabricates ZnO varistors for high voltage applications. These varistors are core drilled from a uni-axially pressed ceramic billet. Because ceramics can be easily damaged, the drilling process is timeintensive. Damage to the core while drilling can cause the completed varistor to fail catastrophically. The goal for this project is to maximize the drilling rate while minimizing defects introduced from drilling. The SNL drilling setup was replicated using the PCNC 1100 milling machine located at Boise State University’s (BSU) New Product Development Laboratory. Design of Experiments (DOE) {{was used to evaluate}} and characterize factors affecting the core drilling process. The characterization techniques utilized included optical and electron microscopy along with optical profilometry. Initial screening determined the factors statistically significant to the experiment and a full factorial was conducted. From the DOE model, the optimal factors were chosen to produce acceptable varistor cores at the fastest possible rate...|$|R
