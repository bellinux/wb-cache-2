5|$|The Pandavas {{complete}} 12 {{years of}} forest {{life as a}} part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per the rule, in the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> employment in the king's palace.|$|E

25|$|Human cells exhibit {{three kinds}} of motion: {{collective}} motility, mesenchymal-type movement, and amoeboid movement. Cancer cells often opportunistically switch between different kinds of motion. Some cancer researchers <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> treatments that can stop or at least slow down the spread of cancer by somehow blocking some necessary step {{in one or more}} kinds of motion.|$|E
25|$|The {{organizers}} {{envisioned a}} society which would help interested scholars {{make contact with}} one another to exchange in academic discourse. The group would additionally publish information about research in progress, it was hoped, as well as aid {{in the search for}} obscure sources — no simple task in the days before easily searchable library catalogs via the internet. Further, organizers sought a place to where one might take esoteric questions about little-known aspects of American communism and <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an answer.|$|E

25|$|Using SAM’s mass spectrometer, {{scientists}} measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that {{cosmic rays}} produce {{as they go}} through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a site {{tens of millions of}} years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop.|$|E
25|$|Provost Marschalck {{refused to}} deliver the convent's archive, which Henrich Moller in Hamburg held in pledge for an earlier credit to the convent. What {{happened}} to the archive is unclear, the credit was obviously never repaid so the archive was never restituted. Marschalck pleaded the Restitution Commission to have mercy on the conventuals who on their entry into the convent had bestowed estates or revenues on it and were without any means if expelled. With the prince-archbishopric plundered and suffering from occupation the conventuals could not <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any other refuge. However, the Restitution Commission refused.|$|E

Pegasus also aids the Sailor Soldiers by upgrading them to permanent Super forms and lending his power when summoned by Chibiusa. The new powers are used to combat the Dead Moon Circus, a mysterious circus troupe that targets humans with beautiful dreams. By looking into their Dream Mirrors, they <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the dream in which Pegasus is hiding, believing Pegasus possesses the Golden Crystal. With this crystal, the Dead Moon Circus's ruler — Queen Nehelenia — can be freed from the mirror she was sealed in.|$|E

25|$|Such {{evidence}} {{does not constitute}} proof. For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number n for which the Mertens function M(n) equals or exceeds the square root of n) is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number {{that does not have}} this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59×1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3×1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a googol), there is no <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search.|$|E

Traditional music is often found at high-class hotels, including Wayang and Gamelan performances. Javanese Wayang Orang performances {{can be found at}} Wayang Orang Bharata theatre near Senen bus terminal. As the country's largest city and capital, Jakarta has lured much national and regional talent who <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a greater audience and more opportunities for success.|$|E
25|$|This Jataka {{version is}} {{depicted}} in the Ajanta cave paintings of India (Simhala Avadana in Cave XVII). In this version, the prince who comes to the island is a merchant prince named Sinhala, who {{is the son of}} Sinha ("lion"). He and his 500 followers sail for the Ratnadeepa island, where they <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> gems in the Sirisavatthu city. They get shipwrecked, but are saved by the Yakkhinis, who prey on the shipwrecked merchants. The Yakkhinis pretend to be the widows of the merchants who earlier visited the island. Sinhala marries the chief Yakkhini, but then discovers their true identity. He and 250 of his men escape from the island on a magical flying horse (Valahassa). The chief Yakkhini follows them to his paternal kingdom, and presents herself to his father Simha, as a woman wronged by the prince. Simha gives her shelter, but she devours him {{and the rest of his}} family, except the prince. She then returns to Ratnadeepa, where she devours the remaining 250 of Sinhala's followers. Sinhala succeeds his father as the king, and leads a military expedition to Ratnadeepa. He defeats the Yakkhinis, and establishes the kingdom of the Sinhalese.|$|E

500|$|In 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore {{began the}} Irish Literary Theatre to hold Irish and Celtic plays. The {{ideals of the}} Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the [...] "ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager à l'anglais." [...] The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, [...] "We <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative {{audience}} trained to listen by its passion for oratory... & that freedom to experiment which is {{not found in the}} theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{appropriate}} {{child care for}} my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described {{to me as a}} technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement that her husband had handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E

Kenneth stops by and informs Jenna that actress Mischa Barton is on the phone and wants to speak with her. Jenna, however, tells Kenneth to tell Barton that the deal is off as she has decided to go country.
