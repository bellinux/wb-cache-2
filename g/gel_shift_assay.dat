This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule {{is involved in the}} binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension, and promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin [...] and Fried and Crothers.|$|E

It is localized between the A and B boxes of RNA polymerase III promotor and is the same as that reported for the Alu-binding protein from human spermatozoids. The same short binding site, the similarity of the isolation procedure from germ and somatic cells, and similar binding properties and molecular masses suggest homology of the two proteins.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{the identification of}} a host factor (EIIA-EF) specific for an upstream transcriptional control sequence (- 82 to - 66) of the EIA-inducible adenovirus EIIA early promoter. The levels of this factor remained unchanged after virus infection of human cells. Another study also identified a factor (EIIF) specific for this same promoter, but the activity of this second factor was shown to increase severalfold after virus infection. We now show that these dramatically different results, both based on <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> on the same promoter, {{may be explained by}} variations in protocol details and actually identify two distinct factors. When synthetic DNA copolymers [poly(dI). poly(dC) or poly(dI-dC). poly(dI-dC) ] are used as competitors in <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays,</b> a factor specific for DNA sequences between - 82 and - 66 can be identified, whereas when natural eukaryotic DNAs (salmon sperm or calf thymus) are used as competitors a different factor specific for DNA sequences between - 69 and - 33 can be identified. We have mapped the DNA-protein contact residues for the EIIF by analyzing a series of linker scan mutants in <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> and methylation interference experiments. The EIIA-EF and EIIF bind to two distinct but adjacent sequences. Competition experiments indicate that these two activities are due to two different factors.

One such binding site, located from − 119 to − 106 bp upstream from the mouse POMC gene transcription initiation site, which exhibited a close homology to the aetivator protein- 2 (AP- 2) site [1]. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing this site was subsequently used in <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> to demonstrate AP- 2 consensus sequence binding activity in extracts of AtT- 20 cell nuclei. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> competition experiments using both homologous and heterologous competitor DNA sequences revealed that the AP- 2 like factor(s) exhibited specific binding to the mouse AP- 2 consensus sequence. Furthermore, AP- 2 factor binding was also modulated by a CTF/NFl-like factor. Pretreatment of AtT- 20 cell nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase prior to inclusion in <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> led {{to a reduction in}} the intensities of AP- 2 factor-specific bands, indicating a potential involvement of protein phosphorylation in AP- 2 factor binding in AtT- 20 cells...|$|R

On approximately 265 base pair fragments, the cyclic AMP receptor protein of Escherichia coli (CRP) produces larger mobility shifts than does 434 repressor. This indicates that the 434 proteins bend DNA to a much smaller extent than does CRP. The effects of central operator sequence on intrinsic and 434 protein-induced DNA bending was also examined by <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay.</b> Two 434 operators having different central sequences and affinities for 434 proteins display no static bending. The amount of gel shift induced by 434 repressor on these operators is identical, showing that the 434 repressor bends operators with different central sequences to the same extent. Hence, mutations in the central region of the operator do not influence the bent structure of the unbound or bound operator...|$|E

40|$|The C-terminal {{domain of}} the α subunit (αCTD) of Escherichia coli RNA {{polymerase}} is often involved in transcriptional regulation. The αCTD typically stimulates transcription via interactions with promoter UP element DNA and transcriptional activators. DNase I footprinting and <b>gel</b> mobility <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> were used to look for potential interaction of the αCTD with the phage Mu middle promoter Pm and its activator protein Mor. Binding of RNA polymerase to Pm {{in the presence of}} Mor resulted in production of a DNase I footprint downstream of Mor due to open complex formation and generation of a second footprint just upstream of the Mor binding site. Generation of the upstream footprint did not require open complex formation and also occurred in reactions in which the αCTD or His-α proteins were substituted for RNA polymerase. In <b>gel</b> mobility <b>shift</b> <b>assays,</b> the formation of a supershifted ternary complex demonstrated that Mor and His-α bind synergistically to Pm DNA. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> with short DNA fragments demonstrated that only the Mor binding site and a single upstream αCTD binding site were required for ternary complex formation.

These {{data suggest that}} in cholestasis where liver tissue bile acid concentrations are increased, NF-κB should be activated and inhibition of NF-κB should potentiate liver injury. Our aims were to test these two predictions. Cholestasis was obtained by common bile duct ligation in mice. NF-κB activation was demonstrated in nuclear extracts by the electrophoretic mobility <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay</b> from 3 -day bile duct-ligated (BDL) mice but not in controls. Immunohistochemistry for NF-κB demonstrated nuclear localization in hepatocytes of BDL mice consistent with its activation in this liver cell type. Electrophoretic mobility <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay</b> and immunohistochemistry for NF-κB in BDL tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 knockout mice demonstrated hepatocyte NF-κB activation, suggesting that tumor necrosis factor-α was {{not responsible for the}} activation of this transcription factor. Liver injury was assessed in BDL mice after administration of the adenovirus 5 inhibitor of kappa B superrepressor (Ad 5 IκBsr) to inhibit NF-κB. TUNEL-positive cells and serum alanine aminotransferase values were increased at least threefold in mice treated with the Ad 5 IκBsr versus the empty virus.

40|$|The avian {{leukosis}} virus (ALV) {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) contains a compact transcription enhancer that is active in many cell types. A major feature of the enhancer is multiple CCAAT/enhancer element motifs that could be important for the strong transcriptional activity of this unit. The contributions of the three CCAAT/enhancer elements to LTR function were examined in B cells, as this cell type is targeted for ALV tumor induction following integration of LTR sequences next to the c-myc proto-oncogene. One CCAAT/enhancer element, termed a 3, {{was found to be}} the most critical for LTR enhancement in transiently transfected B lymphoma cells, while in chicken embryo fibroblasts all three elements contributed equally to enhancement. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrated that vitellogenin gene-binding protein (VBP), a member of the PAR subfamily of C/EBP factors, is a major component of the nuclear proteins binding to the a 3 CCAAT/enhancer element. VBP activated transcription through the a 3 CCAAT/enhancer element, supporting the idea that VBP is important for LTR enhancement in B cells. A member of the Rel family of proteins was also identified as a component of the a 3 protein binding complex in B cells. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> and immunoprecipitation <b>assays</b> indicated that this factor is RelA. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrated that while RelA does not bind directly to the LTR CCAAT/enhancer elements, it does interact with VBP to potentiate VBP DNA binding activity.

Results of the mutagenic analysis indicated that the CAR 1 URS was a 9 -base-pair palindromic sequence, 5 '-AGCCGCCGA- 3 '. A DNA fragment containing this sequence was shown to bind one or more proteins by a <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay.</b> DNA fragments containing point mutations that completely eliminated URS function were not effective competitors in this assay, whereas those which supported URS function were effective competitors.

These sequences were shown to support varying degrees of URS function in the expression vector assay, to bind protein as demonstrated by the <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay,</b> and to compete with a DNA fragment containing the CAR 1 URS for protein binding. These results indicate that the CAR 1 URS element possesses the characteristics of a repressor binding site. Further, they are consistent with the suggestion that sites homologous to the CAR 1 URS may be situated in the 5 '-flanking regions of multiple unrelated yeast genes.

In this study, we used a <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay</b> to demonstrate that the inducer, cis,cis-muconate, increases the affinity of CatR for the catBC promoter region by 20 -fold. Furthermore, in the absence of cis,cis-muconate, CatR forms two complexes in the <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay.</b> The inducer cis,cis-muconate confers specificity primarily for the formation of complex 2. DNase I footprinting showed that an additional 27 bp of the catBC promoter region is protected by CatR in the presence of cis,cis-muconate. We have named this second binding site the activation binding site. Methylation interference footprinting determined that in the presence or absence of inducer, five G nucleotides of the catBC promoter region were necessary for CatR interaction with the repression binding site, while a single G residue was important for CatR interaction with the activation binding site in the presence of cis,cis-muconate. Using polymerase chain reaction-generated constructs, we found that the binding of CatR to the repression binding site is independent of the activation binding site.

40|$|Activation of HSF and {{selective}} increase in heat-shock pro-teins by acute dexamethasone treatment. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 278 : H 1091 –H 1097, 2000. —Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) {{are an important}} family of endogenous protective proteins, which increase in response to myocardial ischemia and other stresses. Overexpression of HSP 72 is cardioprotective. We {{were interested in the}} regulation of heat-shock factor (HSF), the transcription factor for HSP genes. Previously we have observed that the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a increases HSP 72 levels and postulated that dexamethasone might effect the heat shock response. In the adult rat cardiac myocyte we found that treatment with either low (10 µM) - or high (100 µM) -dose dexamethasone activated HSF by 2 – 6 h as determined by <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assay</b> without evidence of cytotoxicity. Although HS...|$|E
40|$|The {{protein product}} of the CHI 3 L 1 gene, human {{cartilage}} 39 -kDa glycoprotein (HC-gp 39), is a tissue-restricted, chitin-binding lectin and member of glycosyl hydrolase family 18. In contrast to many other monocyte/macrophage markers, its expression is absent in monocytes and strongly induced during late stages of human macrophage differentiation. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its cell type-restricted and maturation-associated expression in macrophages, we initiated a detailed study of the proximal HC-gp 39 promoter. Deletion analysis of reporter constructs in macrophage-like THP- 1 cells localized a region directing high levels of macrophage-specific reporter gene expression to approximately 300 bp adjacent to the major transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence contained consensus binding sites for several known factors, and specific binding of nuclear PU. 1, Sp 1, Sp 3, USF, AML- 1, and C/EBP proteins was detectable in <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays.</b> In vivo footprinting assays with dimethyl sulfate demonstrate that the protection of corresponding sequences was enhanced in macrophages compared with monocytes. Mutational analysis of transcription factor binding sites indicated a predominant role for a single Sp 1 binding site in regulating HC-gp 39 promoter activity. In addition, <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> using nuclear extracts of monocytes and macrophages demonstrated that the binding of nuclear Sp 1, but not Sp 3, markedly increases during macrophage differentiation. Our results further highlight {{the important role of}} Sp 1 in macrophage gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus is controlled by global regulatory loci, including two-component regulatory systems and transcriptional regulators (e. g., sar family genes). Most members of the SarA family have been partially characterized and shown to regulate a large numbers of target genes. Here, we describe the characterization of sarZ, a sarA paralog from S. aureus, and its regulatory relationship {{with other members of}} its family. Expression of sarZ was growth phase dependent with maximal expression in the early exponential phase of growth. Transcription of sarZ was reduced in an mgrA mutant and returned to a normal level in a complemented mgrA mutant strain, which suggests that mgrA acts as an activator of sarZ transcription. Purified MgrA protein bound to the sarZ promoter region, as determined by <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays.</b> Among the sarA family of genes analyzed, inactivation of sarZ increased sarS transcription, while it decreased agr transcription. The {{expression of}} potential target genes involved in virulence was evaluated in single and double mutants of sarZ with mgrA, sarX, and agr. Northern and zymogram analyses indicated that the sarZ gene product played a role in regulating several virulence genes, particularly those encoding exoproteins. <b>Gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrated nonspecific binding of purified SarZ protein to the promoter regions of the sarZ-regulated target genes. These results demonstrate the important role played by SarZ in controlling regulatory and virulence gene expression in S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} the regulatory mechanisms of human angiotensinogen (ANG) gene {{expression in the}} brain, we analyzed the 1. 3 -kb promoter by transfection studies and <b>gel</b> <b>shift</b> <b>assays.</b> The region from − 106 to + 44 was sufficient for promoter activity in glioblastoma cells, and multiple nuclear factors including AGCF 2 (human 				 					 						A 						 					 				N 				 					 						G 						 					 				 				 					 						c 						 					 				ore promoter binding 				 					 						f 						 					 				actor 				 					 						 2 						 					 				) bound within this 150 -bp region. The mutations within AGCF 2 -binding elements decreased the transcriptional activity in glioblastoma cells but rather increased it in hepatoma cells. These results indicate that AGCF 2 has a differential function between these cells and contributes to the glia-dependent angiotensinogen promoter activity...|$|R
