5|$|Matangi is also {{associated}} with forests and tribal peoples, who lie outside conventional Hindu society. Her thousand-name hymn from the Nanayavarta-tantra mentions lines that describe her as dwelling in, walking <b>in,</b> <b>knowing</b> and relishing the forest.|$|E
5|$|I {{hope that}} {{all the people who}} see us will be happy <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> that we, despite being prisoners, {{we were able to do}} this. Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy. As for the judges, they may be impressed with us, seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case. We are being rehabilitated in a good way.|$|E
5|$|In early times, {{astronomy}} only {{comprised the}} observation and {{predictions of the}} motions of objects {{visible to the naked}} eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially interested <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|When I break My Silence, {{the impact}} of My Love will be {{universal}} and all life in creation will know, feel and receive of it. It will help every individual to break himself free from his own bondage in his own way. I am the Divine Beloved who loves you {{more than you can}} ever love yourself. The breaking of My Silence will help you to help yourself <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> your real Self.|$|E

25|$|Jaffe et al. {{discovered}} that O. bauri uses a volatile substance, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), {{in order to}} recognize one another. The trick <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> one’s relative is {{by the amount of}} substance produced upon antennation. Further analysis using gas chromatography was used to determine that each trap jaw ant from a different colony have different amounts of volatile chemicals within its system.|$|E
25|$|My {{father was}} heartbroken, and I saw him {{physically}} and mentally broken by the ordeal. He fought back {{with the help of}} my mother and recovered his strength, confidence, and pride before he {{died of a heart attack}} five years later. In the end, I think he found comfort <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> that what he did saved some airmen's lives, and that was worth more to him than four stars.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} for Web crawlers to identify themselves so that Web site administrators can contact the owner if needed. In some cases, crawlers may be accidentally trapped in a crawler trap {{or they may be}} overloading a Web server with requests, and the owner needs to stop the crawler. Identification is also useful for administrators that are interested <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> when they may expect their Web pages to be indexed by a particular search engine.|$|E
25|$|In the Catholic tradition, saints beside Ignatius of Loyola have {{suggested}} prayer and contemplation on scripture as {{a path to}} knowing Christ better. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how {{to try to get}} to know Christ by using mental prayer. While the Catholic Church supports Christian meditation as beneficial <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> Christ, in the letter Aspects of Christian meditation it specifically warned against using non-Christian (e.g. modified Buddhist) styles of meditations as an attempt to know Christ.|$|E
25|$|Schachter-Shalomi {{was among}} the group of rabbis, {{from a wide range}} of Jewish denominations, who {{traveled}} together to India to meet with the Dalai Lama and discuss diaspora survival for Jews and Tibetan Buddhists with him. Tibetans, exiled from their homeland for more than three generations, face some of the same assimilation challenges experienced by Jewish diaspora. The Dalai Lama was interested <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how the Jews had survived with their culture intact. That journey was chronicled in Rodger Kamenetz' 1994 book The Jew in the Lotus.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are interested <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, opponents are skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important strategic moves and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the design}} {{appears as a}} {{comfortable}} dwelling complete with loggia and conservatory. A lesser architect {{might not have been}} able to resist the addition of a small turret or pinnacle. Petre's ingenuity lay <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how to mix large windows and more comfortable features with the medieval, and then ascertaining the exact moment to halt the Gothic theme before it became a pastiche of the original. In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> {{what to say}} in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of both}} symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E
50|$|Knowing-how. Knowing-how is {{the ability}} to use a set of {{procedures}} to achieve an intended result. A teacher, for example, starts class by having the children line up outside the classroom, enter the classroom in single file and take their seats as assigned seats. The teacher has learned that this set of procedures achieves an orderly entry into the room and focuses the attention of pupils upon what is to happen next in the lesson. In this example, this teacher is manifesting knowing-how. When the teacher is giving directions, the knowing-how is being manifested as linguistic knowing-how. It can be manifested in gestures and body language (physical <b>knowing),</b> <b>in</b> feelings (emotional <b>knowing),</b> <b>in</b> anticipation (imaginal <b>knowing).</b> Knowing-how is the basis for effective action within the educational process.|$|R

Brolin was {{released}} after posting a cash bond of $334. Brolin said to a reporter, [...] "It was nice to be <b>in</b> jail <b>knowing</b> that I hadn’t done anything wrong. And it was maddening to be <b>in</b> jail <b>knowing</b> that I hadn’t done anything wrong." [...] Charges against all seven men were later dropped by Shreveport prosecutors.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.|$|E
25|$|Hankey (letter to McKenna 15 August 1911) {{complained of}} Wilson’s “perfect {{obsession}} for military operations on the Continent”, scoffing at his bicycling trips and {{accusing him of}} filling the War Office with like-minded officers. At Nicholson’s request Wilson prepared a paper (dated 15 August), based {{on the evolution of}} his ideas over the previous ten years. He argued that British aid would be necessary to prevent Germany defeating France and achieving domination of the continent, and that this would have both a moral and a military effect on the outcome. He argued that by Day 13 of mobilisation France would have the upper hand, outnumbering the Germans by 63 divisions to 57 along the frontier, but by Day 17 Germany would outnumber France by 96 divisions to 66. However, because of road bottlenecks in the passable parts of the war theatre, the Germans would at most be able to deploy 54 divisions in the opening phase, allowing the 6 infantry divisions of the BEF a disproportionate effect on the outcome. Ernest May (<b>in</b> <b>Knowing</b> One’s Enemies: Intelligence Assessments Between the Two World Wars 1984) later claimed that Wilson had “cooked” these figures, but his arguments were challenged by Edward Bennett, who argued that Wilson’s numbers were not far wrong (Journal of Modern History, June 1988).|$|E
500|$|The Upanishad {{states that}} {{knowledge}} of Brahman results <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> spiritual {{truth in the}} Paroksha (indirect cognition) way, but Sakshatkara (direct realization) results <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> that his own soul is Brahman. And when a practitioner of Yoga becomes a Jivamukta (liberated soul), he knows that his Atman is the ultimate perfection. To an enlightened person who has realized Brahman, the two words [...] "bondage" [...] and [...] "moksha" [...] mean [...] "mine" [...] and [...] "not mine". [...] "Mine" [...] is linked to a person, but [...] "not mine" [...] relates to one who is liberated from all thinking and knows Atman.|$|E
