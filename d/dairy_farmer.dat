Educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in Sydney, Brown started playing cricket as a wicket-keeper, before changing his focus to opening the batting. He left high school after two years, but was unable to find regular full-time work amid the Great Depression.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study whether <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> involved in horizontal arrangements (HA) have lower information asymmetry {{than those who do}} not participate in HA. Our assumption is that greater access to information results in fewer risky decisions in production systems. One hundred and twenty semi-structured questionnaires were applied to <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> located in four different geographical regions in Paraná State, Brazil. Exploratory factor analysis was used to define factors related to information asymmetry in dairy agribusiness system (DAS) and four factors were defined. In a second step, the 120 <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> were split into two groups: the first one involved in HA and the second one not involved in HA. Mean test (t-student) were performed to compare these groups between factors. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) were observed for factors related to transaction information and for general market information, and <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> participating in HA achieved the greatest values. Finally, it can be concluded that <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> who participate in HA have higher access to information, which can create an environment with lower information asymmetry and, consequently, be subject to lower risks than <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> who do not participate in H...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{farming is}} {{becoming}} an important livelihood support activity in the semi-arid regions of Kenya. However, it is becoming clear that the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> are challenged and in the recent past, milk production has not kept up with the demand. This {{has been linked to}} poor adaptations and innovativeness of the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> in these regions. In endeavours to offer solutions and help the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> improve their production and become resilient, different stakeholders have advocated for adoption of milk and forage production-enhancing innovations by the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers.</b> This study sought to establish the kind of innovations and adaptive measures carried out by the peri-urban <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> in south eastern Kenya to improve their milk production and their significance to milk production. A sample of 150 farmers from the peri-urban environs of Wote and Machakos towns was used. A semi-structured questionnaire was used and data analysized using descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings show that adoption of dairy technology, Artificial Insemination (AI), fodder crops and crop residue, Tumbukiza Method, stall-feeding, feedstuff chopping, water harvesting, hay barn technology, hay and silage making significantly improved milk production at p< 0. 05. Co-operative concept had insignificant influence on milk production. It is recommended that the <b>dairy</b> <b>farmers</b> continue to adopt the production-enhancing, forage production-enhancing and forage utilization-enhancing innovations.

25|$|This {{method of}} {{insemination}} quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous {{to keep on}} the average dairy facility. AI also {{makes it possible to}} speed the genetic improvement of the dairy herd because every <b>dairy</b> <b>farmer</b> has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI does require more intensive reproductive management of the herd as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly inseminate a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.|$|E
