Developmental <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals.

40|$|Identifying <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> protein {{terms is}} {{important}} for obtaining biological knowledge from literature. We have developed GPmarkup (for <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> proteinname mark up), a system that automatically identifies <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> protein terms <b>and</b> maps <b>gene</b> <b>and</b> protein symbols (e. g., DR 3) to names (e. g., Death Receptor 3) in MEDLINE abstracts...|$|R

A multistep curation process and inclusion of different biomedical dictionaries in the curation process leads to an increase of precision and recall. The recognition of names containing special parenthesis expressions augments the recall further.

5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000â€“25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E
5|$|Between 1979 and 1981, it was {{estimated}} that Mups are encoded by a gene family of between 15 and 35 <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> pseudogenes in the mouse and by an estimated 20 genes in the rat. In 2008 a more precise number of Mup genes in a range of species was determined by analyzing the DNA sequence of whole genomes.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatics is a {{field of}} study that {{includes}} the creation and advancement of databases, and computational and statistical techniques, {{that can be used}} in studies of the human brain, particularly in the areas of gene and protein expression. Bioinformatics and studies in genomics, and functional genomics, generated the need for DNA annotation, a transcriptome technology, identifying <b>genes,</b> <b>and</b> their and location and function. GeneCards is a major database.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within <b>genes,</b> <b>and</b> the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical Diagnostics. Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical Diagnostics in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some <b>genes</b> <b>and</b> inhibition of others.|$|E

Frog and the ranch hands arrive and stampede their cattle through the town. After a street brawl, Blaine's men are arrested and taken away. Afterwards, <b>Gene</b> <b>and</b> Taffy join their friends at a picnic celebrating Tom's twenty-first birthday.|$|R

5|$|From 1988 onwards {{analyses}} {{based on}} molecular phylogeny, which compares biochemical {{features such as}} similarities in DNA, have placed brachiopods among the Lophotrochozoa, a protostome super-phylum that includes molluscs, annelids and flatworms but excludes the other protostome super-phylum Ecdysozoa, whose members include arthropods.

5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs.

It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly.

Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
