500|$|Coolidge {{adopted the}} {{taxation}} policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, {{the idea that}} [...] "scientific taxation", lower taxes, increase rather than decrease <b>government</b> <b>receipts.</b> Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. In addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt. Coolidge's ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people. They reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid any federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired in total. State and local governments saw considerable growth, however, surpassing the federal budget in 1927.|$|E

The result revealed that high variation of shocks in real federal debt is explained by their own innovations in the short run, by CPI followed by real federal debt its self.

In medium term, only real federal <b>government</b> tax <b>receipts</b> are negative while the others are positive.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two policy {{approaches}} {{to address the}} problem of the ?pensions time bomb? by influencing private-sector pension provision. In assessing the role of private-sector pensions, it is common to concentrate exclusively on the issue of whether early retirement penalties or late retirement benefits are actuarially fair. We argue that this focus is unbalanced since private-sector pension arrangements have significant implications for governments' finances. When private pensions encourage early retirement, they reduce the number of people paying taxes and increase the number of people supplementing their private pensions through various forms of public support. To induce private-sector pension providers to internalize this externality, we examine two policy responses: taxing private pension receipts of early retirees, and issuing ?early retirement rights. ? The <b>government?s</b> <b>receipts</b> from the pension taxes or the sale of early retirement rights are used, in part, to provide employment vouchers for people of pensionable age...|$|R
