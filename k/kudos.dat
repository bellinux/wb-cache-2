5|$|In episode five, Tim Pigott-Smith plays Hampton Wilder, a {{character}} who was based on Richard Nixon and Jeffrey Archer. In the same episode, Naoko Mori appeared as a lover of Danny's; Mori previously appeared in Psychos, another series produced by <b>Kudos.</b> In the finale, Irish actor Lorcan Cranitch plays Irish splinter group terrorist Patrick McCann. Cranitch had previously appeared in several other dramas as Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) operators.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (<b>kudos).</b> He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham {{moved on}} to other projects. In the 1760s, he was {{approached}} by his most illustrious patron, the Duke of York (brother of King George III), to design one of the greatest mansions in Pall Mall, namely York House. The rectangular mansion that Brettingham designed was built in the Palladian style on two principal floors, with the state rooms as at Norfolk House, arranged in a circuit around the central staircase hall. The house was a mere pastiche of Norfolk House, but for Brettingham it had the <b>kudos</b> of a royal occupant.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Spooks was {{produced}} by <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television for the BBC. Much of the production crew from the first two series returned. New crew members were brought in with the requirement that they were fans of the series and have ambition, {{so that they can}} understand Spooks. Andrew Woodhead was the series producer, with Jane Featherstone, Simon Crawford Collins and Gareth Neame as executive producers. Collins, who was the producer for the first two series, had to step back to executive producer, as he was overcommitted producing <b>Kudos</b> crime series Hustle. Woodhead replaced him as he was accustomed to the show, but also added more vitality to the show. Christopher Aird was the assistant producer. The third series included five writers. Howard Brenton wrote the first, second and eighth episodes. Rupert Walters wrote the third and ninth episodes. Ben Richards wrote the fourth, sixth and tenth episodes. Richards previously wrote the ninth episode of series two, and accepted the offer to return. His script in the second series was his first script for television; he found writing easier as time went by. Raymond Khoury wrote the seventh episode. Series creator David Wolstencroft wrote the fifth episode. Wolstencroft was poised to write the next episode, but found himself committed to other projects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kudos</b> Film and Television {{developed}} Spooks after releasing Channel 4 medical drama Psychos in 1999, {{though the}} company initially faced friction from television networks which saw no potential in a post-Cold War spy show. The producers later successfully pitched the series to the BBC after the networks' commissioning teams were replaced. Four episodes were being written when the September 11 attacks took place, and the some scenes were rewritten to take the event into account to show the audience Spooks's goal of fighting terrorism. Throughout production, the producers were advised by former intelligence officers from the Security Service, KGB and Central Intelligence Agency. Filming took place from November 2001 to March 2002.|$|E
25|$|For {{many groups}} at the Fringe, the {{ultimate}} goal is a favourable review—which, apart from the welcome <b>kudos,</b> may help minimise financial losses from putting on the show.|$|E
25|$|Broadchurch {{was created}} and written by Chibnall, and {{produced}} by <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television {{in association with}} Shine America and Imaginary Friends. Chibnall served as executive producer along with Kudos' Jane Featherstone, while Richard Stokes was producer.|$|E

25|$|<b>Kudos</b> and the BBC {{announced}} {{in a joint}} statement in August 2011 that Series 10 {{would be the last}} series. It began airing on BBC One on Sunday 18 September 2011 at 9:00pm, moving from its traditional weekday evening slot, with the final episode airing on 23 October 2011.|$|E
25|$|Life on Mars is an American {{science fiction}} crime drama {{television}} series which originally aired on ABC from October 9, 2008 to April 1, 2009.

The series was co-produced by <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television, 20th Century Fox Television, and ABC Studios.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 2011, Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie, the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very {{enthusiastic}} about the proposal. Just {{a few days after}} she finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall contact <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television, a production company. Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham. Broadchurch was green-lit by Fincham almost immediately for airing in early 2013.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 2011, Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie, the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very {{enthusiastic}} about the proposal. Just days after she finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall work with <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television, a well-known production company. <b>Kudos</b> immediately agreed to produce the series. Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham, who green-lit the project almost immediately. ITV wanted the series to air in early 2013, which meant that filming had {{to occur in the}} summer of 2012. That gave Broadchurch a much shorter pre-production schedule that usual. ITV wanted a high-quality series despite the time constraint. According to Chibnall, ITV advised him to make the series as bold as possible and to ignore commercial considerations. Fincham and Chibnall discussed stripping Broadchurch over a series of four or five nights, rather than as a weekly program. But both men rejected the idea. Fincham was keen to allow speculation to build over time, and to give viewers a chance to engage in conversation about each episode before the next one aired.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} {{was created}} by writer David Wolstencroft, and produced by <b>Kudos</b> for the BBC. A trademark style, coupled with the series' popularity, attracted {{a large number of}} high-profile guest stars. These included Martine McCutcheon, Hugh Laurie, Robert Hardy, Tim McInnerny, Bruce Payne, Reece Dinsdale, Ian McDiarmid, Ewen Bremner, Jimi Mistry, Andy Serkis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin McNally, Rupert Graves, Andrew Tiernan, Anton Lesser, Anupam Kher, Alexander Siddig, and Anthony Head.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} left Liberace so shaken that he largely {{abandoned his}} movie aspirations. He made two more big-screen appearances, {{but only in}} cameo roles. These were When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965), starring Connie Francis, where Liberace essentially played himself. He received <b>kudos</b> for his brief appearance as a casket salesman in The Loved One (1966), based on Evelyn Waugh's satire of the funeral business and movie industry in Southern California.|$|E
25|$|Like the {{majority}} of alto players of his generation, Harriott was deeply influenced by Charlie Parker. He developed a style that fused Parker with his own Jamaican musical sensibility - most notably the mento and calypso music he grew up with. Even in his later experiments, his roots were always audible. However, it was Harriott's mastery of bebop that gained him immediate <b>kudos</b> within the British jazz scene upon his arrival in London in 1951.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} filmed on Super 16, {{rather than the}} more {{commonly}} used digital alternatives. Episodes were originally aired with no credits on BBC One, a choice made to maintain an atmosphere of the anonymity of real-life spies and the drama of each episode. Prior to Series 9, the subsequent episode was aired on BBC Three one week ahead of its BBC One showing (the first and last episode were only shown on BBC One). BBC Three airings included a brief credit sequence following the trailer and before the <b>Kudos</b> and BBC logos.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Hutchison {{initiated}} a reorganisation of British Anti-Aircraft Command, which {{reduced the number}} of heavy anti-aircraft units, and transferred some Territorial Army anti-aircraft units to the field force. He left office in October 1954, succeeded by fellow Scottish military officer Fitzroy Maclean. After his return to the backbenches, Hutchison resumed making partisan speeches; in December 1954 he attacked Labour MPs for politicising military subjects in order to seek political <b>kudos.</b> In March 1955, after a report about the activities of some British Communists in Korea, he urged their prosecution for treason.|$|E
25|$|Broadchurch is a British {{television}} crime drama {{broadcast on}} ITV. It was created and written by Chris Chibnall and produced by <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television, Shine America, and Imaginary Friends. The first series, which premiered on 4 March 2013, {{focused on the}} death of an 11-year-old boy and the impact of grief, mutual suspicion and media attention on the town. Filming for series two began in late May 2014 and concluded on 12 October 2014 and the series premiered on 5 January 2015. Series three was confirmed on 23 February 2015, immediately following the series two finale, and premiered on 27 February 2017.|$|E
25|$|Hustle {{was largely}} born {{from the same}} {{production}} team that created and popularised the early series of Spooks, a similarly-styled drama series first broadcast in 2002. Bharat Nalluri, that series' Executive Director, conceived the idea in early 2002 while filming for the first Spooks series was ongoing. Nalluri pitched the concept to Jane Featherstone, Managing Director of <b>Kudos</b> Film & Television which was the production company behind Spooks, {{in the back of}} a taxi while returning from a day's filming. Intrigued by the idea, Featherstone recruited Tony Jordan, the lead scriptwriter of the soap opera EastEnders, to develop it into a workable proposal.|$|E
25|$|But {{for all of}} its {{editorial}} <b>kudos</b> under Maynard, the Tribune {{still was}} plagued by financial difficulties beyond Maynard's control. Facing a debt of $31.5 million and on the brink of folding in August 1991, the Tribune was saved by the Freedom Forum, Allen H. Neuharth's media foundation. The Freedom Forum paid Gannett $2.5 million, retired the Tribunes debt and gave Maynard $5 million in operating funds. But the rescue proved to be short-lived, and the continuing financial pressures—combined with the disclosure in July 1992 that Robert Maynard had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer—forced the Maynards to put the Tribune up for sale.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, Rainer {{mainly focused}} on anthropological {{work and the}} popularization of anthropological science. Alongside sociologists such as Dimitrie Gusti, Henri H. Stahl, Sabin Manuilă, Mircea Vulcănescu and Xenia Costa-Foru, he was present on the {{teaching}} staff of Veturia Manuilă's private school, where he gave lectures in anatomy to all-female classes preparing {{for a career in}} social services. Between 1928 and 1932, Rainer was also involved in Gusti's rural sociology project in the Carpathians. Joining the Gusti team as an anthropometrist, he earned <b>kudos</b> from the scientific community of his day with Enquêtes anthropologiques dans trois villages roumains des Carpathes ("Anthropological Queries in Three Romanian Villages of the Carpathians"). Published in 1937, it remains one of just four testimonials written by members of Gusti's team.|$|E
25|$|Lecca's new {{missions}} did not alienate {{him from}} the German circles, and he witnessed first-hand the Germans' growing involvement in Romania's antisemitic policies. He {{was caught in the}} middle as Horst Böhme, who headed the RSHA branch in Bucharest, began investigating Killinger's bureaucratic work. This was a local facet of the violent conflict opposing the RSHA and the German Foreign Office. Böhme, who wanted to speed up the Final Solution project, was described by Lecca as a person of outstanding cruelty, promoted as <b>kudos</b> for his earlier rule of terror in Bohemia-Moravia. Lecca alleged that both Killinger and the senior Schutzstaffel delegate, Richter, were alarmed by Böhme's scrutiny of their dealings with the CE. He writes that Böhme accused both colleagues for leniency and incompetence, displaying such arrogance as to invite in speculation that he was mentally ill. In one of his own RSHA reports, Böhme worried that Killinger had lost Antonescu's respect, and that, among Romanians, Lecca was the only one still interested in what the German Ambassador had to say. Eventually, Böhme's notes angered the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who obtained his reassignment, freeing Killinger of a nuisance.|$|E
500|$|<b>Kudos</b> {{began to}} develop the show after {{producing}} the Channel 4 medical drama series Psychos in 1999. <b>Kudos</b> wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical [...] "precinct-based dramas" [...] (crime and medical). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across John le Carré novels at a Waterstone's bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt {{the benefit of a}} spy show is that rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work home with them, spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their loved ones. In the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote Psychos, was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When <b>Kudos</b> contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a [...] "shitty job". <b>Kudos</b> later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as <b>Kudos,</b> as they did not see the potential of a post-Cold War spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, <b>Kudos</b> again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, commissioned the show after planning to introduce [...] "braver", [...] "dynamic" [...] and [...] "pacier" [...] shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks was {{produced}} by <b>Kudos</b> Film and Television for the BBC. David Wolstencroft was credited as the series creator, Simon Crawford Collins as the producer, and Jane Featherstone as the series producer. The executive producers of the first series were <b>Kudos</b> director Stephen Garrett and Head of Independent Drama Commissioning for the BBC, Gareth Neame. The series includes three screenwriters, and three directors. Wolstencroft wrote the first two episodes and finale of series one. Simon Mirren wrote the third episode. Howard Brenton wrote the last three episodes, co-writing the finale with Wolstencroft. The producers hired Brenton for his [...] "radical" [...] and [...] "provocative" [...] style. By {{the time he was}} hired it had been sixteen years since he last wrote for television.|$|E
500|$|Colfer as Kurt {{received}} <b>kudos</b> in most reviews. Semigran wrote, [...] "I give Chris Colfer all {{the credit}} in the world, because {{no matter what the}} material, he knocks it out of the park every time." [...] James Poniewozik of Time agreed that given the episode's material, [...] "it's important to have it {{in the hands of an}} actor as good as Chris Colfer". The scene with Kurt, Burt, Finn and Blaine was singled out by Jenna Mullins of E! Online, who observed that it [...] "quickly turned into much more than just prom ensembles. It's the jumps from quirky to heavy that make Glee special, and I love watching the cast handle so much in one scene." ...|$|E
500|$|... shows current {{releases}} and, {{in conjunction}} with the Wells Film Society shows less well known and historical films. The previous cinema, The Regal in Priory Road, closed in 1993 and is now <b>Kudos</b> Nightclub. It was built in 1935 by ES Roberts from Flemish bond brickwork with Art Deco features. It is a Grade II listed building, and was on the Buildings at Risk Register until its restoration which included the restoration and repair of the stained glass façade. Wells Little Theatre is operated by a voluntary society which started in 1902. In 1989 they took over the old boy's building of Wells Blue School, where they put on a variety of operatic and other productions.|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{announced}} {{the creation of}} HolbyBlue on 27 April 2006. The newly-proposed drama was revealed to be a police spin-off from medical drama Holby City. It was also confirmed that Tony Jordan had been recruited {{to work on the}} scripts and consider [...] "how storylines between the police station and the hospital could be intertwined for the programme." [...] Three production companies were involved in the development of HolbyBlue: BBC, <b>Kudos</b> and Red Planet Pictures. The Guardian picked up on the BBC's reverse tactic of creating a police procedural spin-off drama from a medical drama, compared to ITV, which [...] "spawned a hospital spin-off", The Royal, from original police procedural drama, Heartbeat.|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{felt that}} the key to a {{successful}} police drama was its ability to reflect the society [...] "in which it existed". Answers about what best reflected the society that people lived came from joint head of <b>Kudos,</b> Jane Featherstone, who stated that HolbyBlue would be the first British police drama to be created since the September 11 attacks. As a result, Jordan created a drama in which his characters would be forced to deal with limited resources and bureaucracy stemming from the war on terror, whilst trying to combat domestic crime. Jordan decided to imitate two American police dramas: Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue, using [...] "flawed characters, who still managed to be heroes", while also aiming to [...] "accurately reflect society".|$|E
500|$|The episode's storyline, {{including}} Helen's death, {{was meant}} to be in the first series finale. However, by then, the second episode was not yet written, and series producer <b>Kudos</b> were due to deliver the story to the BBC in one month. As a result, the episode was brought forward to the second slot. Since the first episode began Spooks [...] "with a bang", series creator and writer David Wolstencroft, was under pressure to top the efforts of the first episode with the second, but not by much. During the writing stage, he introduced a story arc involving Danny Hunter and his obsession with money and spending, apparently mirroring the writer; the arc was created for the temptations that the officers may have. In the original screenplay, Danny was to spend on his mother.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, Rush Street was {{the center}} of the Chicago nightlife as home to many great cabarets, bars, clubs and restaurants. [...] However, many of the bars {{migrated}} north to Division Street as the street gentrified. [...] Currently, the late night establishments mostly lure suburbanites and tourists. The Chicago Sun-Times describes it as the [...] "hippest strip" [...] in Chicago, with specific <b>kudos</b> to the part between Oak Street and Chicago Avenue. It continues to be the destination where visiting conventioners in pursuit of Chicago nightlife are brought by taxi as well as a preferred place for thirtysomething singles to congregate at night, especially in the summer. Although Rush Street ends two blocks south of Division Street, the nightlife ambiance now continues to Division and spreads west from there.|$|E
500|$|... "Vincent Kartheiser [...] had a {{challenging}} year playing Angel’s errant son, {{to say the}} least. While audiences may have hoped for a reconciliation between the two, it {{was never meant to}} be. Connor instead started and remained [...] as petulant and unsympathetic as many teens are in real life. [...] Cordelia completely fouled just about everyone and made him the whipping boy for fan ire. But [...] earns serious <b>kudos</b> for his amazing last inning transformation of Connor from brat to tragic figure worthy of pity and understanding in Peace Out and Home. That Vincent was able to redeem Connor {{in such a short time}} is a true feat in itself and it was singularly responsible for making the finale as heartbreaking and haunting as it ended up being." ...|$|E
500|$|Iron Rattler has {{generally}} been well received. Keith Miller of Funworld Magazine described the ride as [...] "wonderfully smooth" [...] highlighting the slow cresting of the lift hill as an [...] "enjoyable element". He concludes by stating [...] "there's not one restful moment on this ride". Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride 4.5 out of 5 stars. Levine applauded Six Flags for replacing a bad wooden roller coaster with [...] "a wonderful, remarkably smooth, thoroughly fun and enjoyable ride". He also gives <b>kudos</b> to Rocky Mountain Construction who manufactured the I-Box track and redesigned the ride. Brenda Solis of KLQB described the ride as [...] "the most intense, craziest roller coaster ever". She also compared the renovated ride to the original ride, stating [...] "the old Rattler wasn't as scary or intense or fast as the new one".|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console on June 1, 2007 in Europe and June 4, 2007 in North America. IGN felt the {{original}} game was superior, but praised the two-player cooperative mode, fluid animations and the [...] "fair number of extras that add {{a lot of}} depth". GameSpot however called the game [...] "mediocre", [...] "forgettable" [...] and [...] "not much fun", though it noted the detailed [...] "unique look" [...] and parallax scrolling. Eurogamer, which gave ToeJam and Earl's re-release a negative review, praised the departure from the predecessor's concept, saying [...] "it gets some <b>kudos</b> at least for not following the 'more of the same' game sequel mentality." [...] The reviewer praised the [...] "forward thinking" [...] environment interaction, but ultimately decided to give the game a middling score, saying [...] "for all its bold ideas, the basic platforming mechanic is pretty shonky".|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{wrote of}} Will's Broadway plans that [...] "his ambitions, and guilt over them, make {{a much more}} {{believable}} and compelling conflict than Matthew Morrison has had to convey {{for much of the}} season." [...] VanDerWerff complimented Morrison on his portrayal of Will: [...] "every time the show hands him anything to play that's something that makes vague sense, he does a good job with it." [...] Other <b>kudos</b> for the actors were provided by Respers France, who highlighted the [...] "further great acting" [...] seen during [...] "Finn and Quinn's moment in his truck", and E! Online Jenna Mullins, who called the scene where Finn and Kurt help Sue with her sister's room [...] "positively heartbreaking", and the trio of characters [...] "magnificent". Although Canning stated that [...] "Terri leaving lacked much punch", Poniewozik commented that it was [...] "satisfying to see her realized as an adult for once".|$|E
500|$|After {{writing and}} {{directing}} a short film I Am That Change produced by Allu Arjun, Sukumar provided {{the story and}} screenplay for Kumari 21F, his maiden feature film as a co-producer which was directed by his assistant Palnati Surya Pratap. He took inspiration from his college days in Razole where a young woman went to a picnic with some young men; a major undertaking for {{a woman at the}} time. Rumours were spread and the woman was labelled as a [...] "loose" [...] character, which stayed in Sukumar's mind. Produced on a budget of 60150 million, Kumari 21F grossed 380 million and became the 12th highest grossing Telugu film of the year. Siddharth Rao of The Times of India stated, [...] "In an industry where a damsel-in-distress-wooed-and-saved-by-an-angry-young-man is the norm, this is refreshing. <b>Kudos</b> to the writer Sukumar for giving yet another off-beat story with characters that can't be put into a box".|$|E
500|$|All of {{the musical}} numbers were {{generally}} praised, though not every number was received with the same enthusiasm. Benigno was disappointed that there was [...] "nothing special" [...] {{in any of the}} arrangements, but Futterman saw the performances from a different perspective: [...] "They're not as visually stunning, but they're vocally some of the more impressive renditions Glee has done all season." [...] She said of the [...] "Dreams" [...] rendition by Chenoweth with Morrison, [...] "The harmonies and bare-bones arrangement make for one of Glee most faithful covers yet." [...] Most critics welcomed the Chenoweth version. Gonzalez gave the song a [...] "B+" [...] and Brett Berk of Vanity Fair awarded it four stars of five; both praised Chenoweth but criticized Morrison. Semigran and Kubicek simply gave <b>kudos</b> to Chenoweth alone. Benigno wondered why the pair were trying to imitate Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when he felt they were better singers than those two, and gave the song a [...] "B".|$|E
