A few tree species, such as white ash, American elm, <b>eastern</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar,</b> and pin oak, also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, red maple, sugar maple, shagbark hickory and tulip trees.|$|E

5000|$|The presettlement {{vegetation}} {{would have}} been tallgrass prairie, broken by a swath of Big Woods flanking Minneopa Creek with oak savanna at the east end, and bottomland hardwood forest along the Minnesota River floodplain. Today these plant communities are largely intact, {{as much of the}} future park was unsuitable for agriculture, being too rocky, steep, or wet. The prairie is the most deteriorated as much of it was intensively used as livestock pasture. Its 355 acre are dominated by junegrass with a mix of other grasses and forbs and small <b>eastern</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedars.</b> Larger <b>red</b> <b>cedars</b> ring the prairie. Southeast of the prairie are 204 acre of old fields exhibiting ecological succession. Currently they feature bluegrass, bromegrass, Russian thistle, alfalfa, and seedlings of eastern cottonwood and willow. Controlled burning is being used {{to improve the quality of}} the prairie. [...] A 13 acre parcel is further along in its conversion from cultivation, with a very dense stand of young ash, basswood, elm, and boxelder.|$|R
40|$|The loessal {{plains and}} hills regions of central Nebraska and Kansas are {{included}} in this region {{as well as the}} Red Hills region of south-central Kansas and northern Oklahoma. The semi-arid region is characterized by seasonal moisture and temperature extremes of a continental climate. Elevation ranges from 1300 - 4000 feet. Precipitation ranges from 12 - 32 inches with 2 / 3 occurring during the growing season. Regional droughts are common. Vegetation Description This community is dominated by a mixture of tall (1 - 2 m) and mid (0. 5 - 1 m) grasses with an understory of shortgrasses (< 0. 5 m). Tallgrasses, primarily big bluestem and Indiangrass, are more abundant on lower slopes and bottoms, mid (primarily little bluestem, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, and Junegrass) and short grasses (primarily blue grama and buffalograss) dominate on upper slopes and ridge tops. Shortgrasses dominate heavily grazed sites. In presettlement times the shortgrasses and mid grasses were likely in presettlement times due to heavy bison grazing. Species diversity was moderate to high in the mixed grass prairie (Steinauer and Rolfsmeier 2003). Common forb species in the mixed grass prairie include western ragweed, fringed sage, prairie coneflower, scarlet globe mallow, scarlet gaura, and others. Shrubs and trees were a small component of the southern mixed grass prairie in presettlement times. Today exotic plants, such as smooth brome, cheatgrass, and Kentucky bluegrass and <b>eastern</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedars</b> are abundant in this prairie type. The exotics were not present in presettlement times and cedars were limited to fire-protected sites...|$|R

2500|$|The {{valley floor}} {{supports}} marshes and wet prairie interspersed with bottomland hardwood forest of willow, eastern cottonwood, American elm, silver maple, and green ash. The steep valley walls bear northern hardwood forest, although the cooler, moister north-facing slopes favor sugar maple, basswood, and common hackberry while the drier south slopes {{are characterized by}} bur oak, <b>eastern</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar,</b> and aspen.

Along Kittatinny Ridge {{in the northern part}} of the watershed are parts of Worthington State Forest (west), Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (central), and Stokes State Forests (east). In addition to these state forests, the Paulins Kill valley is host to a variety of common coniferous and deciduous trees, which have been harvested for lumber in the past, including: white oak and black oak, buttonwood, <b>eastern</b> <b>red</b> <b>cedar,</b> eastern hemlock, American chestnut, black walnut, tamarack larch, spruce, and pine. Trees that add to the beauty of the fall foliage include maple, birch, hickory, elm, and crab apple.|$|E

2500|$|The Metacomet Ridge hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England.

Prickly pear cactus has been recorded on the south-facing slopes of Ragged Mountain. [...] Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent upland plateaus containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Many bogs, ponds, and reservoirs lie cupped between trap rock ridge shelves, demonstrating the value of these ridges as important aquifers and wetland ecosystem habitats. Because the Metacomet Ridge generates such varied terrain, it is the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare. The Traprock Wilderness Recovery Strategy (1991) was an early attempt to protect the ridges from sprawl. It received the Connecticut Governor's Green Circle Award yet was ignored by authorities in Southington, Berlin, New Britain, and Meriden. Since then, sprawl has eroded the ecological integrity of the trail corridor, particularly in Southington. That said, Southington has acquired the Crescent Lake compartment, yet now has plans to log it (2014) without regard for the ecological sensitivity of the area.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Occupational asthma {{caused by}} western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> {{is a common}} prob-lem in sawmill industries. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine a possible association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genetic markers with sus-ceptibility or resistance to western <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> induced asthma. The distribution of DRB 1 and DQB 1 HLA class II alleles and DRB 1 -DQB 1 haplotypes was studied in 56 Caucasian patients with proven <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> asthma and 63 healthy Caucasian control subjects exposed to <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> dust. DRB 1 and DQB 1 high resolution typing was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-based method. Patients with <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> asthma had a higher frequency of HLA DQB 1 * 0603 and DQB 1 * 0302 alleles compared to a group of healthy exposed control subjects and a reduced frequency of DQB 1 * 0501 allele. The frequency of the DRB 1 * 0401 -DQB 1 * 0302 haplotype was increased and the DRB 1 * 0101 -DQB 1 * 0501 haplotype was re-duced. These findings suggest that genetic factors such as human leukocyte antigen class II antigens may be associated with susceptibility or resistance to development of <b>red</b> <b>cedar</b> asthma...|$|R
