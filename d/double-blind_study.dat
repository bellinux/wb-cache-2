25|$|A <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> {{with only}} {{objective}} measures {{is less likely}} to be biased to support a given conclusion. However, the researchers or the sponsors still have opportunities to skew the results by discarding or ignoring undesirable data, qualitatively characterizing the results, and ultimately deciding whether to publish at all. Also, not all studies are possible to conduct double-blind.|$|E

25|$|The adaptogenic {{nature of}} gypenosides {{have been found}} to keep blood {{pressure}} in a normal range. In vitro studies indicate that jiaogulan stimulates the release of nitric oxide in isolated heart cells; this is one proposed mechanism by which jiaogulan reduces high blood pressure. In a <b>double-blind</b> <b>study,</b> gypenosides administered to those with Grade II hypertension showed 82% effectiveness in reducing hypertension, compared to 46% for ginseng and 93% for indapamide (a hypertension medication).|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{a review}} of {{existing}} studies found that, on average, 40% of GERD patients also had H. pylori infection. The eradication of H. pylori can lead to an increase in acid secretion, leading {{to the question of whether}} H. pylori-infected GERD patients are any different than non-infected GERD patients. A <b>double-blind</b> <b>study,</b> reported in 2004, found no clinically significant difference between these two types of patients with regard to the subjective or objective measures of disease severity.|$|E
25|$|One small 2009 <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> of autistic {{children}} found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No {{differences were found between the}} HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

25|$|There is anecdotal {{evidence}} {{that the use of}} nitrox reduces post-dive fatigue, particularly in older and or obese divers; however a <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> to test this found no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue. There was, however, some suggestion that post dive fatigue is due to sub-clinical decompression sickness (DCS) (i.e. micro bubbles in the blood insufficient to cause symptoms of DCS); the fact that the study mentioned was conducted in a dry chamber with an ideal decompression profile may have been sufficient to reduce sub-clinical DCS and prevent fatigue in both nitrox and air divers. In 2008, a study was published using wet divers at the same depth and confirmed that no statistically significant reduction in reported fatigue is seen.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> of the Mayo Clinic {{found no significant}} difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E
25|$|Double-blind {{describes}} an especially stringent way of conducting an experiment which attempts to eliminate subjective, unrecognized biases carried by an experiment's subjects (usually human) and conductors. <b>Double-blind</b> <b>studies</b> were first used in 1907 by W.

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{pathological}} gambling, along with fluvoxamine, clomipramine has been shown effective in the treatment, with reducing the problems of pathological gambling in a subject by up to 90%. Whereas in trichotillomania, the use of clomipramine has again {{been found to be}} effective, fluoxetine has not produced consistent positive results. Fluoxetine, however, has produced positive results in the treatment of pathological skin picking disorder, although {{more research is needed to}} conclude this information. Fluoxetine has also been evaluated in treating IED and demonstrated significant improvement in reducing frequency and severity of impulsive aggression and irritability in a sample of 100 subjects who were randomized into a 14-week, <b>double-blind</b> <b>study.</b> Despite a large decrease in impulsive aggression behavior from baseline, only 44% of fluoxetine responders and 29% of all fluoxetine subjects were considered to be in full remission at the end of the study. Paroxetine has shown to be somewhat effective although the results are inconsistent. Another medication, escitalopram, has shown to improve the condition of the subjects of pathological gambling with anxiety symptoms. The results suggest that although SSRIs have shown positive results in the treatment of pathological gambling, inconsistent results with the use of SSRIs have been obtained which might suggest a neurological heterogeneity in the impulse-control disorder spectrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E
500|$|Bupropion {{has been}} used as a {{treatment}} for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) since at least 2004, with reports of positive results in both minors and adults. In a <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> of children, while aggression and hyperactivity as rated by the children's teachers were significantly improved in comparison to placebo, parents and clinicians could not distinguish between the effects of bupropion and placebo. The 2007 guideline on the ADHD treatment from American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry notes that the evidence for bupropion is [...] "far weaker" [...] than for the FDA-approved treatments. Its effect may also be [...] "considerably less than of the approved agents... Thus it may be prudent for the clinician to recommend a trial of behavior therapy at this point, before moving to these second-line agents." [...] Similarly, the Texas Department of State Health Services guideline recommends considering bupropion or a tricyclic antidepressant as a fourth-line treatment after trying two different stimulants and atomoxetine.|$|E

2500|$|Appropriate use of {{a placebo}} in a {{clinical}} trial often requires or at least benefits from a <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> design, which means that neither the experimenters nor the subjects know which subjects are in the [...] "test group" [...] and which are in the [...] "control group". This creates a problem in creating placebos that can be mistaken for active treatments.

2500|$|A psychoactive placebo {{was used}} in the Marsh Chapel Experiment, a <b>double-blind</b> <b>study</b> in which the {{experimental}} group received the psychedelic substance psilocybin while the control group received a large dose of niacin, a substance that produces noticeable physical effects intended to lead the control subjects to believe they had received the psychoactive drug. The term [...] "psychoactive placebo" [...] is rare in the literature; but, when it is used, it always denotes a placebo of this type.

40|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} prefer <b>double-blind</b> <b>studies,</b> {{but do not}} {{state that}} these are the only trial designs with regulatory value. The additional problems encountered when VKAs are the comparator are acknowledged, and this will remain an issue for several years to come, as VKAs will not be easily overtaken. A package comprising both open-label and double-blind pivotal randomised trials, preferably with internal consistency, offers the highest level of information as a basis for marketing authorisation. In case of discrepancy between the open-label and <b>double-blind</b> <b>studies</b> results, the latter would prevail. PROBE trials might be cheaper and simpler than double-blind ones, but are less precise [6]. An MAA based on a single pivotal open-label study of, e. g., an oral thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor versus a VKA would probably be regarded very suspiciously by regulatory authorities.

2500|$|Multiple {{double blind}} studies show venlafaxine's {{effectiveness}} in treating depression. Venlafaxine has similar efficacy to the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil) and imipramine, and is better tolerated than amitriptyline.

Higher doses of venlafaxine are more effective, and more patients achieved remission or were [...] "very much improved". The efficacy was similar {{if the number of}} patients who achieved [...] "response" [...] or were [...] "improved" [...] was considered. A meta-analysis comparing venlafaxine and combined groups of SSRI or tricyclic antidepressants showed venlafaxine's superiority. Judged by the same criteria, venlafaxine was similar in efficacy to the atypical antidepressant bupropion (Wellbutrin); however, the remission rate was significantly lower for venlafaxine.
