5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lighter tone.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relatively}} large fruiting bodies of R.pulcherrimus are distinctive, {{they might be}} confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> thicker stalk. Another similar species is R.haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas.|$|E

5|$|The black hood helps {{distinguish}} the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, {{the latter of}} which also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller beak. It has a higher-pitched call than the grey butcherbird and inhabits more open habitat. The juvenile pied butcherbird resembles the grey butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage.|$|E

5|$|Uranus (19.2AU), at 14 Earth masses, is {{the lightest}} {{of the outer}} planets.

5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|In a draw made {{prior to}} the quarter-finals, it was {{determined}} that the winner of the match between Cardiff and Toulouse would have home country advantage, meaning that they could choose any venue in their own country for the semi-finals, provided it was not their designated home ground. The winner of the match between Leicester and Bath was drawn against them as the away team. Cardiff elected to stage the game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which is located adjacent to their usual Cardiff Arms Park ground and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger capacity of 74,500, compared to the 12,500 capacity of the Arms Park. Cardiff had already moved their quarter-final game against Toulouse to the Millennium Stadium, despite being able to use their own ground at that stage of the competition, {{to take advantage of the}} increased capacity.|$|E

Crown glasses such as BK7 <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relatively small dispersion, while flint glasses <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> stronger dispersion (for visible light) and hence are more suitable for use in dispersive prisms.

5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer {{as seen from}} Earth. Indeed, the much smaller 7 Iris {{marginally}} exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well {{within the range of}} 10Ã—50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, right on the edge of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. albirictus) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> greater {{specific heat capacity}} than air and tends to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0Â°C (96.8Â°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was âˆ’10.3Â°C (13.5Â°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5Â°C (101.3Â°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
