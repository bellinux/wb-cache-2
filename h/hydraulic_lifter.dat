5000|$|All G-engines used solid {{valve lifters}} through the 1980 model year, with the {{exception}} of a small production test of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> in the 1978 model year. For model year 1981, all North American G-engines received top-fed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters.</b> Retrofitment in both directions is possible.|$|R
50|$|The first firm {{to include}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> in its design was the Cadillac V 16 engine (Model 452) first offered in 1930. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> were popular on cars {{designed}} in the 1980s, but most newer cars have reverted to bucket-and-shim mechanical lifters. Although these do not run as quietly and are not maintenance-free, they are cheaper and rarely need adjustment because the wear caused by operation is spread over a large area.|$|R
5000|$|The bypass sites provide <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> {{and trucks}} for {{transporting}} boats along key portages. They are {{located at the}} following points: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter,</b> {{situated}} {{between the}} camshaft and each engine's valve, is a hollow steel cylinder encasing an internal piston. This piston is {{held at the}} outer limit of its travel with a strong spring. The lobed camshaft rhythmically presses against the lifter, which transmits the motion to the engine valve one of two ways: ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{approach}} is to use an identical lifter to the ones being installed {{that has been made}} [...] "solid". Making a lifter solid is a process where the lifter piston is prevented from moving - this can be done with small welds made to the lifter, or by dis-assembling the lifter, removing the internal spring, and installing washers to take up the space and prevent the lifter piston from compressing. Some lifter manufacturers also sell solid versions of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> being installed.|$|E

50|$|A pumped {{oil system}} can use higher oil {{pressures}} and so makes {{the use of}} hydrostatic bearings easier. These gave a greater load capacity and soon became essential for small, lightweight engines such as in cars. It was this bearing design that saw the end of splash lubrication and total loss oiling. It disappeared from nearly all cars in the 1920s, although total loss continued in small low power stationary engines into the 1950s. Chevrolet used splash lubrication for their rod bearings until 1953, where it was phased out for the 235 'Six,' and then in 1954 when the 216 was eliminated from their line, and both the solid lifter and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> versions of the 235 had full-pressure lubrication.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve lifter, {{also known as}} a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
5000|$|The Boss 429 {{engine was}} derived from the Ford 385 engine. It used four-bolt mains, a forged steel crank and forged steel {{connecting}} rods. The engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, with a modified Hemi type combustion chamber which Ford called [...] "crescent". These heads used the [...] "dry-deck" [...] method, meaning no head gaskets were used. Each cylinder, oil passage and water passage had an individual [...] "O" [...] ring style seal to seal it tight. The Boss 429 engine used a single Holley four barrel carburetor rated at 735 CFM mounted on an aluminum intake manifold that flowed well for its time. 1969 cars featured a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> camshaft while 1970 models got a mechanical lifter camshaft along with an improved dual exhaust system though rated power output stayed the same.|$|E
5000|$|L-34: {{produced}} 1966-9, 10.25:1 compression, Holley (Q-jet 1968-9) carburetor, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters,</b> oval port closed chamber heads, {{forged steel}} crankshaft, and two-bolt main caps. It produced [...]|$|R
50|$|The 273 (4.5 L) was {{the first}} LA engine, {{beginning}} model year 1964 and offered through 1969, rated at 180 BHP. It had a 3.625 in (92 mm) bore and 3.31 in (84 mm) stroke. It had a mechanical solid lifter valvetrain until 1968 when <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> were introduced; <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> generally make for a quieter valvetrain. The reciprocating assembly included a cast or forged steel crankshaft, drop forged steel connecting rods and cast aluminum pistons. The valvetrain consisted of a cast nodular iron camshaft, solid or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters,</b> solid pushrods and shaft-mounted, malleable iron rocker arms (stamped steel on later hydraulic-cam engines). These actuated the overhead steel intake and exhaust valves. The cylinder heads featured wedge-shaped combustion chambers with a single intake and a single exhaust valve for each cylinder. Spark plugs were located {{in the side of}} the cylinder head, between the exhaust ports.|$|R
5000|$|Also <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> {{can create}} [...] "valve bounce" [...] at high RPM which is {{undesirable}} for performance uses. This is why engine tuners prefer solid lifters instead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanic}} installs {{the solid}} lifter and rotates the engine crank until the cam {{is on the}} [...] "base circle" [...] (not on any intake or exhaust cam lobe). An adjustable-length push-rod checking tool is then installed on the valve location being checked. The pushrod length checking tool is extended until there is no slop (zero lash). Then, the checking tool is removed and measured. The mechanic then adds [...]030-.090" [...] of additional length, depending on the specifications of the lifter being installed. [...] A more typical pre-load range used and recommended by most mechanics is {{in the neighborhood of}} [...]030-.060" [...] The length of the adjustable length push-rod plus the desired pre-load chosen then becomes the desired push-rod length that should be installed, which will keep the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> in the middle of its total piston-travel range. Example: Adjustable push-rod at zero lash = 9.0". Desired pre-load = [...]050". 9.0" [...] + [...]050" [...] = 9.050" [...] push-rods should be installed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{was also}} updated, {{although it was}} still based on a single, center-block-located camshaft pushing on hydraulic lifters and pushrods, one for each rocker arm. However, the cast nodular iron camshaft was of the [...] "roller" [...] type, with each lobe acting upon a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> with a roller bearing on the bottom; this made for a quieter, cooler-running valvetrain, but also allowed for a more aggressive valve lift. Each of the lifters acted upon a steel pushrod, which were of the [...] "oil-through" [...] type. This was another change for the Magnum. Because the new pushrods also served to provide oil {{to the top of}} the cylinder head, the rockers were changed to the AMC-style, screw-mounted, bridged half-shaft type. The new rockers also had a higher ratio: 1.6:1 compared to 1.5:1 in the LA engine, which increased leverage on the valves. In addition, the oil boss located at the end of the cylinder head on the LA engine was left undrilled, as it was no longer needed. However, the boss itself was left in place, perhaps to cut down on casting and machining costs, and to allow the use of earlier LA heads.|$|E
5000|$|The VC-25A {{has also}} been used to {{transport}} deceased former presidents. The guest area aft of [...] "the White House" [...] has chairs and tables that can be removed and the casket laid in their place. The bodies of Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford were transported by SAM 28000 and 29000 respectively to Washington for their state funerals, {{and then on to}} their final resting places. Colonel Mark Tillman, pilot for President George W. Bush, said, [...] "We'll take care of the president from basically when he's in office to when he lays in state." [...] For the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, Tillman said that the crew converted the front of the aircraft to look the way it would have appeared when Reagan was president; President and Nancy Reagan's Air Force One jackets were placed on the chairs to [...] "make them feel at home". A specially designed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> (similar to the type used by airline catering) with the presidential seal affixed to the sides lifts the casket up to the portside aft door to enter the VC-25A. The tradition of placing the caskets in the passenger cabin dates back to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, when the crew did not want the president's body placed in the cargo hold, and again during the state funeral of Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

50|$|From 1954 to 1963, the {{high-pressure}} 235 engine with mechanical {{valve lifters}} {{was used in}} some trucks. From 1956 to 1962, all 235 engines used in cars had <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 700SC {{was similar}} to Honda's 650 Nighthawk, though the Nighthawk S {{featured}} a 700 cc engine, shaft drive and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifters</b> in a bike with a completely redesigned engine.|$|R
5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lifter</b> and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E

Realistic values have been chosen for the parameters of this cam-follower mechanical system, and the checking of this modified mathematical model has been accomplished by means of a qualitative comparison with other models previously conceived, and with previous experimental results obtained from an automobile engine.
