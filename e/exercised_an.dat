5|$|Edmonton’s native Magic Lantern Theatres {{unexpectedly}} {{tried to}} buy the Princess for $500,000 on Christmas Eve 1996. A condition in the Brar's contract stated that the sale could be voided if another party bid at least ten percent more for the building. However, the Brars <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> option to match any higher bids, and the sale went through in early January 1997.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> {{option of}} his lease {{allowing}} him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that there was too little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Sheffield City Council {{negotiated}} with Yorkshire Water and leased an unused {{part of the}} former sewage works for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to enable it to be reclaimed {{and turned into a}} nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> option to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.|$|E

25|$|The largest dome in {{the world}} for more than 1,700 years was the Pantheon in Rome. Its {{concrete}} dome spans an interior space of 43.45m, which corresponds exactly to its height from floor to top. Its apex concludes with an 8.95m wide oculus. The structure remained unsurpassed until 1881 and stills holds the title of the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome {{in the world}}.

25|$|While UPN {{was still}} airing new episodes of Girlfriends, the network also began airing reruns five days per week. When the show moved to The CW network after UPN merged with The WB network, MyNetwork TV (which {{was created to}} take over UPN's former {{affiliate}} stations) picked up the rights to air reruns of Girlfriends, although they eventually discontinued this.

25|$|At Bathurst, Rutherford {{became a}} member of the council, had a term as mayor in 1868, and was {{treasurer}} to the Agricultural Society for 30 years. He encouraged the planting of trees in the town, and <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> open-handed philanthropy. During his long period as governing-director of Cobb and Co., he kept in touch with his large station-properties, riding large distances as a young man, and later often travelling in a kind of Cape cart. Even in his eighties he continued the supervision of his stations, and he died at Mackay, Queensland, on 13 September 1911, when returning from a visit to one of them. He left a widow, five sons, and five daughters.|$|E
25|$|Müller {{was born}} in Berlin. It was {{intended}} that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in Göttingen {{to the study of}} law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of Gustav Hugo. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend Friedrich von Gentz to take up political science. He had early formed a close intimacy with Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of Madame Bovary in 1856 {{was followed by}} more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel {{was the beginning of}} something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began to crowd out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Zola. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.|$|E

25|$|On April 22, 2014, the NFL {{announced}} that it had <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> option in ESPN's recent contract extension for Monday Night Football rights to air a first-round Wild Card playoff game on the channel after {{the conclusion of the}} 2014 season. This {{was the first time that}} an NFL playoff game was ever broadcast exclusively on cable television in the United States, in lieu of any of the league's broadcast network partners. The MNF broadcast team of Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden and sideline reporter Lisa Salters called the game, the first of the 2014–15 NFL playoffs. The Carolina Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27–16. As with all MNF games, the matchup was simulcast on WJZY in Charlotte and KASW in the Phoenix market to allow local viewers over-the-air access to the game.|$|E

Soon after {{he was elected to}} the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university in difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society he <b>exercised</b> <b>an</b> enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.|$|E

Among the options, barring that it chose to sell Viacom a 50% interest in the company for $450 million, the deal originally excluded Warner-Amex's 19% interest in Showtime-The Movie Channel, Inc.; that interest would have reverted to Warner, which intended to operate Warner-Amex as a wholly owned subsidiary.|$|E
