50|$|An {{exponentially}} averaging {{sound level}} meter, which gives {{a snapshot of}} the current noise level, is of limited use for hearing damage risk measurements; an integrating or integrating-averaging meter is usually mandated. An <b>integrating</b> <b>meter</b> simply integrates—or in other words 'sums'—the frequency-weighted noise to give sound exposure and the metric used is pressure squared times time, often Pa²·s, but Pa²·h is also used. However, because the unit of sound was historically described in decibels, the exposure is most often described in terms of sound exposure level (SEL), the logarithmic conversion of sound exposure into decibels.|$|E

5000|$|The Canon 7 was a {{rangefinder}} system camera {{produced by}} Canon Inc., the last {{compatible with the}} Leica M39 lens mount. It was introduced in September 1961, with an <b>integrated</b> Selenium <b>meter</b> cell. Further versions, branded Canon 7s and Canon 7s Type II (or Canon 7sZ), modified the design slightly by introducing a cadmium sulfide cell.|$|R
5000|$|Leica later used a {{variation}} of this system, as did Pentax with their <b>Integrated</b> Direct <b>Metering</b> (IDM) in the LX camera.A variation of this [...] "OTF" [...] system was used on early Olympus E-Series digital cameras to fine-tune the exposure just before the first curtain was released; for this to work, the first curtain was coated in a neutral grey colour.|$|R
5000|$|The IEC 61672-1 {{specifies}} [...] "three {{kinds of}} sound measuring instruments". They are the [...] "conventional" [...] sound level meter, the integrating-averaging sound level <b>meter,</b> and the <b>integrating</b> sound level <b>meter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Until 2003 {{there were}} {{separate}} standards for exponential and linear <b>integrating</b> sound level <b>meters,</b> {{but since then}} IEC 61672 has described both types. The classic exponential meter was originally described in IEC 123 for 'industrial' meters followed by IEC 179 for 'precision' meters. Both of these were replaced by IEC 651, later renamed IEC 60651, while the linear <b>integrating</b> <b>meters</b> were initially described by IEC 804, later renamed IEC 60804. Both IEC 60651 and 60804 included four accuracy classes, called [...] "types". In IEC 61672 these were reduced to just two accuracy classes 1 and 2. New in the standard IEC 61672 is a minimum 60 dB linear span requirement and Z-frequency-weighting, with a general tightening of limit tolerances, {{as well as the}} inclusion of maximum allowable measurement uncertainties for each described periodic test. The periodic testing part of the standard (IEC61672.3) also requires that manufacturers provide the testing laboratory with correction factors to allow laboratory electrical and acoustic testing to better mimic Free field (acoustics) responses. Each correction used should be provided with uncertainties, that need to be accounted for in the testing laboratory final Measurement uncertainty budget. This makes it unlikely that a sound level meter designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013. These 'withdrawn' standards should no longer be used, especially for any official purchasing requirements, as they have significantly poorer accuracy requirements than IEC 61672.|$|R

However, as autofocus SLRs became available from Minolta {{and others in the}} mid-1980s, Nikon's line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date.|$|R
50|$|After {{the war had}} ended, the Soviet Union demanded new sets of Contax tools {{from the}} {{original}} toolmaker in Dresden and then ordered {{a fair number of}} trial cameras to be made with Zeiss trademarks and coated lenses from these 1946 in postwar East Germany. With this successful, everything together with German instructors were transferred to Kiev. Missing specialists were in a few cases recruited in West Germany. Any still available parts went in the same direction. In fact, removing the front of some very early Kiev II cameras, one could see that the metal was originally stamped with the Contax name, then pressed out and re-stamped as Kiev.Kiev rangefinders retained the same lens mount as the prewar Contax rangefinders and the lenses can be interchanged. The cameras went through a few minor modifications to become the Kiev III and eventually Kiev 4. There was also a Kiev 5 with a modernized upper part with <b>integrated</b> <b>meter.</b> Attractive, though poorly made and unreliable, its production was soon terminated. The other models were kept in continually downgraded production until the 1980s. The number of Kievs vastly exceeded that of the pre-war Dresden and post-war Jena and Stuttgart Contaxes.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Pen F had a double-stroke {{film advance}} and a distinctive logo rendered in a gothic font.
