5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught <b>kids</b> <b>about</b> safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{increased}} media exposure {{was difficult}} for Fox, who acknowledged being shy and insecure, to adjust to. It also positioned her as a potential role model, and later led to her being typecast. She stated that people sometimes avoided her to remain out of the media's spotlight, {{and that she was}} a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. She rejected the notion of preaching to <b>kids</b> <b>about</b> appropriate behaviors, or about what women should be, but said that she could make young girls feel [...] "strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right." [...] Fox viewed her constant references to sex as feminist commentary and not simply headline-seeking, and wanted women and young girls to believe that it was okay to feel sexy and find power in that. She did not view being typecast as attractive as bad and felt that it can enable her to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film, and inspire her to be an overachiever, but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. MTV's Craig Flaster said that although Fox has [...] "been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol", she has shown comedic range.|$|E
