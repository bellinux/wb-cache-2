5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first developed on June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression developed on July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A tropical depression developed on July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a tropical storm. Originally, there was a tropical storm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a tropical storm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> in late September, but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E

Daniel finally confronts Vala {{for what he}} believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and mocking of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. As the years pass, each team member attempts {{to deal with the}} isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns how to play the cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry.

This opening gives more chance to win for both opponents, although the percentage of Black wins is still lower than the alternative 2...c5.

40|$|As new {{transactions}} update {{data sources}} and subsequently the data warehouse, the previously discovered association rules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old <b>database</b> {{may no longer}} be interesting rules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>database.</b> Furthermore, some new interesting rules may appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>database.</b> This paper presents a new algorithm for efficiently maintaining discovered association rules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> updated <b>database,</b> which starts by computing the high n level large itemsets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>database</b> using <b>the</b> available high n level large itemsets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old <b>database.</b> Some parts of the n- 1; n- 2, [...] ., 1 level large itemsets can then be quickly generated by applying the apriori property, thereby avoiding the overhead of calculating many lower level large itemsets that involve huge table scans...|$|R
5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database.</b> In the example we considered above, it's {{easy to see that}} the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E
5|$|Andalusians only {{began to}} be {{exported}} from Spain in 1962. The first Andalusians were imported into Australia in 1971, and in 1973 the Andalusian Horse Association of Australasia was formed for the registration of these Andalusians and their offspring. Strict quarantine guidelines prohibited the importation of new Andalusian blood to Australia for many years, but since 1999, regulations have been relaxed {{and more than half}} a dozen new horses have been imported. Bloodines in the United States also rely on imported stock, and all American Andalusians can be traced directly to the stud books in Portugal and Spain. There are around 8,500 animals in the United States, where the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association (IALHA) registers around 700 new purebred foals every year. These numbers indicate that the Andalusian is a relatively rare breed in the United States. In 2003, there were 75,389 horses registered in the stud book, and they constituted almost 66 percent of the horses in Spain. Breed numbers have been increasing during the 21st century. At the end of 2010, a total of 185,926 Pura Raza Española horses were recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> of the Spanish Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, y Medio Rural y Marino. Of these, 28,801 or about 15% were in other countries of the world; of those in Spain, 65,371 or about 42% were in Andalusia.|$|E
5|$|Storms {{were most}} likely to occur in May, {{followed}} by December. Out of all recorded storms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database,</b> only one cyclone was reported in the month of March; the 1908 March hurricane, as well as one tropical storm in February, which was the 1952 Groundhog Day Storm. In addition, only three tropical or subtropical cyclones formed in April ndash& a subtropical storm in 1992, Tropical Storm Ana of 2003, and Tropical Storm Arlene of 2017. A hurricane in 1938, a tropical storm in 1951, a subtropical storm in 1978, and Hurricane Alex of 2016 occurred in January. Of all cyclones during the off-season, Hurricane Lili in 1984 lasted the longest, for a total of 12 days. Hurricane Epsilon, which formed in November, maintained hurricane status for five days in December 2005, longer than any other storm in December; the previous record was two and a half days, set by Hurricane Lili in 1984. Additionally, Hurricane Alice in 1954–1955 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–2006 were the only recorded cyclones to have spanned two calendar years.|$|E

30|$|When the {{expression}} profiles of OsRUS genes from above three databases and our qRT-PCR experiment were analyzed together, {{it was found}} that some results were consistent, while some were not. For example, all six OsRUS genes were found to be expressed in all tissues examined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> RiceXPro <b>database</b> and our qRT-PCR experiments. However, only OsRUS 6 A and OsRUS 6 B were found to be expressed in all tissues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MPSS <b>database,</b> and only OsRUS 6 B was found to be expressed in all tissues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EST <b>database.</b> <b>The</b> expression level of OsRUS 1 was relatively low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three <b>databases</b> and <b>the</b> qRT-PCR results. OsRUS 1 expression was only detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MPSS <b>database</b> <b>in</b> NYL (14  days Young leaves) and NCA (35  days Callus), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EST <b>database</b> it was detected only in callus, leaf, panicle and stem. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> EST <b>database</b> only expression of OsRUS 6 B was detected in roots, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MPSS <b>database</b> OsRUS 2, OsRUS 3, OsRUS 6 A and OsRUS 6 B were detected <b>in</b> roots. <b>The</b> reasons for this inconsistency are typically complicated, and may be due to cultivar, environment, tissue stage and/or method sensitivity (Ma et al. 2011).|$|R
5|$|The Vs. Battle is the {{multiplayer}} mode {{where two}} to four players can compete simultaneously. Time Attack lets the player choose any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. An Internet ranking system was established where players enter a password on the official F-Zero website and get ranked based on their position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>database.</b> Players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race, which records their time and machine used. Ghost data, transparent re-enactments of the player's Time Attack performances, can be saved on memory cards to later race against. Up to five ghosts can be raced against simultaneously. The Replay mode allows saved Grand Prix and Time Attack gameplay to be replayed with different camera angles and in-game music. The Pilot Profile mode has each character's biography, theme music, information on their machine, and a short full motion video sequence.|$|E
