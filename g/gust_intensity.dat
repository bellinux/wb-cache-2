This study attempts to develop a multi-year climatology of sea breeze flows focusing on a Western Mediterranean coastal site. We used half-hourly meteorological records from a reference station in Alicante and sea surface temperature measurements at Albufereta beach to identify past sea breeze episodes, on the basis of an objective selection technique. A total of 475 sea breeze events during the 6 -year period were identified and the following parameters were determined: mean time of onset, mean wind speed and direction at the time of onset, mean time of cessation, mean temporal dimension (duration), mean maximum velocity, mean time of maximum velocity and mean wind path of the sea breeze. The mean onset and cessation times are 0940 UTC and 2009 UTC (local standard time = UTC + 0100 h, or + 0200 h with daylight-saving time), respectively, with a mean duration of 1029 h.

40|$|The {{generation}} of electricity from tidal currents is an emerging industry {{with the potential to}} contribute to the UK energy supply in a predictable and sustainable way. The development of the technology requires the cost effective subsea installation of energy conversion systems in an energetic and challenging marine environment. One concept developed for the fastening of tidal energy converters to the seabed is the Active Gravity Base (AGB), which offers potential reductions in installation cost and time, relative to existing fastening methods. The performance of this concept in response to unsteady flow conditions is explored within this thesis. The dynamic behaviour of a tidal current is driven by a range of factors from gravitational forces of celestial bodies to high-frequency fluctuations of turbulent eddies. The response of the AGB concept to the unsteadiness of tidal currents is herein considered under the two broad time-scales; the directionality of the mean semi-diurnal cycle and the high frequency variations from a given mean flow velocity. The correlation between the direction and velocity of the tidal flow was assessed using hourly averaged data provided by the Admiralty Charts in the northern UK waters. The resulting directionality model was used to predict the performance of the AGB under a range of quasi-steady flow conditions. High frequency velocity measurements of a potential tidal energy site were obtained through collaboration with the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This data was used to estimate the maximum perturbation from the mean velocity that can be expected on an annual basis. An experimental facility was developed within the re-circulating water flume at the University of Edinburgh to examine the dynamic loads generated by controllable two-dimensional flow perturbations. This was successfully achieved using a configuration of twin pitching foils with independent motion control. A relationship between the foil pitch angle and velocity perturbation time series was predicted using a vortex model of the foil wakes.

Information on mean wind profiles, <b>gust</b> factors, turbulence <b>intensity,</b> integral scale, and turbulence spectra and co-spectra is essential for developing realistic models of wind pressure and wind loads on structures. The research performed for this study was motivated by the fact that considerably fewer data and validated models are available for tropical than for extratropical storms. ^ Using the surface wind measurements collected by the Florida Coastal Monitoring Program (FCMP) during hurricane passages over coastal areas, this study presents comparisons of surface roughness length estimates obtained by using several estimation methods, and estimates of the mean wind and turbulence structure of hurricane winds over coastal areas under neutral stratification conditions. In addition, a program has been developed and tested to systematically analyze Wall of Wind (WoW) data, that will make it possible to perform analyses of baseline characteristics of flow obtained in the WoW. This program can be used in future research to compare WoW data with FCMP data, as gust and turbulence generator systems and other flow management devices will be used to create WoW flows that match as closely as possible real hurricane wind conditions. ^ Hurricanes are defined as tropical cyclones for which the maximum 1 -minute sustained surface wind speeds exceed 74 mph. FCMP data include data for tropical cyclones with lower sustained speeds. However, for the winds analyzed in this study the speeds were sufficiently high to assure that neutral stratification prevailed. This assures that the characteristics of those winds are similar to those prevailing in hurricanes. For this reason in this study the terms tropical cyclones and hurricanes are used interchangeably. ...|$|R
