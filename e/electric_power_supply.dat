5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing moisture content, (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> systems.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, {{construction}} started of an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for tracks at the port. Originally it had 500 volts direct current, {{but this}} was later reduced to 400 volts. Because an overhead wire could interfere with the cranes, third-rail conduction was chosen. However, because {{of the possibility of}} iron slimes spilling onto the tracks, the railway chose to use two third rail conductors, one {{on each side of the}} track, and avoid the return current running through the tracks. The electric components were delivered by Siemens-Schukert and were taken into use in 1912. The company took delivery of two electric locomotives, both with a Bo wheel arrangement, in 1910 and 1911. Sydvaranger operated one port train every 45 minutes, consisting of one locomotive and four hopper cars, with a combined [...] of ore.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Wimshurst {{developed}} a [...] "duplex machine". The device had two disks turning in opposite directions, with metallic conducting sectors on {{the surfaces of}} each. Compared to its predecessors, this machine was less sensitive to atmospheric conditions and did not require an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> This form of the machine was also improved by other developers (such as the Pidgeon machine developed by W. R. Pidgeon, which increased the electrical induction effect and its electrical output). In 1882, Wimshurst developed his [...] "Cylindrical Machine". By 1883, his improvements to the electrostatic generator led to the device being widely known as the Wimshurst machine. In 1885, {{one of the largest}} Wimshurst machines was built in England (and is now at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry).|$|E

2500|$|A memristor ( [...] ; a {{portmanteau}} {{of memory}} resistor) is a hypothetical non-linear passive two-terminal electrical component relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. [...] It was envisioned, and its name coined, in 1971 by circuit theorist Leon Chua. According to the characterizing mathematical relations, the memristor would hypothetically {{operate in the}} following way: The memristor's electrical resistance is not constant but depends {{on the history of}} current that had previously flowed through the device, i.e., its present resistance depends on how much electric charge has flowed in what direction through it in the past; the device remembers its history — the so-called non-volatility property. When the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is turned off, the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until it is turned on again.|$|E
