5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with <b>Gnosticism.</b> Christian <b>Gnosticism</b> did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of <b>Gnosticism</b> is to assume that <b>Gnosticism</b> had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E
5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. <b>Gnosticism</b> taught that salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E
5|$|In Hubbard's {{efforts to}} shift from a psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he {{introduced}} the concept of thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to <b>Gnosticism,</b> although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by <b>Gnosticism.</b> However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of <b>Gnosticism,</b> various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} {{after the completion}} of Shin Megami Tensei II and Shin Megami Tensei If..., but was delayed as the team worked out what they wanted for the game, including making it appeal to a wider audience than previous Megami Tensei games. Unlike the science fiction setting of Shin Megami Tensei II, Nocturne returned to a contemporary setting similar to the original game. The setting and characters were inspired by multiple elements, including <b>Gnosticism,</b> Mahayana Buddhism, and modern popular culture. Among the things the team changed from previous entries were the camera perspective, which was switched from a first- to a third-person camera perspective, and using a cel-shaded art style to distinguish it from other games of the time. The music, primarily composed by Shoji Meguro, paid homage to earlier Megami Tensei titles while drawing on music styles from the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Valentinian <b>Gnosticism</b> {{was one of}} {{the major}} forms of <b>Gnosticism</b> that Irenaeus opposed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{research}} into the origins of <b>Gnosticism</b> proposed Persian origins or influences, spreading to Europe and incorporating Jewish elements. According to Wilhelm Bousset (1865–1920), <b>Gnosticism</b> {{was a form of}} Iranian and Mesopotamian syncretism, and Richard August Reitzenstein (1861–1931) most famously situated the origins of <b>Gnosticism</b> in Persia.|$|E
25|$|Hans Jonas (1903–1993) took {{an existential}} phenomenological {{approach}} to <b>Gnosticism.</b> According to Jonas, alienation is a distinguishing characteristics of <b>Gnosticism,</b> making it different from contemporary religions. Jonas compares this alienation with the existentialist notion of geworfenheit, being {{thrown into a}} hostile world.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Gnosticism,</b> the Archon Astaphaios is {{depicted}} with a hyena face.|$|E

25|$|Dillon {{notes that}} <b>Gnosticism</b> raises {{questions}} about the development of early Christianity.|$|E
25|$|The Christian heresiologists, {{most notably}} Irenaeus, {{regarded}} <b>Gnosticism</b> as a Christian heresy. Modern scholarship notes that early Christianity was very diverse, and Christian orthodoxy only {{settled in the}} 4thCentury, when the Roman Empire declined and <b>Gnosticism</b> lost its influence. Gnostics and proto-orthodox Christians shared some terminology. Initially, they were hard to distinguish from each other.|$|E
25|$|Hermeticism {{is closely}} related to <b>Gnosticism,</b> but its {{orientation}} is more positive.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} and {{translation of the}} Nag Hammadi library after 1945 has had a huge effect on <b>Gnosticism</b> since World War II. Intellectuals who were heavily influenced by <b>Gnosticism</b> in this period include Lawrence Durrell, Hans Jonas, Philip K. Dick and Harold Bloom, with Albert Camus and Allen Ginsberg being more moderately influenced. Celia Green has written on Gnostic Christianity in relation to her own philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{approached}} <b>Gnosticism</b> from {{a psychological}} perspective, which {{was followed by}} Gilles Quispel. According to this approach, <b>Gnosticism</b> is a map for the human development, in which an undivided person, centered on the Self, develops out of the fragmentary personhood of young age. According to Quispel, gnosis is a third force in western culture, alongside faith and reason, which offers an experiential awareness of this Self.|$|E
25|$|Hans Jonas discerned {{two main}} {{currents}} of <b>Gnosticism,</b> namely Syrian-Egyptian, and Persian, which includes Manicheanism and Mandaeanism. Among the Syrian-Egyptian {{schools and the}} movements they spawned are a typically more Monist view. Persian <b>Gnosticism</b> possesses more dualist tendencies, reflecting a strong influence from the beliefs of the Persian Zurvanist Zoroastrians. The medieaval the Cathars, Bogomils, and Carpocratians seem to include elements of both categories.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the Demiurge in some {{versions}} of ancient <b>Gnosticism</b> also often portrayed the Demiurge as a generally evil entity.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, Alexandria {{was a major}} {{center of}} the {{cosmopolitan}} religious movement called <b>Gnosticism</b> (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} (and possibly) late first century, <b>Gnosticism</b> was a {{competing}} religious tradition to Christianity which shared {{some elements of}} theology.|$|E
25|$|The Gnostic {{ideas and}} systems {{flourished in the}} Mediterranean world {{in the second century}} AD, in {{conjunction}} with and influenced by the early Christian movements and Middle Platonism. After the Second Century, a decline set in, but <b>Gnosticism</b> persisted throughout the centuries as an undercurrent of western culture, remanifesting with the Renaissance as Western esotericism, taking prominence with modern spirituality. In the Persian Empire, <b>Gnosticism</b> spread as far as China with Manicheism, while Mandaeism is still alive in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{scholarship}} largely {{agrees that}} <b>Gnosticism</b> has Jewish or Judeo-Christian origins, {{originating in the}} late First Century AD in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects.|$|E
25|$|Early 20th Century thinkers who heavily {{studied and}} were {{influenced}} by <b>Gnosticism</b> include Carl Jung (who supported <b>Gnosticism),</b> Eric Voegelin (who opposed it), Jorge Luis Borges (who included it in many of his short stories), and Aleister Crowley, with figures such as Hermann Hesse being more moderatedly influenced. Rene Guenon founded the gnostic review, Le Gnose in 1909, before moving to a more Perennialist position, and founding his Traditionalist School. Gnostic Thelemite organizations, such as Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and Ordo Templi Orientis, trace themselves to Crowley's thought.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} <b>Gnosticism</b> and of early Alexandrian Christianity {{received}} a strong impetus from {{the discovery of}} the Coptic Nag Hammadi Library in 1945. A great number of translations have been published, and the works of Elaine Pagels, Professor of Religion at Princeton University, especially The Gnostic Gospels, which detailed the suppression of some of the writings found at Nag Hammadi by early bishops of the Christian church, has popularized <b>Gnosticism</b> in mainstream culture, but also incited strong responses and condemnations from clergical writers.|$|E
25|$|Some early Christian Gnostic sects professed reincarnation. The Sethians and {{followers}} of Valentinus believed in it. The {{followers of}} Bardaisan of Mesopotamia, a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon Chaldean astrology, to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including {{a sort of}} metempsychosis. Another such teacher was Basilides (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of Irenaeus {{and the work of}} Clement of Alexandria (see also Neoplatonism and <b>Gnosticism</b> and Buddhism and <b>Gnosticism).</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of Nag Hammadi, the Gnostic movements were largely perceived through the lens of the early church heresiologists. Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (1694-1755) proposed that <b>Gnosticism</b> developed on its own in Greece and Mesopotamia, spreading to the west and incorporating Jewish elements. According to Mosheim, Jewish thought took Gnostic elements and used them against Greek philosophy. J.Horn and Ernest Anton Lewald proposed Persian and Zoroastrian origins, while Jacques Matter described <b>Gnosticism</b> as an intrusion of eastern cosmological and theosophical speculation into Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{discovery}} of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 <b>Gnosticism</b> was known primarily through the works of heresiologists, Church Fathers who opposed those movements. These writings had an antagonistic bias towards gnostic teachings, and were incomplete. Several heresiological writers, such as Hippolytus, made little effort to exactly record the nature of the sects they reported on, or transcribe their sacred texts. Reconstructions of incomplete Gnostic texts were attempted in modern times, but research on <b>Gnosticism</b> was coloured by the orthodox views of those heresiologists.|$|E
25|$|The {{animated}} TV series Æon Flux draws {{its name}} {{and some of}} its iconography from <b>Gnosticism,</b> notably aeons (the two main characters forming a syzygy) and a demiurge.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{scholarship}} largely {{agrees that}} <b>Gnosticism</b> has Jewish or Judeo-Christian origins; this theses is most notably {{put forward by}} Gershom G. Scholem (1897–1982) and Gilles Quispel (1916–2006).|$|E
25|$|A major {{question}} in scholarly {{research is the}} qualification of <b>Gnosticism,</b> based {{on the study of}} its texts, as either an interreligious phenomenon or as an independent religion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gnosticism</b> scholar Elaine Pagels {{goes further}} and {{claims that the}} author himself was a Gnostic, citing {{similarities}} with the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, biblical {{scholars}} since Schleiermacher in 1807 {{have noted}} that the pastoral epistles seem to argue against a more developed <b>Gnosticism</b> than would be compatible with Paul's time.|$|E
25|$|Although Colossians is {{witnessed}} {{by the same}} historical sources as the undisputed texts, Pauline authorship of Colossians has found some critics. It was originally doubted by F. C. Baur, though others working from his general thesis, such as H. J. Holtzmann, argued that an original brief Pauline text experienced many interpolations by a later editor. The basis for the early objection was that the letter aimed at refuting <b>Gnosticism,</b> a heresy which had not reached its ascendancy until the early 2nd century. This thesis was questioned {{in an analysis of}} <b>Gnosticism</b> by R. Wilson, where he contended that the supposed parallels were unsupported.|$|E
25|$|Platonic usage also {{impacted}} Christian usage, {{for example}} in <b>Gnosticism.</b> In Tertullian's Against the Valentinians, he gives the name {{to one of their}} thirty aeons as monogenes in a syzygy with makaria, Blessedness.|$|E
25|$|During the {{religious}} peace which followed {{the persecution of}} Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against <b>Gnosticism.</b> The most famous of these writings is Adversus haereses (Against Heresies). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may {{have taken place in}} Asia Minor or in Rome. However, it also appears that <b>Gnosticism</b> was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of 'Marcus the Magician' living and teaching in the Rhone valley.|$|E
