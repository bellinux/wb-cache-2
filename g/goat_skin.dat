25|$|In some universities, {{the word}} {{parchment}} is still {{used to refer}} to the certificate (scroll) presented at graduation ceremonies, even though the modern document is printed on paper or thin card; although doctoral graduands may be given the option of having their scroll written by a calligrapher on vellum. The University of Notre Dame still uses animal parchment for its diplomas. Similarly, University of Glasgow and Heriot-Watt University use <b>goat</b> <b>skin</b> parchment for their degrees.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} butter {{would have}} been from sheep or goat's milk; cattle are not {{thought to have been}} domesticated for another thousand years. An ancient method of butter making, still used today in parts of Africa and the Near East, involves a <b>goat</b> <b>skin</b> half filled with milk, and inflated with air before being sealed. The skin is then hung with ropes on a tripod of sticks, and rocked until the movement leads to the formation of butter.|$|E
25|$|Most {{illuminated}} manuscripts {{were created}} as codices, which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on papyrus. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of calf, sheep, or <b>goat</b> <b>skin),</b> but most manuscripts {{important enough to}} illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum, traditionally made of unsplit calfskin, though high quality parchment from other skins was also called parchment.|$|E
60|$|The cap I wore on my head, was great, high, and shapeless, {{made of a}} <b>goat's</b> <b>skin,</b> with a flap of pent-house {{hanging down}} behind, not only to keep the sun from me, but to shoot the rain off from running into my neck, nothing being more pernicious than the rain falling upon the flesh in these climates. I had a short jacket of <b>goat's</b> <b>skin,</b> whose hair hung down such a length on each side, that it reached down to the calves of my legs. As for shoes and stockings, I had none, but made a semblance of something, I know not what to call them; they were made like buskins, and laced on the sides like spatterdashes, Barbarously shaped {{like the rest of}} my habit. I had a broad belt of <b>goat's</b> <b>skin</b> dried, girt round me with a couple of thongs, instead of buckles; on each of which, to supply the {{deficiency}} of sword and dagger, hung my hatchet and saw. I had another belt, not so broad, yet fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder, {{and at the end of}} it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, made of <b>goat's</b> <b>skin,</b> to hold my powder and shot. My basket I carried on my back, and my gun on my shoulder; and over my head a great clumsy ugly <b>goat's</b> <b>skin</b> umbrella; which, however, next to my gun, was the most necessary thing about me. As for my face, the colour was not so swarthy as the Mulattoes, or might have been expected from one who took to little care of it, in a climate within nine or ten degrees of the equinox. At one time my beard grew so long that it hung down about a quarter of a yard; but as I had both razors scissors in store, I cut it all off, and suffered none to grow, except a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, the like of which I had seen wore by some Turks at Sallee, not long enough indeed to hang a hat upon, but of such a monstrous size, as would have amazed any in England to have seen.|$|R

40|$|Skins {{and hides}} are {{perishable}} {{resources that can}} be damaged by parasitic diseases and human error, which result in downgrading or rejection. This {{study was conducted to}} identify defect types and to determine their prevalence in pickled sheep and wet blue <b>goat</b> <b>skins</b> and wet blue hides. Each selected skin or hide was examined for defects in natural light and the defects were graded according to established quality criteria in Ethiopian standard manuals. Major defects were captured by digital photography. The major pre-slaughter defects included scratches (64. 2 %), cockle (ekek) (32. 8 %), wounds or scars (12. 6 %), lesions from pox or lumpy skin disease (6. 1 %), poor substance (5 %), branding marks (2. 3 %) and tick bites (1. 5 %). The presence of grain scratches in wet blue hides (76. 3 %) was significantly higher than in pickled sheep (67. 2 %) and wet blue goat (59. 1 %) skins. The major slaughter defects included flay cuts or scores, holes, poor pattern and vein marks, with a higher occurrence in wet blue <b>goat</b> <b>skins</b> (28. 7 %; P < 0. 001) than in wet blue hides (22. 8 %) and pickled sheep skins (11. 1 %). The most prevalent postslaughter defects were grain cracks (14. 9 %), hide beetle damage (8 %), damage caused by heat or putrefaction (3. 7 %) and machine-induced defects (0. 5 %). Grain cracks (27. 04 %) and hide beetle damage (13. 9 %) in wet blue <b>goat</b> <b>skins</b> were significantly more common than in wet blue hides and pickled sheep skins. These defects cause depreciation {{in the value of the}} hides and skins. Statistically significant (P < 0. 001) higher rejection rates were recorded for wet blue hides (82. 9 %) than for pickled sheep skins (18. 3 %) and wet blue <b>goat</b> <b>skins</b> (8. 5 %). Improved animal health service delivery, effective disease control strategies and strong collaboration between stakeholders are suggested to enhance the quality of skins and hides...|$|R

50|$|Along with sheep, goats {{were among}} the first domesticated animals. The {{domestication}} process started at least 10,000 years ago in what is now northern Iran. Easy human access to goat hair, meat, and milk were the primary motivations. <b>Goat</b> <b>skins</b> were popularly used until the Middle Ages for water and wine bottles when traveling and camping, and in certain regions as parchment for writing.|$|R
2500|$|Equestrian chaps, {{with the}} {{exception}} of woolies, are traditionally made of cowhide. [...] Woolies, some Zamorros, and a few other historic or ethnic styles may be made with the hair or wool still on the hide, usually cowhide, sheepskin, or Angora <b>goat</b> <b>skin.</b> [...] Historically, they also included seal, bear, and buffalo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drum shell}} {{is made of}} hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use {{depending}} on the region where the drum is made. [...] To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. [...] The heads are usually <b>goat</b> <b>skin,</b> and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. [...] However, one head may be <b>goat</b> <b>skin</b> to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. [...] Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. [...] Rope threaded {{back and forth across}} the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. [...] Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. [...] Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.|$|E
2500|$|The cuisine {{of ancient}} Greece {{included}} a dairy product known as oxygala (...) which {{is believed to}} have been a form of yogurt. Galen (AD 129– c. 200/c. 216) mentioned that oxygala was consumed with honey, similar to the way thickened Greek yogurt is eaten today. The oldest writings mentioning yogurt are attributed to Pliny the Elder, who remarked that certain [...] "barbarous nations" [...] knew how [...] "to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity". The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk by Mahmud Kashgari and Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century. Both texts mention the word [...] "yogurt" [...] in different sections and describe its use by nomadic Turks. The earliest yogurts were probably spontaneously fermented by wild bacteria in <b>goat</b> <b>skin</b> bags.|$|E

2500|$|They were {{recruited}} from among {{the ranks of the}} non-Muslim subject nations of the empire, such as Jews, Romani, Greeks, Albanians, Armenians and others. The dances, collectively known as köçek oyunu, blended Arab, Greek, Assyrian and Kurdish elements (Karsilamas dance and Kaşık Havası dance). They were performed to a particular genre of music known as köçekçe, which was performed in the form of suites in a given melody. It too was a mix of Sufi, Balkan and classical Anatolian influences, some of which survives in popular Turkish music today. The accompaniment included various percussion instruments, such as the davul-köçek, the davul being a large drum, one side covered with <b>goat</b> <b>skin</b> and the other in sheep skin, producing different tones. A köçek's skill would be judged not only on his dancing abilities but also on his proficiency with percussion instruments, especially a type of castagnette known as the çarpare. [...] The dancers were accompanied by an orchestra, featuring four to five each kaba kemençe and laouto as principal instruments, used exclusively for köçek suites. There were also two singers. A köçek dance in the Ottoman seraglio (palace harem) involved one or two dozen köçeks and many musicians. The occasions of their performances were wedding or circumcision celebrations, feasts and festivals, as well as the pleasure of the sultans and the aristocracy.|$|E

He felt around upon the ground beside him searching for some missile, and at last his fingers touched a stone and closed upon it. Raising it above his antagonist's head the Hon.
