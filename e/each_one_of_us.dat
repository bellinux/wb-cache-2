Chopra told Cosmopolitan: [...] "It's empowering in that way, which doesn't say that sexual freedom is what empowerment needs to necessarily be. It's extremely individual to <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> As for Alex, she happens to not care." [...] The character treats men as dispensable entities, similar to how men usually treat women. She does not treat men as if they are {{the most important thing in}} her life because she is more focused on her work, with men just happen to come and go in her life. Chopra explained [...] "I think that's extremely empowering on her end. It may not be something I personally agree with or something I do, but I think different people have different individual choices that they make." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs. Such an act is wrong to the public at large, not only to those who might be injured. [...] "Due care is a duty imposed on <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene." ...|$|E

The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word."

We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final year}} of the war—1918—started with {{disaster}} and ended in triumph. On 21 March 1918, General Erich Ludendorff, Chief of the German General Staff, launched the Spring Offensive, which was intended to defeat the Allies on the Western Front before {{the strength of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) could become overwhelming. The main weight of the first blow—Operation Michael—fell on General Gough' s Fifth Army which was forced to retreat. In response to the crisis facing the Allies, French Generalissimo Ferdinand Foch was made Supreme Commander of the Allied forces on the Western Front, placing the BEF under his strategic direction. The next German attack came south of Ypres in the Battle of the Lys river and here too the BEF fell back. Field Marshal Haig issued his famous Order of the Day, [...] "With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, <b>each</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> must fight on to the end." [...] A third major German offensive, falling mainly on the French, was finally halted on the Marne in June. On 8 August, General Rawlinson's Fourth Army launched the Battle of Amiens which marked the start of the Hundred Days Offensive, the final Allied offensive on the Western Front. Over the following weeks, all five armies of the BEF went on the offensive from the Somme to Flanders. Fighting continued right up until the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11:00 am on 11 November 1918.|$|E
