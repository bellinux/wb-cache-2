40|$|This thesis {{promotes}} {{a consideration of}} theatre as an essentially social skill rather than a dramatic one. It argues that theatre is dependent for its very existence on the social context and the available representational grammars which are firmly grounded in that context. It examines the theatrical experience through field work {{and a number of}} interviews with those involved in that experience. It considers the author and the basis and extent of his authority; the director and his perceived part in the production process; the history of criticism and the critics' current role; the actor and his relationship with the audience for whom he plays, {{and the ways in which}} the particular style of participation in performance is negotiated both at an acceptedly "theatrical" occasion and a situation where the definition of performance is pushed to its limits. It proposes that the study of theatricality, much hindered by the persistent and now cliched metaphor of life as theatre, is the study of sociality itself. The institution of theatricality is a set of patterned norms for representing social experience and this makes its study peculiarly pertinent to a sociological approach. It suggests that dramatic performance is the use of general <b>interpretive</b> <b>modes</b> for a particular reason, that being precisely to highlight that society consists of just such ways of being together...|$|R

Irigaray’s Madonna is an ethical listener, interpreter and exchanger of ‘sacred’ discourse and it is this aspect of Mary that warrants our allegiance.

40|$|In 1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher {{declared}} publicity {{to be the}} ‘oxygen’ of terrorism. Speaking {{from within}} a climate of domestic terrorism, such a statement draws into question the nature of contemporary media coverage. The British Broadcasting Corporation, existing as a public sector broadcaster, occupies a unique position {{in the context of}} 20 th and 21 st century mass media. The BBC is central to the creation and direction of national and international news agendas, in the formation of worldwide public opinion, and the brand name and reputation hold connotations of honesty, accuracy and impartiality. It can therefore be positioned as a ‘a microcosm of some larger system or a whole society' (Gomm et al., 2000, p. 99). Yet, the historical visual output of the organisation in relation to domestic terrorism emanating from the environment of the Troubles — a significant period in social, cultural, political, and media history — has never been subject to rigorous academic scrutiny. Grounded in the field of media and cultural studies, and drawing upon extensive archival research, this thesis investigates the representation of domestic terror by the BBC in news and documentary format over the three-decade period of 1968 - 1998 through two <b>interpretive</b> <b>modes</b> of textual analysis: content analysis and semiotics. Throughout, the representation of events is contextualised in relation to media theory, with the words and pictures broadcast by the BBC analysed. The framing of acts of terror as image events is considered, as well as the visual aesthetic, codes, and values, of news reports. Ultimately, this work argues that BBC coverage of the Troubles has clear and identifiable patterns and symbols. Initial outbreaks of violence, where no corresponding representational referents existed, trended towards the vivid and graphic. Gradually, however, there was an overt movement away from this form; with the notable exception of moments where a method of perception created a disjuncture to established means, coverage was dominated by generic media templates, the rhetoric of euphemism, a concerted lack of contextualisation, and empty symbolism of the absent image...|$|R

All aspects of the project retain a focus on demonstrating the importance of art as a significant tool to bring attention to history. This is a project by an artist working within a worldwide community that retains links to a convict past, not the work of an historian. With the recent World Heritage nomination of eleven convict sites within Australia this research is pertinent to current concerns within {{the heritage}} and tourism industries regarding the communication of these sites to a non [...] ‐expert, cross [...] ‐cultural, international audience. Sites central to the research include Maria Island, Cascades Female Factory and Woolmers Estate. Attention to conventional history is used to inform the practice component of the project. Producing and presenting past experiences of each site through art in the form of exhibitions, installations and performance art is one possible interpretation strategy. Reference has been made to artists who have worked in similar themes and media including Hossein Valamanesh and Angela Valamanesh, Anne Ferran, Fiona Hall and Julie Gough, and to Susan Best’s ideas of affect.

The 2 ̆ 2 law and {{literature}} 2 ̆ 2 movement to date {{consists of two}} rather different enterprises and concerns. The older, more familiar variety, 2 ̆ 2 law in literature, 2 ̆ 2 consists of examining literary works such as Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Merchant of Venice, Melville 2 ̆ 7 s Billy Budd, or Kafka 2 ̆ 7 s The Trial for their insight into and assessment of legal issues and problems. The second the driving force in the recent law {{and literature}} movement - emphasizes interpretation of literary and legal texts. Interpretation, of course, has always been central to literary and humanistic endeavors, but has taken on growing importance for law as belief in literature as a unique variety of text has eroded. The tendency to speak about legal and literary texts {{in the same breath}} thus seems more appropriate than it might have in earlier decades and largely stems from changes in modes of literary criticism. Interest is now focused {{on the extent to which}} the same or similar <b>interpretive</b> <b>modes</b> and strategies can or should be employed in a variety of different discourses. Alexander Welsh 2 ̆ 7 s Strong Representations: Narrative and Circumstantial Evidence in Englanddoes not fit easily into either category. It may be thought of as having extended the boundaries of the second, more recent development of law and literature studies. Perhaps Welsh, a distinguished literary scholar, has even developed a third variety, one that seeks to link legal modes of thought of particular historical eras with non-legal cultural experience of the same era. Welsh attempts to demonstrate a close relationship between eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century concepts of circumstantial evidence in English criminal law and the development of the English novel during that period. If that were all he attempts one might wish simply to state his thesis, suggest the extent to which he is able to support it, and be done with it. But he has done a good deal more-he has begun to explore the relatively unknown area of the history of the Anglo-American law of evidence, and has attempted to show how both literary and legal concepts of evidence were linked to the wider world, in the areas of religion and natural science. If he has not been altogether successful, he has made a significant foray into an important, though little explored, area of law and culture...|$|R

40|$|By {{investigating}} {{the connections between}} the real, remembered and imagined, this research project set out as an inquiry into the capacity of painting {{to function as a}} mnemonic device. People who use such devices can be referred to as “memorists” (Reber, Allen & Reber 2009). Through process-based drawing, collage and painting, I placed objects, imbued with traumatic family histories, into compositions that were visual attempts at remembering spaces of my childhood. My intention was to test relationships that exist between drawing and collage and how each of these processes could bring to painting the experience of remembering. Painting, I concluded, was an articulate practice that benefited from the disjointed and fragmentary nature of collage as a preparatory process. The paintings draw on remembered events with the backdrop of the 1960 s and 1970 s of my childhood. Inherited objects from this time provide evidence of my ancestral trauma of penury, diaspora and war. In my hand these vestige objects have the literal weight of their primary function and the metaphoric weight of memories. Vestige describes a disparate group of inherited ancestral objects including a bayonet from the Great War, a family bible, and whimsies such as a ceramic figurine. The paintings are about these real objects and their histories painted on canvas from life or photographs, coalescing in contextual spaces based on uncertain childhood memories. The project was supported by research into theories of memory, objects and landscape. Each contribution, philosophical or clinical, co-acted for strategies and methodologies in making. Psychoanalytic theories (of van der Kolk, Laplanche and Pontalis) provided working definitions of memory-recall that aligned with painting strategies in the studio. The work of Maurice Halbwachs offered insights into existential questions relating to physical objects in daily contact and notions of permanence and stability. Ian Farr theorised on the role of landscape in the consciousness of childhood. Jill Bennett, in her work Empathic Vision, discusses the use of fiction and fantasy in art that endeavours to visually register experience of traumatic memory. Artworks discussed in the Context chapter, 2 are significant because they exemplify the evocative potency of trauma, memory, banal objects and interior spaces in collage and painting. The work explores various <b>interpretive</b> <b>modes</b> of painting that challenge ways of perceiving the encounters between subjective realities and the above topics. Examination of work by Albert Tucker and Imants Tillers provided a perspective on trauma and diaspora. Paintings by Matthias Weischer and Dexter Dalwood are used to discuss the relationship between pictorial ‘interior space’ and memory. Historical perspectives on still life and collage in the work of Picasso and Braque are contrasted with a contemporary collaging of ‘tabletop’ space in the work of James Lynch. In conclusion I found that vestige objects have the ability to draw something out of the painter, more than could have been understood {{at the beginning of the}} project. An intimate engagement was established with the objects. They were near enough to be touched and constantly scrutinised. This intimacy allowed me to reflect on their original intended functions: killing, advertising and story-telling, all being different from their banal utilitarian, domestic functions as remembered from childhood. The paintings problematize the relationships between real objects, their remembered banality and their representation in paint. My thesis demonstrates that, with the techniques I have employed, I can bring these things together. Paintings have considerable coherency (structurally) to offer a plausible pictorial account of how one might visualise and make sense of the snippets of childhood memory that have such a significant role to play in psychological and social formation...|$|R
40|$|Commitment to {{individually}} authentic {{participation is}} {{an important element of}} successfully inclusive communities and societies. Not only characterized by diversity, such groups have organized themselves to draw upon that diversity for problemsolving and synergistic creativity. At the same time, and sometimes in conflict with that belief, most societies identify particular skills and abilities as singularly important to legitimate adult participation and, therefore, as generalizable. These cultural tools are likely to dominate the established curricula of schools: mathematics, language, literacy, science. One method for ensuring that all citizens have access to these participatory tools is to entrench them in public policy. Well-meant though they might be, for some children such policies negatively impact their authentic participation.

The equilibrium reconstruction and linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability simulation chain was applied, in particular, to the analysis of the edge MHD stability of ASDEX Upgrade type-I ELMy H-mode discharges and ITER hybrid scenario, demonstrating the stabilizing effect of an increased Shafranov shift on edge <b>modes.</b> <b>Interpretive</b> simulations of a JET hybrid discharge were performed with two electromagnetic turbulence codes within ITM infrastructure showing the signature of trapped-electron assisted ITG turbulence. A successful benchmark among five EC beam/ray-tracing codes was performed in the ITM framework for an ITER inductive scenario for different launching conditions from the equatorial and upper launcher, showing good agreement of the computed absorbed power and driven current. Selected achievements and scientific workflow applications targeting key modelling topics and physics problems are also presented, showing the current status of the ITM-TF modelling suite...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} intercultural {{communication}} {{has been criticized}} for failing to produce studies which focus on actual practices of communication, especially of intercultural encounters. Of particular interest have been cultural analyses of social interactions, as well as analyses of the intercultural dynamics that are involved in those interactions. This article addresses these concerns by presenting a framework for the cultural analysis of discourse that has been presented and used in previous literature(e. g., Carbaugh, 1988 a, 1990, 2005; Carbaugh, Gibson, and Milburn, 1997). Indebted to the ethnography of communication (Hymes, 1972), and interpretive anthropology (Geertz, 1973), this particular analytic procedure is one implementation of the theory of communication codes (Carbaugh, 2005; Philipsen, 1997; Philipsen, Coutu, and Covarrubias, 2005). As such, it takes communication to be not only its primary data but moreover, its primary theoretical concern. The framework responds to specific research questions, addresses particular kinds of intellectual problems, includes five investigative modes, and uses a special set of concepts. In this essay, each of the modes is discussed as analytically distinct, yet as complementary to the others, including theoretical, descriptive, interpretive, comparative, and critical analyses. Special attention is given to the <b>interpretive</b> <b>mode</b> and to intercultural interactions as a site for the application and development of cultural discourse analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The idea {{of using}} sport for social, {{cultural}} and community development has been promoted for decades; however, only limited empirical research can be found that analyses the strategic potential of sport projects in contributing to conflict resolution, reconciliation and peace building in deeply divided societies. This study concentrates upon the experiences {{of a number of}} Football for Peace (F 4 P) projects operating in Israel in 2009. It identifies and investigates the inter-community sport management strategies employed in a particular project that featured Jewish, Arab, and Circassian communi-ties in Northern Israel. The article focuses on and assesses the role played by external change agents in facilitating project delivery and development. Following an <b>interpretive</b> <b>mode</b> of enquiry, observations and focus group discussions with key project facilitators and sport coaches were conducted exploring participant experiences and using this in-formation to develop practical recommendations for social development through sport. The following six strategic dimensions were elicited as critical elements for promoting positive inter-community relations, building local capacity and enhancing overall social development: greater emphasis on training for all volunteers; the provision of role model support; the development of local commitment and leadership; improvement of sport pro-gramming; the facilitation of wider community involvement; and project augmentation and extension. We argue that these practical suggestions have transferable implications for other grassroots organisations and NGOs that use sport projects in divided and/or disadvantaged communities elsewhere in the world...|$|E
40|$|Educational {{systems are}} {{continuing}} to prioritise the importance of technology in learning. Curriculum guidelines and frameworks from across the globe insist that all learning areas find ways to utilise appropriate technologies in the teaching learning process. Drama Education is one area where {{the use of technology}} seems to be quite limited. The study seeks to determine some emerging understanding of the perceptions and attitudes held by Drama teachers about the introduction of Interactive and Information Technology (Digital Environments) into classroom Drama practice. Of particular interest to this researcher is the seeming reluctance to engage with such technology. Drama educators from all levels of education were invited to complete the survey via email and the Drama Education: A Global Perspective website will contribute to the study. Since the study functions in an essentially <b>interpretive</b> and descriptive <b>mode</b> it was not expected that generalisations will be forthcoming, although there do emerge some relational understandings as well as implications and considerations for future introduction of so-called digital environments in Drama, and related issues such as resourcing, professional development, and pre-service training. Additionally, this study identifies areas of need and/or deficiency within school structures in relation to technology access and requirements for Drama educators. This is especially relevant to the Western Australian context as education sectors are engaged in curriculum improvement programs that necessitate cross-curricula and integrated practices...|$|R
40|$|The Socialist Republic of Vietnam {{committed}} to bring its laws, regulations and administrative procedures into conformity with the WTO rules-based trading agreements and to honour its obligations {{with respect to}} development {{of the rule of}} law. This study examines the areas of friction that Vietnam is likely to encounter as it implements the WTO legal regime. It hypothesised that a smooth transfer and adaptation of the Western-based customs regime requires Vietnamese recipients to understand and support principles of transparency and liberalisation of the WTO that differ from socialist principles underlying the Vietnameselegal system. Having adopted a social construction view, this study of national interpretation assumed that state actors of Vietnam were not passive receivers of the WTO customs rules but rather constructed the meaning given to the global rules. Discourse analysis was proved as the suitable methodology since Party and State’s understandings about the WTO customs regime were largely generated through communicative processes. The three streams of discourse <b>modes,</b> <b>interpretive</b> communities and discursive strategies were tested to assess the WTO-related regulatory conversations within and amongst groups of domestic implementers at different state levels: the Party and State’s high policy making, customs lawmaking central level, and the law implementation local level. The principal conclusion reached was that the transfer of WTO principal rules in Vietnam is difficult because political leaders, lawmakers and government officials at different state levels did not fully understand and interpret the WTO basic objectives. The domestic reforms toward the Western rule of law revealed the biggest complication of the prevailing socialist constraints of party leadership and power concentration. These political contradictions prevent the Party and State leaders to interpret the WTO principles of economic law and the liberalisation objectives that presented a slow shift from the Soviet-originated thinking of state economic management to the Western thinking of free market access. Another conclusion was that the Party and State’s interpretations of the WTO objectives shaped the Customs’ cognitive assumptions and allowed customs lawmakers and regulators to reinterpret and reformulate the WTO customs rules. The repetitive customs law making discourse did not result in a smooth transfer of the WTO-WCO customs rules because of the incompatible high political level thinking and the Customs’ reinterpretations and reformulation. The results also revealed that power structures and cognitive assumptions in Customs shaped the implementation of the imported customs regimes, especially when the WTO valuations rules were reinterpreted by customs regulators for the daily application. Though customs administrators and judges wanted to promote an effective and efficient customs administration to approach the WTO objectives, there still existed discrepancies in the administrative and judiciary interpretations of the WTO legality requirement...|$|R
40|$|In my dissertation, I examine upper {{secondary}} students’ discourses regarding fictional texts {{presented to them}} in the Norwegian classroom. The research topics are: By which cultural discourses/frameworks/codes/identities is meaning produced when students encounter academic content presented {{to them in the}} Norwegian class room? How are the fictional texts included in the students’ meaning making processes? Which consequences may different cultural discourses/frameworks have for students’ experiences with the fictional texts? In my sociocultural and phenomenological approach, the research topics are examined from the perspectives of linguistic research and literature research. In other words, I consider both the readers’ interpretation of the texts and language used in the discourse; both what is said and how it is said. The research data consist of transcribed recorded interviews with 21 students in {{upper secondary}} school, five interviews with each student. The students come from different cultural backgrounds, ten of them have Norwegian background and 11 of them have backgrounds form different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and South-America. The first interview investigates the informants’ preunderstanding, their attitude towards school, academic content, as well as other social arenas outside school. The next four interviews address texts from different literary periods: the Enlightenment, The modern breakthrough, psychoanalysis in the 20 s and 30 s and feminism in the 70 s and 80 s. The most important finding of this dissertation is the great diversity of the group. Diversity among students is a well-documented phenomenon in quantitative studies, but this dissertation points to the nature of this diversity, particularly regarding meta-language. This diversity is described as a continuum between student identities including language, which mediates affinity at the one end and students who relate to school, texts and other academic content through meta-cognition and metalanguage at the other end. Students of both genders and different cultural backgrounds are to be found {{at both ends of the}} continuum. Furthermore, the findings point to a great complexity within identities at both ends of the continuum, a complexity that is often under-communicated in pedagogical research. This complexity reveals among other aspects a frequent discontinuity between loyalty to outer (questions of more disciplinary nature) and inner (academic content) conditions of school. Furthermore, the findings show a close link between meta-language and learning modes. Language is therefore regarded as the key factor for learning in this dissertation. The purpose of the first interview was to investigate the informants’ pre-understanding. The informants were for instance asked to talk about texts they had read in Norwegian at any earlier point in their school biographies. Out of 21 informants, only four could remember particular texts, while all could tell about a favorite film. The informants’ stories about films reveal why the fictional texts were hard to remember. In order to make sense in a text, there is a need for context and coherence. The films, in contrast to the fictional text, fulfill both conditions. Regarding context, the films (with one exception, “American blockbusters”) communicate values that the students recognize, both when it comes to gender ideology and the strong belief in the individual’s capacity to make autonomous choices. These ideologies are prominent discourses in the informants’ self-presentation; the films and the informants see the world through the same ideologies, and the films confirm values that the informants recognize. In other words, the contexts of the films are the same as the informants’ contexts. Secondly, the films represent narrative units with a beginning, middle and end. The tradition of using excerpts of fictional texts is prominent in Norwegian texts books. This reduces the coherence and complicates the relationship between the reader and the text. When, in addition, the context does not confirm what the reader already knows, the meaning-making process is made difficult in the students’ encounters with the texts. The ideology referred to as the ethics of the autonomous individual is further investigated in four chapters of the dissertation. This ideology is prominent in all the informants’ self-presentation. They all believe that their life prospects and opportunities depend solely on themselves; that they have free choice, and if they work hard, they will achieve their goals in life. This discourse is projected on to the academic content, both on to their account of Norway’s historic development and on to the fictional texts. Norway’s history from the Enlightenment and forth is presented as a narrative about a steadfast, continuous development towards increased individual freedom and a society governed by reason, a narrative that is “crowned” with a happy ending: the informants’ own freedom of choice. Their self-image as autonomous individuals is also projected on to the fictional texts. This produces plausible readings of texts from Realism, texts that highlight personal choices and the characters’ struggle to become independent individuals. There are less plausible readings of Naturalistic texts that emphasize determinism, and psychoanalytic texts that highlight the individual’s lack of control. The findings of the four chapters have two important didactic implications. Firstly, both in the European Bildung tradition and the more recent American literacy tradition, fictional texts are regarded as didactic tools for expanding students’ thinking; their ability to enter into new contexts and to discover other perspectives than their own. The ability to understand, interpret, create, and use written material associated with various contexts is the central skill described in UNESCO’s definition of literacy. The inflexibility regarding the use and understanding of other contexts than one’s own here-and-now is particularly perceptible at the affinity end of the continuum. This indicates a literacy problem at this end of the continuum. Historical readings of fictional texts challenge the ability to enter into new contexts. This is evident at the end of the continuum where the informants encounter the text with a meta-perspective. These readers take the historical context into account when they interpret the texts, and by this they exceed their own her-and-now perspective when reading. This dissertation indicates a need to reinforce historical readings as a mean to increase students’ ability to use and understand text in context. Secondly, there is no scientific evidence that the autonomous individual exists. Instead the idea of the autonomous individual seems to function as a cultural tool for harmonization. Social sciences indicate that children from middle-class homes are freer in the sense that they have greater opportunity to succeed in the school system, and therefore in their professional careers. Critical voices in the informants’ discourses would therefore be expected, but the strong belief in their own opportunity to act on free choice, seem to harmonize potential criticism. In the dissertation’s selection all informants seem to have taken over the middle-class’ belief in this kind of freedom. There seems to be a surprising match between the continuum and the categories “non-reader” and “reader”. The self-proclaimed “non-readers” often use language that mediates affinity and feelings when talking about the text. This language gives little access to new contexts and <b>interpretive</b> <b>modes.</b> These student identities have less mediated actions than the “readers”; they have less explanations of why they are supposed to read fictional texts, they give few interpretations of the texts and the films, they don’t see the texts as relevant to their own social arena. They present few arguments and explanations, and there are few examples of explicit reasoning in their discourse. Instead of arguments, their reactions to the academic content are justified in an emotional language and the distinctions used for evaluating school are the same as when evaluating other social arenas. School does not appear as an arena for learning for the identities at the affinity end. The most frequent distinctions for evaluating school and academic content is “boring” and “fun”. “The readers” approach the subject content as well as the films with meta-language that give access to new contexts and they show an ability to use these contexts when interpreting the texts. At this end of the continuum, frequent distinctions are “interesting-uninteresting”, “important – not important”, “relevant – not relevant”. Altogether, this suggests a different learning mode at the different ends of the continuum. The empirical data brought forth by this project show that students of different genders and cultural diverse backgrounds are to be found at both ends of the continuum, an indication that “all” students are part of the same discursive problem area; the question of access to different aspects of metalanguage. This access seems to be vital for learning. Recent studies on this access indicate that metalanguage is a matter of social class. The empirical data give little information on the informants’ social background, but there are indications that several of the informants who approach academic content with meta-perspectives have parents of higher education. This dissertation promotes the idea that meta-language must be a central feature of vocational training, and also that Norwegian as a school subject has a particular responsibility for the training of such levels of discourse. The students with a rich meta-language have the ability to create versions of the “world”, of the films and the texts that they can give grounds for and explain. This is not possible through a language that mediates feelings and affinity. Meta-language must therefore be regarded as a more powerful symbolic system, a system that mother-tongue teachers have a particular responsibility for developing in order to create equal opportunities for children and adolescents...|$|R
