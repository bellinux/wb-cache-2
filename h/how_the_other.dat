5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file temporally. To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable temporally to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

25|$|In 1887, {{flash powder}} was invented, {{enabling}} journalists such as Jacob Riis to photograph informal subjects indoors, {{which led to}} the landmark work <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> Half Lives.

25|$|The {{fact that}} three bullets were found inside Baader's cell is {{considered}} suspicious. The first explanation given was that Baader signaled the other prisoners.

25|$|Criticism of garment sweatshops {{became a}} major force behind {{workplace}} safety regulation and labor laws. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term sweatshop came {{to refer to a}} broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, investigative journalists, known as muckrakers, wrote exposés of business practices, and progressive politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable exposés of sweatshop conditions include Jacob Riis' photo documentary <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> Half Lives and Upton Sinclair's book, The Jungle, about the meat packing industry.|$|E

25|$|<b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> Half Lives sold {{well and}} was much quoted. Reviews were {{generally}} good, although some reviewers criticized it for oversimplifying and exaggerating. Riis attributed the success {{to a popular}} interest in social amelioration stimulated by William Booth's In Darkest England and the Way Out, and also to Ward McAllister's Society as I Have Found It, {{a portrait of the}} moneyed class. The book encouraged imitations such as Darkness and Daylight; or, Lights and Shadows of New York Life (1892), which somehow appropriated Riis's own photographs.|$|E
25|$|Riis emphatically {{supported}} {{the spread of}} wealth to lower classes through improved social programs and philanthropy, but his personal opinion of the natural causes for poor immigrants' situations tended to display {{the trappings of a}} racist ideology. Several chapters of <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> Half Lives for example, open with Riis' observations of the economic and social situations of different ethnic and racial groups via indictments of their perceived natural flaws; often prejudices that may well have been informed by scientific racism.|$|E

The relationship factor involves characteristics that describe {{the relationship between the two}} individuals. These factors include the degree of familiarity, liking, attraction, or similarity. The context feature involves aspects like the environment and the situations the individuals are in such as privacy, formality, and task oriented. These situations either enhance or diminish the interaction on the date and help maintain and structure individual’s goals.|$|E

25|$|Color performance: There are {{multiple}} terms to describe {{different aspects of}} color performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. Color gamut is a relatively straight forward feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has no benefits, so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> colors are displayed relative to white.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} Riis's {{autobiography}} {{lies in the}} description of his origins as a social reformer. His early experiences in Ribe gave Riis a yardstick with which to measure tenement dwellers’ quality of life. The account of the development of his powers of observation through his experiences as a poor immigrant lent authenticity to his news articles and larger works. Its themes about self-sufficiency, perseverance, and material success are prime examples of an archetype that successful Europeans like Riis used to demonstrate the exceptional opportunities that seem to exist only in the United States. In spite of its triumphalist outlook, The Making of an American remains useful as a source for students of immigration history and sociology who {{want to learn more about}} the author of <b>How</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> Half Lives and the social reform movement that he helped to define.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent report}} {{has shown that}} the initial {{interaction}} between TRAPP and the ER derived vesicle is mediated via the interaction between the TRAPP subunit Bet3 and the COPII coat subunit, Sec23. The conventional view of tethering/fusion assumed that the vesicle coat is shed prior to tethering and fusion but this report argues for a model where the initial tethering step takes place on a coated or partially coated vesicle. The TRAPPI complex minus the subunit Trs85 was recently crystallized as two subcomplexes that were then modelled on EM etch data to reveal a possible crystal structure for the entire complex. A putative ypt/rab binding site was indicated on the crystal structure involving the subunits Trs23 and Bet5. Incidentally, all 5 essential small subunits (Trs31, Trs20, Bet3, Bet5 and Trs23) are required to reconstitute efficient exchange activity on ypt1 in vitro. Therefore, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the interface between ypt1 and TRAPPI is only confined to Trs23 and Bet5 and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> subunit influence exchange activity.|$|E
50|$|It {{might be}} {{expected}} intuitively that Pirate A will have to offer <b>the</b> <b>other</b> pirates {{with most of the}} gold to increase the chances of his plan being accepted. However, this is quite far from the theoretical result. When each of the pirates votes they won't just be thinking about the current proposal, but all <b>other</b> outcomes down <b>the</b> line. Also because the order of seniority is known in advance, each of them can accurately predict <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> might vote in any scenario.|$|R

It's about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> people they've met in the city have helped them—you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists.
