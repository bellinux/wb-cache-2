50|$|The MiG-31 was {{equipped}} with RK-RLDN and APD-518 <b>digital</b> <b>secure</b> datalinks. The RK-RLDN datalink is for communication with ground control centers. The APD-518 datalink enables a flight of four MiG-31 to automatically exchange radar-generated data within 200 km (124 mi) from each other. It also enables other aircraft with less sophisticated avionics, such as MiG-23,25,29/Su-15,27 to be directed to targets spotted by MiG-31 (a maximum of 4 (long-range) for each MiG-31 aircraft). The A-50 AEW aircraft and MiG-31 can automatically exchange aerial and terrestrial radar target designation, as well as air defense.|$|E

The APD-518 datalink enables a flight of four MiG-31 to automatically exchange radar-generated data within 200 km (124 mi) from each other (a group of four MiG-31 interceptors is able to control an area of air space across a total length of 800 km). It also enables other aircraft with less sophisticated avionics, such as MiG-23,25,29/Su - 15,27 to be directed to targets spotted by MiG-31 (a maximum of 4 (long-range) for each MiG-31 aircraft). Similarly to complex S-300 aircraft group with APD-518 can: share data obtained by various radars from different directions (active or passive scanning of radiation) and summarize the data. That is, the target can be detected passively (through noise posed to protect themselves / active search radar (target)) and (or) actively simultaneously from many different directions (active search radar of MiG-31). And everyone aircraft has APD-518 will have exact data, {{even if it is}} not involved in the search.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to real-time <b>digital</b> <b>secure</b> speech commu-nication is proposed based on the inversion theory of nonlin-ear discrete-time dynamical systems. The proposed approach uses an observable minimal-phase nonlinear discrete-time dynamical system, particularly with chaotic zero-dynamics, as the drive system to generate encrypted message signals for transmission. The receiver is the minimal left-inverse sys-tem of the drive system with the capability of synchroniza-tion. The receiver decrypts the received signal, recovers the original message in real-time. The effectiveness of the pro-posed approach and design is demonstrated via several ex-amples for secure speech signals transmission. Performance evaluation of the designed secure communication system is discussed. Both analysis and simulation show that the new scheme is secure, simple, accurate and robust. 1...|$|E
