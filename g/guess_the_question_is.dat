You can't make an excuse for things that happened, but the majority of people that actually died in the Civil War on the Confederate side did not own slaves.

40|$|A {{criminal}} history may provide more clues about future serious crime {{than has been}} appreciated in the past. Evidence of routine and low tariff crime have long been good predictors of future crime. The focus in predicting reconviction has been largely {{on the amount of}} crime that has been committed. An analysis of research encourages the notion that the type of crime that has been committed is also important in understanding the likelihood of future serious crime. Trying to probe the likely effect of changes of societal response to serious sexual assault by considering hypothetical models is a way forward to the challenge ahead of rethinking sexual crimes. It demonstrates that, as the reporting of serious sexual assault increases, the conviction rate needs to rise markedly to conquer a general feeling that matters are deteriorating rather than improving. The rise needed is much greater than most would have <b>guessed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether <b>the</b> criminal careers of most sex offenders are really as short as some of the research suggests. The possible value of developing a social laboratory in a local area is suggested in order to begin to understand the changes {{over long periods of time}} in sex offenses. The dangers of “criminal apartheid” are highlighted. The major point is that there is still much to learn about sex crime. Ideas are developed following a systematic study of sex crime in one town, Lancaster, in the northwest of England, derived from the search of the local newspaper over a period of 120 years, 1860 through 1979. 14 notes, 4 figures, 13 reference...|$|R

At that moment the {{appearance}} of Flora could not but bring the tension to the breaking point. She came out in all innocence but not without vague dread. Anthony's exclamation on first seeing Powell had reached her in her cabin, where, it seems, she was brushing her hair. She had heard the very words. `What are you doing here?' And the unwonted loudness of the voice--his voice--breaking the habitual stillness of that hour would have startled a person having much less reason to be constantly apprehensive, than the captive of Anthony's masterful generosity. She had no means to <b>guess</b> to whom <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>was</b> addressed and it echoed in her heart, as Anthony's voice always did. Followed complete silence. She waited, anxious, expectant, till she could stand the strain no longer, and with the weary mental appeal of the overburdened. `My God! What is it now?' {{she opened the door}} of her room and looked into the saloon. Her first glance fell on Powell. For a moment, seeing only the second officer with Anthony, she felt relieved and made as if to draw back; but her sharpened perception detected something suspicious in their attitudes, and she came forward slowly.|$|R
5000|$|On November 21, 2011, {{members of}} Occupy Charlottesville {{expressed}} {{their intention to}} continue their occupation to Charlottesville City Council. Many asked for the City to suspend the 11 p.m. curfew. Over 100 supporters packed the chambers in what Councilor David Brown called the best-attended meeting in his 8 years on the board. An overflow room was opened for people who could not fit in council chambers. About 60 people spoke to City Council regarding Occupy Charlottesville, a handful of them against its continued presence. Councilor response followed the public comments portion of the meeting. During this response portion of the meeting Councilor Szakos stated that she [...] "thinks that free speech doesn't expire at 11 o'clock. It doesn't expire at Thanksgiving." [...] Szakos was the sole councilor in favor of allowing the occupation to continue in Lee Park despite complaints by {{some members of the}} neighborhood. The rest of the council was in favor of the continuation of Occupy Charlottesville, albeit not in Lee Park. A desire was expressed to move the occupation to a new location, approved by the local city government. Mayor Dave Norris expressed his desire to find an alternative location for the occupiers other than a [...] "neighborhood park". Although he expressed general support for the movement, he was resolved to end the Lee Park encampment. [...] "I <b>guess</b> for me, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> movement stronger than this park? I think it is. I think it's clear that it is".|$|R
40|$|Key words: SQ 3 R Technique, Students’ Reading Achievement. 	One of the {{techniques}} used in teaching reading is SQ 3 R. SQ 3 R is a reading strategy {{that can be used}} when students are expected to read and remember content material. It is a method for studying text and this strategy has five Steps: Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review. For survey step, students survey the whole text in order to know roughly what the text tells about. While, for <b>the</b> <b>question</b> step <b>is</b> students will <b>question</b> themselves or create <b>the</b> <b>question</b> by themselves from the reading text that they have just surveyed. They will <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that <b>are</b> commonly asked by the writer and keep <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in their mind or they can write {{on a piece of paper}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that they have created. The next step is that the students should read the text carefully in order to have a good comprehension of the reading text. The fourth step is to recite. In this step, the students should retell the material they have just read in order to have a better understanding. The final step is to review; the writer will ask the student’s to review the reading text in order to have a better overview of what they have learnt. In this last step, the students make conclusions or summaries of the reading text. 	The formulation of this thesis is: 1) How is students’ reading achievement before being taught by SQ 3 R technique? 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after being taught by SQ 3 R technique? 3) Is there any different score between Students’ Reading Achievement before and after teaching using SQ 3 R technique? 	The purpose the study is: 1) To find out the students’ reading achievement before taught by SQ 3 R technique, 2) To find out the students’ reading achievement after taught by SQ 3 R technique, 3) To find out significant different scores before and after taught by SQ 3 R technique, The research design was experimental research using quantitative approach. The population is all students of the eighth grade that is 41 students. Here, the researcher uses 21 students from A class as a sample research. The research instrument to collect data is test and to measure the different score before and after taught by using SQ 3 R technique is using t-test. The result showed that the students’ reading score before being taught by using SQ 3 R technique was 64. While the score after being taught by using SQ 3 R technique was 91. The T count was 10. 254, whereas the T table with significance level 5...|$|R
