Inheritance, in all its forms, plays an important part in achieving greater reuse, at all stages of development.

At the design level, such hierarchies are augmented with <b>implementation</b> <b>classes,</b> and possibly reorganized to take into account implementation factors such as performance or code reuse [22]. Getting the analysis-level hierarchy "right" is very important for the understandability and traceability of the models and the reusability of the resulting code [22].

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a realization}} of object persistence in a CORBA-based distributed system. In our approach, persistence of CORBA objects {{is accomplished by}} {{the integration of the}} ORB with an ODBMS. This approach is not limited to pure object-oriented database systems, as the ODBMS may be a combination of a relational DBMS and an object-relational mapper. The design and implementation of an Object Database Adapter that integrates an ORB and an ODBMS with C++ bindings is presented. The ODA uses delegation (rather than inheritance) to connect user-provided <b>implementation</b> <b>classes</b> and IDL-generated classes. Only the user-defined parts of CORBA objects are actually stored in a database. Their IDL-generated parts are dynamically instantiated, in transient memory, by the ODA. Persistent relationships between CORBA objects within a server are not realized at the CORBA level, but at the level of implementation objects. Database traversals and queries can therefore be executed at ODBMS speeds. The paper discusses in some detail a number of implementation issues, such as caching. ODA support to local transactions, ODA interfaces, and CORBA server organization are also examined. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{object-oriented}} {{paradigm is}} becoming very popular for database applications and several object-oriented DBMSs have been developed. A basic notion in this paradigm is the inheritance hierarchy {{that allows the}} users to define objects and the associated operations starting from already defined objects. However, in database applications the inheritance hierarchy must provide a conceptual modeling function, {{in addition to the}} re-usability function. Another important requirement is to provide support for data distribution in (possibly) heterogeneous environments. This means that object implementation may differ depending on the object location. This paper presents a model that decouples these two aspects, modeling vs implementation, by using the concept of abstract and <b>implementation</b> <b>classes.</b> An abstract class specifies properties and methods for a set of similar objects, like in other object-oriented data models. An abstract class is however independent of the object implementation and location. An implementation class defines the implementation of an abstract class. In our model an abstract class may have several implementations. This allows the user to provide different implementations for the same set of objects, without requiring the objects to change class...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Trace {{links between}} {{requirements}} and code {{are essential for}} many software development and maintenance activities. Despite significant advances in traceability research, creating links remains a human-intensive activity and surprisingly {{little is known about}} how humans perform basic tracing tasks. We investigate fundamental research questions regarding the effort and quality of recovering traces between requirements and code. Our paper presents two exploratory experiments conducted with 100 subjects (half with industrial experience, the other half without) who recovered trace links for two open source software systems in a controlled environment and cast over 125. 000 votes. In the first experiment, subjects recovered trace links between the two systems ’ requirements and <b>implementation</b> <b>classes.</b> In the second experiment trace links were established between requirements and implementation methods. In order to assess the validity of the trace links cast by subjects, key developers of the two software systems participated in our research and provided benchmarks. Our study yields surprising observations: trace capture is surprisingly fast and can be done within minutes even for larger classes; the quality of the captured trace links, while good, does not improve with higher trace effort; it is not harder though slightly more expensive to recover the trace links for larger, more complex classes; and, trace capture should be performed by multiple engineers because “hard-to-do ” traces differed per subject and were not uniform to certain parts of code. These findings open interesting possibilities for future research...|$|E

40|$|Implementing a {{concurrent}} {{data structure}} typically begins with defining its sequential specification. However, when used as is, a nontrivial sequential data structure, {{such as a}} linked list, a search tree, or a hash table, may expose incorrect behavior: lost updates, inconsistent responses, etc. To ensure correctness, portions of the sequential code operating on the shared data must be "protected" from data races using synchronization primitives and, thus, certain schedules of the steps of concurrent operations must be rejected. But can we ensure {{that we do not}} "overuse" synchronization, i. e., that we reject a concurrent schedule only if it violates correctness? In this paper, we treat this question formally by introducing the notion of a concurrency-optimal implementation. A program's concurrency is defined here as its ability to accept concurrent schedules, i. e., interleavings of steps of its sequential implementation. An implementation is concurrency-optimal if it accepts all interleavings that do not violate the program's correctness. We explore the concurrency properties of search data structures which can be represented in the form of directed acyclic graphs exporting insert, delete and search operations. We prove, for the first time, that pessimistic e. g., based on conservative locking) and optimistic serializable e. g., based on serializable transactional memory) implementations of search data-structures are incomparable in terms of concurrency. Specifically, there exist simple interleavings of sequential code that cannot be accepted by any pessimistic (and resp., serializable optimistic) implementation, but accepted by a serializable optimistic one (and resp., pessimistic). Thus, neither of these two <b>implementation</b> <b>classes</b> is concurrency-optimal. Comment: Extended version of results in arXiv: 1203. 475...|$|E
40|$|The {{scheduling}} {{of tasks}} in real-time, resource-constrained embedded systems is typically performed using a simple scheduler. Scheduling algorithm is the key scheduler component which determines {{the way in which}} tasks can be executed to meet their timing constraints. To ensure precise task scheduling, the right decisions about the scheduler implementation have to be made. It has been argued that there is a wide gap between scheduling theory and its practical implementation which must be bridged to achieve a meaningful validation of embedded systems. The work described in this thesis attempts to address this gap by proposing a simple (generic) technique, called the Scheduler Test Case (STC), which provides the facility to explore how a particular real-time scheduler implementation can be expected to behave under a range of both normal and abnormal operating conditions. The primary focus of this thesis is on single-processor embedded systems employing Time-Triggered Co-operative (TTC) architectures. The technique proposed is a testing method which helps facilitate an empirical “black-box” comparison between the behaviour of a set of representative <b>implementation</b> <b>classes</b> of the TTC scheduling algorithm. The key criterion against which scheduler behaviour is weighed up is the system predictability manifested by predictable task execution sequence, low timing jitter and unplanned error handling capabilities. The implementation costs (including CPU, memory and power requirements) involved in creating each scheduler are also considered for distinguishing between the different TTC implementations. The STC technique is then extended to provide a practical means for assessing the behaviour of multi-processor embedded designs employing Shared-Clock (S-C) scheduling architectures and TTC algorithm on the Controller Area Network (CAN) hardware protocol. In this part of the study, the STC technique explores the impact of using particular implementations of the S-C scheduler on the overall timing behaviour of multi-processor embedded systems. In addition to jitter behaviour which is measured empirically, the STC evaluates the communication behaviour by assessing the message latencies between any two communicating nodes in the network and the time frame required by the network to detect a temporary node failure. The results are expressed using mathematical equations. Moreover, the implementation costs (including network utilisation and memory overheads) are also considered to differentiate between the compared S-C schedulers. The thesis finally concludes by discussing the overall findings of this project and making some proposals for future work in the area concerned with in the project.
