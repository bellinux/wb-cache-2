25|$|Nelson {{accepted}} Hoste to {{join him}} as a captain's servant on , which he boarded at Portsmouth {{at the end of}} April 1793. The ship joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Hood, and it was in the Mediterranean and Adriatic that Hoste saw most of his naval service. Extracts from Nelson's letters to his wife mention Hoste frequently; for example: ‘without exception one of the finest boys <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> with’ and ‘his gallantry never can be exceeded, and each day rivets him stronger to my heart’. Another captain's servant on Agamemnon was Josiah Nisbet, Nelson's stepson, but the letters suggest that Hoste quickly became a favourite and that Josiah compared badly with him in many respects. Hoste was promoted to midshipman by Nelson on 1 February 1794 and served with him during the blockade of and subsequent assault on Corsica on 7 February.|$|E

In 1954 he wanted to {{interview}} the French prime minister, Pierre Mendès-France, and approached the novelist François Mauriac, a friend of Mendès-France, for an introduction. He writes: [...] "The problem was that [...] {{was in love with}} Jesus. He was the most decent person <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in that field... and {{he was in love with}} Jesus.... Whatever I would ask– Jesus. Finally, I said, 'What about Mendès-France?' He said that Mendès-France, like Jesus, was suffering..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} 17 {{games of the}} 1890 season, Dunlap's batting average fell to [...]172, {{and as a result}} he was {{released}} by the Alleghenies on May 15. Aside from his batting average, disagreements with Pittsburgh's manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. The Pittsburgh Dispatch quoted manager Hecker as saying, [...] "Dunlap is certainly the worst man to get along with that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> He has had everybody in hot water during our entire western trip." [...] Others speculated that Dunlap's release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh's backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only $1,050.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Parsons {{also wrote}} {{an essay on}} his individualist {{philosophy}} and politics—which he described as standing for [...] "liberalism and liberal principles"—titled [...] "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword", in which he condemned the authoritarianism, censorship, corruption, antisexualism and racism he saw as prevalent in American society. None of these works were published in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons received a visit from writer L. Sprague de Camp, with whom he discussed magic and science fiction, and disclosed that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later referred to Parsons as [...] "An authentic mad genius if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> one", and based the character Courtney James on him in his time travel story A Gun for Dinosaur (1956). Parsons was also visited by Jane Wolfe, who unsuccessfully appealed for him to rejoin the dilapidated O.T.O. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house on Redondo Beach, a building known by them as the [...] "Concrete Castle". Cameron returned to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and violently argued with Parsons upon discovering his infidelity, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons responded by initiating divorce proceedings against her {{on the grounds of}} [...] "extreme cruelty".|$|E

Asquith called {{him one of the}} three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A. J. P.

[...] In 1904, heavyweight boxing champion [...] "Gentlemen Jim" [...] Corbett agreed to a three-round bout with Shevlin at the Yale gymnasium. [...] Corbett won the match, but praised Shevlin afterward: [...] "He hits the hardest blow and is the best man at foot work <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> {{with the exception of}} [...] Jeffries." [...] Some in the press expressed concern that Shevlin had taken up a sport that was uncommon in the Ivy League and wondered whether [...] "society will drop" [...] Shevlin [...] "because he has been taking to the gloves." ...|$|E

[...] – as he sought to impose his views of the emerging power of the aeroplane on the Armed Forces and the Government.

[...] In wiring of this incident in his autobiography, published in 1879, Cody whimsically remarked: [...] "Jack Crawford is the only man I have ever known that could have brought that bottle of whiskey through without [...] "accident befalling it, for {{he is one of}} the very few teetotal scouts <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> [...] Indeed, Crawford made a good impression upon both officers and enlisted men, who considered his ride from Fetterman a [...] "plucky undertaking."" ...|$|E

2500|$|Codreanu had an {{enduring}} influence in Italy. His views and style were attested to {{have influenced the}} controversial Traditionalist philosopher and racial theorist Julius Evola. Evola himself met with Codreanu on one occasion, and, {{in the words of}} his friend, the writer and historian Mircea Eliade, was [...] "dazzled". Reportedly, the visit had been arranged by Eliade and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu, both of whom sympathized with the Iron Guard. Their guest later wrote that the Iron Guard founder was: [...] "one of the worthiest and spiritually best oriented figures that <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in the nationalist movements of the time." [...] According to De Felice, Codreanu has also become a main reference point for the Italian neofascist groups, alongside Evola and the ideologues of Nazism. He argues that this phenomenon, which tends to shadow references to Italian Fascism itself, is owed to Mussolini's failures in setting up [...] "a true fascist state", and to the subsequent need of finding other role models. Evola's disciple and prominent neofascist activist Franco Freda published several of Codreanu's essays at his Edizioni di Ar, while their follower Claudio Mutti was noted for his pro-Legionary rhetoric.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Riipinen was {{suspended}} from the parliament for insulting {{the speaker of the}} parliament for a week. She became a well-known figure and was mockingly called the [...] "enfant terrible of the parliament". Social democrat Karl-August Fagerholm said of her: [...] "Riipinen was the most fanatical politician <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> And since that political person is a woman, there are no limits or borders to that fanaticism". Such was her fanaticism that in 1937 she publicly repudiated Finland's Independence Day, refusing to participate in the national celebrations as she believed it had become too [...] "socialist". She was motivated in this belief {{by the fact that the}} Social Democrats had become junior partners in a coalition government, although the pronouncement alienated the far-right further and they came under attack in the liberal press for their nationalist posturing whilst refusing to celebrate Independence Day. In another instance in 1934 Riipinen sponsored a petitionary motion in parliament to bring in a law calling for the compulsory castration of men convicted of child molestation. Riipinen managed to gain the support of party colleagues Bruno Salmiala and Eino Tuomivaara for this motion.|$|E
2500|$|Music writer Richard Goldstein related his {{impression}} of Wilson {{based on a}} meeting in 1967: [...] "I've read monographs on the Beach Boys that describe Wilson as a self-conscious artist, fully aware of musical history. That [...] wasn't my impression. He came across as a typical rock autodidact, deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs {{he was working on}} were too arty to sell." [...] According to Van Dyke Parks, Wilson was a highly innovative songwriter, but it was a [...] "mistake" [...] to call him a genius. In Parks' opinion, Harry Nilsson [...] "was truly a genius-- the smartest guy <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in the music business. ... He followed his own nose without any sense of apology, reserving even the right to be wrong because he knew that it was necessary to keep that right to reach any height." [...] By the 1980s, Wilson was paying his psychologist Eugene Landy a salary of about $300,000 a year for advice on creative decisions. Wilson's family subsequently alleged that Landy was [...] "unduly" [...] influencing him in personal and financial matters, and in response, California courts enacted a restraining order between the two.|$|E

2500|$|Irvine met John Long, a Methodist colporteur, in March 1897 in Kilrush, S. Ireland. [...] "At this time, Irvine {{had a big}} {{reputation}} as a Faith Mission evangelist [...] "remarkable for saying, 'Praise the Lord,' no matter what happened". [...] John Long describes Irvine as [...] "In either secular or religious matters, he was a born leader of men; he was a holy man, and practical. In personal dealing, he was preeminently the best conversationalist <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met,</b> and skilful in soul winning. He had a marvelous insight into the deep things of God's word, and like his Master, was an apt teacher of all who received the truth with pleasure. He always set forth the cross, and was a swift witness against all pride, vainglory and hypocrisy; he was severe on Christians, but merciful to sinners. In prayer, praise, and preaching he excelled in joy, liberty, and power. He was very much opposed and misunderstood by religious people; nevertheless, the common people liked him and heard him gladly." [...] Other sources describe Irvine's style of speaking as hypnotic, [...] "sweeter than honey in the honeycomb" [...] and [...] "ferocious" [...] in its sincerity. He was also noted for making outrageous and inflammatory statements, even claiming [...] "I am St. Paul the Second!" ...|$|E
