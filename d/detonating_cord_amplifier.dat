5000|$|The {{next step}} in mining {{technology}} was <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> Ensign-Bickford and other companies developed different versions of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> In 1937, Ensign-Bickford trademarked [...] "Primacord" [...] , which became the functional generic name for <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> in North America. In May 2003, Ensign-Bickford sold the trademarks and processes to Dyno Nobel Inc [...] of Australia (formerly of Norway).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Detonating</b> <b>cord</b> {{is rated}} in {{explosive}} mass per unit length. This {{is expressed in}} grains per foot in the United States, or in grams per metre elsewhere. A [...] "grams per metre" [...] rating will be roughly one fifth the [...] "grains per foot" [...] rating. For example, [...] "50 grain det. cord" [...] refers to <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> which has 50 grains of explosive per foot of length—or approximately 10 g/m. This is a typical [...] "default" [...] rating for connecting charges for blasting; lighter <b>detonating</b> <b>cords</b> {{may be used for}} [...] "low noise blasting" [...] and movie special effects, while heavier cords, used where the cord is employed to have some direct explosive effect—such as for precision rock carving work—may use 50 to 250 grain/foot (10 to 50 g/m) <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|R
50|$|Primacord is a {{brand of}} <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> used in blasting. The {{registered}} trademark Primacord was originally owned by the Ensign-Bickford Company; Ensign-Bickford sold the trademark to Dyno Nobel in 2003, who manufacture it in their Graham, Kentucky factory. The name is also used as a genericized trademark for any <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|R
50|$|Low-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> {{can be used}} as a {{precision}} cutting charge to remove cables, pipes, wiring, fiber optics, and other utility bundles by placing one or more complete wraps around the target. Detonation cord is used in commercial boilers to break up clinkers (solidified coal ash slag) adhering to tube structures. Also a vertical centered cord being lowered into the water of a drilled well can remove any clogging that obstructs water flow. Higher-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> can be used to cut down small trees, although the process is very uneconomical compared to using bulk explosive, or even a chainsaw. High-yield <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> placed by divers has been used to remove old dock pilings and other underwater obstructions. Creating a slipknot from <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> yields a field-improvised device that can be quickly employed to cut a locked doorknob off a door. Detonation cord can be taped in several rings to the outline of a military man-sized target and detonated, breaching a man-sized hole into wooden doors or light interior walls. <b>Detonating</b> <b>cord</b> is also employed directly in building demolition where thin concrete slabs need be broken via channels drilled parallel to the surface, an advantage over dynamite since a lower minimum of explosive force may be used and smaller diameter holes are sufficient to contain the explosive. Anything much more substantial than these uses requires the use of additional explosives.|$|R
50|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient. Such expedients are constructed from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades triggered electrically or by lengths of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> Some designs use lengths of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> or blasting caps to rupture the fuel container {{as well as}} detonate the main charge. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam wars {{as well as other}} conflicts.|$|R
5000|$|The MRUD {{is usually}} command {{actuated}} by electric detonator, {{but it can}} also be set up for tripwire actuation. In Bosnia and Croatia it was combined with a PMA-2 blast type anti-personnel mine by inserting one end of a length of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> in the detonator cavity of the MRUD and taping the other end of the <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> to the bottom of the PMA-2. When the blast mine actuated, the MRUD was actuated as well.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{control of}} {{underwater}} explosions is an industrial concern. In this paper, {{a comparison of}} experimental and numerical results of high-pressure generation using underwater explosion of spiral <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> is presented. To demonstrate that the converging process of underwater shock wave yields high pressure near the spiral center, the experimental investigation aims to compare underwater shock wave pressures obtained with several <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> geometrical configurations and study the wave converging process for a spiral cord. Because the experimental approach of these fast transient events is expensive and time-consuming, numerical simulations of experimental cases by using multi-material Eulerian formulation are carried out. The multi-material Eulerian, which is a particular multi-material ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) formulation was successfully used in many industrial applications involving computational fluid dynamic problems. By using an explicit finite element method, a good agreement between numerical and experimental results will valid multi-material Eulerian formulation abilities to solve accurately underwater shock wave problems for spiral <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> in various shapes...|$|R
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord.</b> In some designs, <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|R
5000|$|The M112 {{demolition}} {{blocks of}} C-4 are commonly manufactured into the M183 [...] "demolition charge assembly", {{which consists of}} 16 M112 block demolition charges and four priming assemblies packaged inside military Carrying Case M85. The M183 is used to breach obstacles or demolish large structures where larger satchel charges are required. Each priming assembly includes a five- or twenty-foot length of <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> assembled with <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> clips and capped at each end with a booster. When the charge is detonated, the explosive is converted into compressed gas. The gas exerts pressure {{in the form of}} a shock wave, which demolishes the target by cutting, breaching, or cratering.|$|R

40|$|Contour {{blasting}} {{is commonly}} performed by employing linear charges, decoupled from the boreholes. This method {{is common in}} surface and underground excavations, either for civil or mining purposes. To achieve the best results in terms of rock breakage and respect of the excavation profile, blasting theory suggests that charges should be inserted coaxial to the holes to grant uniform distribution of the explosive energy and therefore obtaining a uniform Radius of Damage. Nonetheless, due to readiness of operations or lack of availability of specific products on the market, non-coaxial charges are often employed in blasting practice. Non-coaxial charging methods include the employ of high-power <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> (40 to 100 g/m), low-power <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> connecting small-diameter cartridges (commonly 10 g/m <b>detonating</b> <b>cord</b> priming 1 " cartridges) or string loading (a thin layer of bulk emulsion pumped with controlled flow and controlled extraction of the injecting rod). This research focuses on evaluating {{the effects of the}} first two charging methods on the quality of final walls in open-pit and underground operations. Different drilling geometries and charging configurations were applied to both quarrying and tunneling blasts. The Half-Cast Factor (HCF), the Over-break (OB) and the Under-Break (UB) were evaluated as control indicators. Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) were used to classify the rock mass. The research was aimed to push contour blasts to their limits, observing for which geometry and charge configuration the blast lost its design threshold with respect to the final wall for every given rock mass. Results show the operational limits of non-coaxial charges encountered in the rock masses object of this study. In good-quality rock, smooth blasting with decoupled linear charge of 40 g/m can be extended to a spacing S = 22 Øf with little or no detectable drawbacks in terms of final wall quality, in contrast with theoretical formulae for the determination of the radius of damage. On the other hand, when the rock is poor, any quality of the final wall is hardly achieved at all, in spite of any care in the details of execution of smooth blasting. It is concluded that any design criterion and theoretical approach modeling the effects of contour blasting cannot ignore the features of the rock mas...|$|R
