40|$|To {{provide a}} {{positive}} user experience, an application generally needs {{to provide the}} user {{with a sense of}} {{the current state of the}} system. To support disconnected operation, data must be stored locally in caches. These rapidly become stale, leading to a reconciliation problem. Even when connected, getting agreement between distributed nodes on what constitutes current state is far from trivial. Most applications use some sort of database to hold current system state, and from this perspective the problem of agreeing on current state becomes a distributed database problem. Reconciliation involves substantial programming effort and use cases proliferate with the need to program for both connected and <b>disconnected</b> <b>modes</b> of operation. This paper introduces the concept of a FactBase ™ which is a secure and robust distributed collection of Facts. Facts are defined as immutable aggregates of data. This immutability is the key to avoiding reconciliation issues and use case proliferation.
