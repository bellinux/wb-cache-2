5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E

30|$|However, a good grain {{topology}} model {{requires that}} grains fill the entire space {{and do not}} overlap with each other [1 – 3]. Many research groups {{around the world have}} conducted studies aiming at solving this problem. Using the 3 D topology-related grain growth rate equation derived by Macpherson and Srolovitz [2], Wang et al. [3] from the University of Science and Technology Beijing suggested a 3 D <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> model to describe quasi-stationary <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> in 2008. In the same year, Pande and Cooper [4] from the United States Naval Research Laboratory presented a size-based continuum stochastic Fokker–Planck equation describing 2 D <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions,</b> which confirmed the validity of the stochastic approach. In addition, Pande and Cooper [5] found in 2011 that Hillert’s equation, Rayleigh’s equation, and Fokker–Planck’s continuity equation were not suitable for characterizing the upper time limits of the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> obtained during 2 D grain growth in thin films. In 2012, Tucker et al. [6] from the Carnegie Mellon University tried {{to bridge the gap between}} the 2 D and 3 D <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> by using Saltykov’s method. It corrected the upper tail disparity between the 2 D and 3 D <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions,</b> but did not improve its lower tail. In 2015, Beers et al. [7] consolidated various approaches for characterizing grain boundaries in order to develop a multi-scale model of the initial GB structure and energy. In another study conducted by Keshavarz and Ghosh [8] during the same year, a hierarchical crystal model was proposed for simulating polycrystalline microstructures of Ni-based superalloys on the sub-grain, grain, and polycrystalline scales. The above-mentioned studies were indeed capable of solving the overlap problem of grain topological structures; however, they adopted different models for describing the 2 D and 3 D <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> and thus could not be considered universal methods.|$|R

Basegrain is a photogrammetric tool developed to generate grainsize distributions and other information about coarse flood sediments by analyzing adigital photo of the stone bed. The investigation was made by validating the ability forBasegrain to assess <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> of various materials smaller than the blocksused in an erosion protection by comparing sieving results or manual measurementswith the results obtained by the program. A statistical comparison was then made bycomparing the results from sieving and the program.

The results showed that Basegrain generated <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> for coarse gravelthat were {{very close to the}} sieving results.

25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test.|$|E

Because {{the size of the}} particles obviously has a significant effect on the soil behavior, the grain size and <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> are used to classify soils. The <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distribution</b> describes the relative proportions of particles of various sizes. The grain size is often visualized in a cumulative distribution graph which, for example, plots the percentage of particles finer than a given size as a function of size. The median grain size, , is the size for which 50% of the particle mass consists of finer particles. Soil behavior, especially the hydraulic conductivity, tends to be dominated by the smaller particles, hence, the term [...] "effective size", denoted by , is defined as the size for which 10% of the particle mass consists of finer particles.|$|E

40|$|A Cone Penetration Test (CPT) survey {{with a high}} spatial {{resolution}} was performed in order to investigate the stratigraphy {{as well as the}} spatial variability of various soil properties of the Krauthausen test site. Analyses of the CPT measurements showed the subsurface to be dominated by a planar layered structure. Variogram analysis of the various CPT parameters disclosed that within each layer the soil properties have an anisotropic spatial correlation structure. A correlation analysis of the measured CPT data and co-located <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> from soil samples was performed. Since the correlation coefficients were greater equal to 0. 7, a reliable empirical relationship between the data sets could be developed. Based on this empirical relationship <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> were estimated at CPT locations. The statistical processing of estimated and measured <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> with respect to their spatial correlation structure disclosed good agreement between the data sets. The estimated <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> from CPT data were used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer.

The validation of these results, using a prior investigation of hydraulic conductivity statistics, suggests the CPT a fast and inexpensive tool for the estimation of three dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields with sufficient accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} bimodal <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> on the {{mechanical}} properties {{of a newly}} developed TRansformation-TWinning induced plasticity (TRIP/TWIP) steel were investigated. The microstructures with different levels of bimodal <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> were achieved through rolling at 1000, 1100 and 1200 °C where the restoration processes (in particular recrystallization) could be occurred at different rates. The {{results indicated that the}} bimodal distribution parameter was increased by raising the rolling temperature and lowering the thickness reduction. In addition, the room temperature strength and ductility were higher for the materials rolled at higher temperatures, where the level of bimodal <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> (bimodality) was greater. This was justified considering the higher possibility of strain induced transformation and twinning in coarser grains than that of finer ones; this in fact would dictate the material work hardening potential during subsequent tensile deformation. For the material rolled at 1000 °C, where the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>distributions</b> were more homogeneous and the level of bimodal distributions was low, the austenite to martensite transformation during tensile deformation at room temperature was the prevailing mechanism to induce the plasticity. In contrast, in the materials rolled at 1100 and 1200 °C the mechanical twinning came into action thereby a rapid hardening region was recognized in their work hardening behavior. These effects were correlated to the length of work hardening region (dictated by twinning), and the magnitude of hardening rate (controlled by transformation of austenite to a' martensite).
