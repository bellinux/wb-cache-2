5|$|Sousa {{began his}} career playing violin and {{studying}} music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868. After departing the band in 1875, Sousa learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and the writing of music. He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director. On leaving the Marine Band, Sousa organized his own band. Sousa aided {{in the development of}} the sousaphone, a large brass instrument similar to the <b>helicon</b> and tuba. At the outbreak of World War I, Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant commander and led the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. Following his tenure, he returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. In the 1920s he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but never saw active service again.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{microscopic}} {{evaluation of the}} local current density, a treatment of edge magnetoplasmons (EMP) is presented for confining potentials that allow Landau level (LL) flattening to be neglected. Mode damping due to electron-phonon interaction is evaluated. For nu= 1, 2 there exist independent modes spatially symmetric or antisymmetric {{with respect to the}} edge. Certain modes, changing shape during propagation, are nearly undamped even for very strong dissipation and are termed edge <b>helicons.</b> For nu > 2 inter-LL Coulomb coupling leads to a strong repulsion of the decoupled LL fundamental modes. The theory agrees well with recent experiments. Comment: 4 pages in Latex/Revtex/two-column format, 3 ps figure...|$|R

25|$|Unlike his father, Hesiod was {{averse to}} sea travel, but he once crossed the narrow strait between the Greek {{mainland}} and Euboea {{to participate in}} funeral celebrations for one Athamas of Chalcis, and there won a tripod in a singing competition. He also describes a meeting {{between himself and the}} Muses on Mount <b>Helicon,</b> where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a laurel staff, a symbol of poetic authority (Theogony 22–35). Fanciful though the story might seem, the account has led ancient and modern scholars to infer that he was not a professionally trained rhapsode, or he would have been presented with a lyre instead.|$|E

The Idan Raichel Project has released 4 albums as well as a collection of live recordings in Israel on the <b>Helicon</b> Label. Cumbancha, a US based record label, released the group's first album worldwide in 2006.

25|$|First of all, he is {{the author}} of the {{standard}} manuals of Textual Criticism (1978), Greek Metre (1982) and Greek Music (1992). In case 'manual' suggests a second-hand compilation, it should be explicitly stated that all three books represent a deeply original viewpoint. Secondly, in the editing and explication of Greek poetic texts, West has contributed exemplary editions of the fragments of Hesiod (with R. Merkelbach, 1967); of the Greek Iambic and Elegiac poets (1971-2; 2 1989, 1992); of the Anacreontea (1984; 2 1993); of Aeschylus (1990); and of the Iliad (vol. I, 1998). His contribution to Iambus and Elegy was reinforced by invaluable adversaria in Studies in Greek Elegy and Iambus (1974), and his papers on Greek lyric poetry would in themselves make a substantial volume. He celebrated the millennium with a new text of the fundamental poem of Western civilisation, Homer's Iliad. In addition, there are critical texts, with magisterial commentaries, of Hesiod's Theogony (1966) and Works and Days (1978), and The Orphic Poems (1983) and The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women (1985), which reconstruct with great acumen and ingenuity two literary genres familiar to the Greeks but lost to us except in fragments. Thirdly, his interest in the Greeks and the Orient, first exemplified in Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient (1971), recently re-emerged in The East Face of <b>Helicon</b> (1997), a comprehensive and timely investigation of parallels between Greek literature and the literatures of the Ancient Near East based on first-hand acquaintance with the texts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} and lower ranges of the fanfare {{orchestra}} are French horns. Tenor horns can also be used, but this is rare. Lower than the French horns are baritone horns and euphoniums, trombones, occasionally a bass trombone, and B flat and E flat tubas (and optionally, sousaphones and /or <b>helicons).</b> The lower instrumentation of a fanfare band is virtually identical {{to that of a}} brass band, {{aside from the fact that}} there are baritone saxophones in the fanfare band, while several bands sport alto saxophones, soprano saxophones and tenor saxophones as well (few bands even have a rare use of the bass saxophone). There is often an abundance of percussion players (from 4-6), using snare drums, bass drums, cymbals and glockenspiels. German fanfare orchestras would also sport wagner tubas in the bass section.|$|R
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{treatment of}} edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs) is presented {{for the case}} of not-too-low temperatures in which the inequality k_BT≫ħ v_g/ℓ_ 0, where v_g is the group velocity of the edge states and ℓ_ 0 is the magnetic length, is fulfilled, and for filling factors ν = 1 (2). We have obtained independent EMP modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric {{with respect to the}} edge. We describe in detail the spatial structure and dispersion relations of the new edge waves (edge <b>helicons,</b> dipole, quadrupole and octupole EMPs), which have the characteristic length ℓ_T=ℓ_ 0 ^ 2 k_BT/ħ v_g. We have found that, in contrast to well-known results for a spatially homogeneous dissipation within the channel, the damping of the fundamental EMP at not-too-low temperatures is not quantized and has a T^- 1 dependence.

There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes; Demosthenes alludes to a [...] "winter battle" [...] and [...] "battle on the river" [...] in his speeches, but no other details are preserved. Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the main allied army defending the road at Chaeronea.|$|E
500|$|Several years {{long after}} serving his apprenticeship, Sousa joined a {{theatrical}} (pit) orchestra {{where he learned}} to conduct. He returned to the U.S. Marine Band as its head in 1880 and remained as its conductor until 1892. Sousa led [...] "The President's Own" [...] band under five presidents from Rutherford B. Hayes to Benjamin Harrison. Sousa's band played at two Inaugural Balls, those of James A. Garfield in 1881, and Benjamin Harrison in 1889. The marching brass bass, or sousaphone, a modified <b>helicon,</b> was created by J. W. Pepper– a Philadelphia instrument maker who created the instrument in 1893 at Sousa's request using several of his suggestions in its design. He wanted a tuba that could sound upward and over the band whether its player was seated or marching. The sousaphone was re-created in 1898 by C.G. Conn {{and this was the}} model that Sousa preferred to use.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe minimal {{sufficient}} set of plasma parameters {{is presented}} to describe the dispersion properties of electron whistler waves (<b>helicons)</b> in a wide frequency range above the ion cutoff frequency, provided that the wave frequency is {{significantly lower than the}} electron plasma frequency. When the gyrofrequency of the lightest ions is much higher than those of heavier ions, it is sufficient to know the relative content of the lightest ions, the highest ion cutoff frequency, the lower hybrid resonance frequency, and the electron gyro- and plasma frequencies. In this case, the frequency of electron whistler waves is determined by the upper root of the biquadratic equation derived, whereas the lower root corresponds to a resonant mode with its refractive index increasing when the frequency tends toward the highest ion gyrofrequency from below. The developed approach is also efficient in plasmas containing a substantial amount of negative ions and/or heavy dust particulates. The accuracy of the approximate solution of the total cold plasma dispersion relation is illustrated graphically...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{evaluated}} {{the development of}} embryogenic callus from transversal ovary sections. The experiments were carried out under two experimental regimes using combinations of IAA (0; 5. 71; 8. 56; 11. 42; 14. 27 &# 956;M) and 2, 4 -D (0; 13. 57; 18. 10; 22. 62 &# 956;M) or combinations of 2, 4 -D with BA (0; 4. 43; 6. 65; 8. 87; 11. 09 &# 956;M). Assessments were made of anatomical aspects of the callus and {{for the presence of}} embryogenic structures using cytochemical and histological analyses and stereomicroscopic and scanning electronic microscopic observations. Treatments with 2, 4 -D and IAA produced friable calluses demonstrating cellular acquisition of morphogenetic competence as well as the formation of pro-embryogenic sectors. The expression of embryogenic program could be observed, with proembryogenic cell clusters developing into globular embryos. These results offer the possibility of using new types of explants for culturing <b>helicons</b> that avoid the growth of endophytic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|A quasi-microscopic {{treatment}} of edge magnetoplasmons (EMP) is presented for very low temperatures and confining potentials smooth {{on the scale}} of the magnetic length ℓ_ 0 but sufficiently steep at the edges such that Landau level (LL) flattening can be discarded. The profile of the unperturbed electron density is sharp and the dissipation taken into account comes only from electron intra-edge and intra-LL transitions due to scattering by acoustic phonons. For wide channels and filling factors ν = 1 and 2, there exist independent EMP modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the edge. Some of these modes, named edge <b>helicons,</b> can propagate nearly undamped even when the dissipation is strong. Their density profile changes qualitatively during propagation and is given by a rotation of a complex vector function. For ν > 2, the Coulomb coupling between the LLs leads to a repulsion of the uncoupled fundamental LL modes: the new modes have very different group velocities and are nearly undamped. The theory accounts well for the experimentally observed plateau structure of the delay times {{as well as for the}} EMP's period and decay rates. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
