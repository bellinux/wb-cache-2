30|$|Rooth (1985, 1992) {{propose the}} theory of {{alternative}} semantics to explain this phenomenon. In addition to ordinary semantic values (i.e., the denotation of phrases or sentences), there is another type of semantic value, namely, focus semantic values. To state it more clearly, the focus semantic value refers to the set of elements “obtainable from the ordinary semantic value by making a substitution in the position corresponding to the focused phrase” (Rooth 1992 : 76). The elements that can be the replacement {{are determined by the}} context. For example, in 26 a, the focus associate is Bill, and the ordinary semantic value of the syntactic sister of only (i.e., [VP introduced [BILL]F to Sue]) is the property of introducing Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue.</b> <b>To</b> obtain the focus semantic value, the focus associate Bill is replaced by other individuals salient in the context, like Matt, Tom, or Bill himself, resulting in the set of properties {introduce Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> introduce Matt <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> introduce Tom <b>to</b> Sue}. This set is the focus semantic value of the sister of only. Then, the focus particles only asserts that all properties in the set are excluded (i.e., introducing Matt <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> introducing Tom <b>to</b> <b>Sue)</b> except the property that has the same meaning as the ordinary semantic value (i.e., introducing Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue).</b> Thus, 26 a has the meaning that John introduced Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue</b> and he did not introduce other people <b>to</b> <b>Sue.</b>|$|R
30|$|For ease of exposition, I {{call the}} sister of focus {{particles}} “the focus domain” (e.g., [VP(=FD) introduced [BILL]F to Sue] in 26 a) 15. The ordinary semantic value and focus semantic value of the focus domain are called “the focused denotation” and “the alternatives,” respectively. Besides, I assume that the alternatives include only members with different meanings from the focused denotation (e.g., {introduce Matt <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> introduce Tom <b>to</b> Sue} for the alternatives of 26 a). Based on this, the focus particle only asserts that the focused denotation (i.e., introducing Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue),</b> but not alternatives (i.e., introducing Matt <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> introducing Tom <b>to</b> <b>Sue),</b> participates in the following semantic computation. This results in the meaning that the subject John possesses the focused denotation, namely introducing Bill <b>to</b> <b>Sue,</b> but not the alternatives.|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{surveys the}} {{contemporary}} status of copyright law regarding a creator-assignee 2 ̆ 7 s standing <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for infringement and the bases for allowing a creator-assignee {{to bring an}} infringement action. Part II begins the discussion with {{a review of the}} general principles of copyright law, including its constitutional and statutory frameworks, its underlying policies, and the moral rights doctrine. Part III continues with an overview of the general constitutional standing principles and real party in interest prerequisites. It then outlines the statutory and judicial limits on standing <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> under copyright law. Part IV discusses the issue of assignee standing in copyright law and then reviews the issue of creator-assignee 2 ̆ 7 s standing <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b> This discussion focuses on the recent case of Silvers v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc., in which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a creator-assignee does not have standing <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b> Finally, Part V sets forth three arguments for granting a creator-assignee standing <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for copyright infringement. First, granting a creator-assignee standing <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> effectuates Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intent that the rights granted under the Copyright Act of 1976 be divisible and alienable. Second, a creator-assignee fulfills the standing and real party in interest prerequisites. Finally, allowing a creator-assignee standing <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> advances the constitutional goals of promoting progress and protecting a creator 2 ̆ 7 s rights in her work. The thrust of this argument relies on both the economic and non-economic justifications of copyright law, in particular the right of attribution...|$|R
