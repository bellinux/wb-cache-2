25|$|In modern times, the {{majority}} of <b>food</b> <b>cans</b> in the UK have been lined with a plastic coating containing bisphenol A (BPA). The coating prevents acids and other substances from corroding the tin or aluminium of the can but leaching of BPA into the can's contents is currently (as of 2013) being investigated as a potential health hazard.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} pull tabs in {{beverage}} cans {{spread to the}} canning of various food products, such as pet food or nuts (and non-food products such as motor oil and tennis balls). The ends are known as easy open lids because they open without any tools or implements. An additional innovation developed for specifically for <b>food</b> <b>cans</b> uses a tab that is bent slightly upwards, creating a larger surface area for easier finger access.|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 {{experiment}} {{by researchers}} at the Harvard School of Public Health indicated that BPA used in the lining of <b>food</b> <b>cans</b> is absorbed by the food and then ingested by consumers. Of 75 participants, half ate a lunch of canned vegetable soup for five days, followed by five days of fresh soup, while the other half did the same experiment in reverse order. [...] "The analysis revealed that when participants ate the canned soup, they experienced more than a 1,000 percent increase in their urinary concentrations of BPA, compared to when they dined on fresh soup." ...|$|E

50|$|Boiling {{can be done}} {{in several}} ways: The <b>food</b> <b>can</b> be placed into already rapidly boiling water and left to cook, the heat can be turned down and the <b>food</b> <b>can</b> be simmered; or the <b>food</b> <b>can</b> also be placed into the pot, and cold water may be added to the pot.

2500|$|Sergeant Buckland {{had given}} {{evidence}} on 3 March {{that he had}} investigated Dala and his evidence was so disparaging to Gribble's claims for the site that Commissioner Wood visited Dala on the 14th to see for himself. From what he found, Wood had no hesitation in declaring Buckland unreliable and less than candid with the commission and confirmed Gribble's account. The rainy season was late and the ash and footprints were still present and clearly visible (the first rain of the season fell {{the day after the}} Commission left). Sergeant Buckland had claimed that when he visited the site he found no evidence of a police camp, Wood found the site strewn with empty <b>food</b> <b>cans</b> and tobacco tins which he regarded as evidence of a police camp. A partially burnt tree surrounded by ash was peppered with what Gribble claimed were bullet scars but which Buckland had testified were marks made by stones or other blunt objects. Recalled by Wood, Buckland admitted that one of the marks had been a bullet scar and that Quartpot, a police tracker, had later dug a bullet from it which Wood asked to be produced. Constable Donegan, who had taken possession of the bullet, had said that he was not certain if he could find it, however it was found and given to Wood. Later, Inspector Douglas said that the bullet looked like a [...]44, the same caliber as the police issue Winchester although lighter in weight, but stated that it would be impossible for a bullet to pass through a human body and lodge in a tree behind it. Green noted that the Winchester rifle was a popular model carried by travelers in the area and that bullets extracted from trees in the Kimberley did not necessarily come from police rifles. At the subsequent trial of Regan and St Jack, Buckland repeated his testimony that there was no police camp at Dala, the tree scars had been made by a stone and the recovery of the bullet was never brought up.|$|E
