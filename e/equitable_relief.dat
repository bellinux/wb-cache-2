25|$|Judge Pine {{began the}} hearing on schedule.

Additionally, the Federal Tort Claims Act required the government to give its consent to be sued for relief, and this the government had not done.

Most of the company attorneys seemed shocked by Pine's request, and were unable to address the issue. But Charles Tuttle, counsel for Armco Steel, squarely argued the issue. In his counter-argument the following day, Baldridge claimed that the courts had no authority to enjoin the President of the United States and then argued that the court should ignore the constitutional issue if it could decide the case on grounds of equity.

500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of its legal work, the ACLU is often {{involved}} in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments; a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the developing {{law in the}} US applicable to judicial decisions to grant or to deny various forms of <b>equitable</b> injunctive <b>relief</b> {{as a tool for}} intellectual property rights enforcement. It then analyzes the 2006 US Supreme Court decision, eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 US 388 (2006), which reversed a prevailing general rule in US jurisprudence that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances, and held that the existence of an IP infringement itself did not necessarily entitle the right-holder to an injunction. The author places the eBay decision’s restoration of flexibility and discretion to trial court judges in regard to injunctive relief in an international context by showing that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is likewise flexible, and pointing to the possible lessons in terms of policy choices that post-eBay jurisprudence in the US may offer the law-makers and the judiciary in developing countries in balancing the right-holders’ interest and public interest when deciding to grant an injunction. These policy choices include the amount of compensation considered to be fair and adequate for different types of intellectual property right-holders; the costs of judicial supervision of injunctive remedies and concerns that such remedies may excessively empower right holders; the potential for injunctive remedies to deter legitimate challenges to the validity of asserted rights; and the public interests that warrant authorizing prospective infringement.

40|$|The <b>equitable</b> {{principle}} of <b>relief</b> from penalties and forfeitures {{is so far}} elementary as almost to defy analysis. Many, perhaps most, of the judicial explanations of the principle have based it upon interpretation or construction, appealing to the doctrine that equity regards intent rather than form. Yet a logical application of this doctrine would lead to results very different from those which have actually been arrived at in the decisions. Thus, a stipulation in a mortgage that the mortgagor waives his equity of redemption can hardly be interpreted as meaning {{that he does not}} waive it, yet all such stipulations are ignored and redemption granted, nevertheless. Again, a penalty for breach of contract cannot be saved by the most solemn declaration that it is intended as liquidated damages. It must be conceded that many cases have actually been, decided on the interpretation theory, producing such enormities as Iowa Land Co. v. Mickel, 41 Ia. 402 (sale of land, $ 150 out of $ 600 paid, $ 4000 in improvements, second instalment of $ 150 one day late due to a misunderstanding; held forfeited), and Doctornan v.

40|$|The Civil Rights Act of 1991, which {{provides}} compensatory and punitive damages and attendant jury trials in cases alleging intentional discrimination, {{was designed to}} enhance enforcement and expand remedies. Its enactment, however, has triggered a schism among the circuit courts over what the proper standard is for determining whether monetary damages or injunctive relief predominates, a necessary inquiry for determining whether plaintiffs are entitled to class certification for Title VII claims under Rule 23 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Led by the Fifth Circuit, some federal appeals courts contend that monetary relief predominates unless it is “incidental,” and that compensatory and punitive damages are by “nature” not incidental. On {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum is the Second Circuit’s standard - adopted by the Ninth - which permits the courts to use a flexible “ad hoc” approach when determining predomination. This article contends that should the Supreme Court accept the narrow incidental interpretation of the predomination requirement, employees fighting systemic intentional discrimination will be denied one of the most powerful weapons in their arsenal for justice - the class action. For decades, Title VII class actions have resulted in extensive reforms in employers’ policies and millions of dollars in <b>equitable</b> monetary <b>relief</b> for thousands of employees nationwide. However, this traditional means of enforcement has come under attack. Specifically, the restrictive incidental interpretation diminishes the number of class actions, deprives employees of full relief, and imposes greater costs and burdens on those employment discrimination class actions that do survive. Deterrence and fairness are also undermined. The ad hoc approach, on the other hand, respects the courts’ discretion and properly reconciles the goals of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and Rule 23. The ad hoc approach’s flexibility allows plaintiffs to seek full relief, while enjoying due process protections available through hybrid certification and discretionary notice and opt-out rights. Furthermore, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and recent amendments to Rule 23 curb potential judicial abuse, and confirm the propriety of allowing federal courts wide latitude in making class certification determinations. Consequently, when the Supreme Court has the occasion to consider the propriety of the Rule 23 (b) (2) predomination test, it should embrace the ad hoc balancing test to preserve this essential civil rights enforcement tool - the class action.

40|$|In this Special Section of the journal, {{we present}} some {{articles}} {{from a recent}} study that has attempted to piece together a detailed history {{of the field of}} cancer pain relief since 1945. Our interdisciplinary team of authors has expertise from the social sciences, from ethics and history, and from medicine and nursing. Our focus has been on identifying key forms of technological innovation, such as new pharmaceutical inventions and discoveries, as well as the redeployment into pain management of existing technologies used in other areas of health care. We have looked at how changing approaches to cancer pain relief are tied up with shifting understandings of patients and the problems they encounter with their disease, and how these are expressed in narratives of pain. At the same time, we have examined public health perspectives, seeing policy and strategic planning as ‘technologies’ that may impact upon cancer patients suffering pain. We have undertaken wide-ranging literature reviews, studied the detailed post–World War II history of the field of cancer pain relief, conducted interviews with key leaders in the field {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and traced patterns of innovation in new drugs, their modes of delivery, and the forces that shape clinical change. We have shown how, over the past fifty years, cancer patients have become more actively involved in their treatment and care; how concepts of cancer pain have moved beyond the physical to encompass mental, spiritual, and social suffering; and how the understanding of pain mechanisms and measurement has deepened. In this context, the promotion of patient autonomy has been a key driver of change—leading to the introduction of long-acting, pain-relieving drugs, special technologies for their delivery, and the vision of individually tailored pain management strategies. Such benefits have come within the compass of many—though not all—cancer patients in affluent nations. Elsewhere, in the poorer regions of the world, great problems persist. Draconian laws inhibit the manufacture, transportation, and medical use of strong opioids, clinicians remain anxious about their use, and patients fear the stigma associated with such treatments. From time to time, such concerns resurface in countries with otherwise well-developed approaches to pain and palliative care. The world of cancer pain is, therefore, fractured by significant moral and practical dilemmas that continue to demand attention. We hope that by setting out some aspects of historical development, our study can contribute to several key debates about freedom from pain as a basic human right, the ethical challenges that surround it, and the scientific, clinical, and political strategies that should prevail in the further development of innovative technologies for comprehensive and <b>equitable</b> cancer pain <b>relief</b> for all...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{spends more}} than $ 19 billion each year on border and {{immigration}} enforcement. [1] The Obama administration removed more people in eight years than the last four administrations combined. [2] Yet, to the Trump administration, enforcement is not yet robust enough. Among other measures, the administration favors more expedited and summary removals. More than 80 percent[3] of all removal orders are already issued outside the court process: When the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses summary removal processes, both access to counsel and an immigration judge can be nearly impossible. Advocates and policy analysts are equally concerned that a backlog of over 545, 000 immigration court cases creates delay that harm people seeking asylum and other humanitarian protection. Recent use of priority or “rocket” dockets in immigration court and lack of appointed counsel also interfere with the fair adjudication of claims. Thus the administrative removal system is criticized both for being inefficient and moving too slowly, on the one hand, and for moving too quickly without adequate procedural safeguards, on the other. Both critiques have merit. The challenge is to design, implement, and most critically, maintain an appropriately balanced adjudication system. While {{it is clear that}} US removal procedures need reform, process alone {{will not be able to}} address some of the systematic flaws within the system. Ultimately, the DHS will need to refine and prioritize the cases that are placed into the system and the government needs new tools, widely used in other adjudication systems, that can reduce backlogs, incentivize cooperation, and facilitate resolution. Congress should similarly reexamine the barriers to status and avenues for regularization or preservation of status. The paucity of <b>equitable</b> forms or <b>relief</b> and the lack of statutes of limitation place stress on the immigration court system. The lack of appointed counsel has a dramatic impact on case outcomes. Without counsel, the rule of law is barely a constraint on government authority. Conversely, a system of appointed counsel could lead to efficiencies and to a culture of negotiation and settlement within the immigration court system. DHS has increasingly used every tool in its arsenal to expeditiously remove people from the United States and most of these tools bypass judicial hearings. In these “ministerial” or expedited forms of removal, there is no courtroom, there is no administrative judge, and there are rarely any opportunities for legal counsel to participate. Moreover, there is rarely an opportunity for federal judicial review. In these settings, the rule of law is entirely within the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers who serve as both prosecutor and judge. There is little record keeping and almost no avenue for administrative or judicial review. This paper will argue that the rule of law is missing in the US removal adjudication system, and will propose ways in which it can be restored. [1] In fiscal year (FY) 2016, the budget for CBP and ICE was $ 19. 3 billion. See analysis by the American Immigration Council (2017 a) about the costs of immigration enforcement. The budget for the immigration court has grown only 30 percent in comparison with a 70 percent increase in the budget of the DHS enforcement. [2] Taken from Obama removal data and comparison to past administrations (Arthur 2017). [3] The DHS does not routinely publish full statistical data that allows a comparison of the forms of removal. In a recent report by the Congressional Research Service, the analyst concluded that 44 percent were expedited removals as described below, and an additional 39 percent were reinstatement of removals — 83 percent of all orders of removal were outside the full immigration court system (Congressional Research Service 2015) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyse tax reform {{measures}} to secure the tax revenue base, in particular the personal income tax structure of South Africa. The main objectives are: firstly, to identify personal income tax reform interventions so as to align the personal income tax structure in South Africa with international best practices. Secondly, the impact of tax reforms on revenue collection, given optimal economic growth levels, is determined. Thirdly, to determine the best tax reform scenario which could minimise the individual tax burden and maximise its efficiency. Lastly, the impact of the suggested tax reforms on fairness as a principle of a good tax system is evaluated. A static micro-simulation model is developed from survey data and used to simulate the proposed tax reforms. Different tax reforms were selected from a study of international tax reform trends and an analysis of the South African personal income tax structure. The literature provides clear margins for the structuring of tax bands and threshold margins. Tax elasticities are estimated in order to explain the methodology for determining the impact of tax reforms. These elasticities include the elasticities for determining the progressiveness of the PIT structure, determining the deadweight loss (tax efficiency) and also to determine the optimal levels of taxes and economic growth and revenue maximisation. The different tax reform scenarios take the economy closer to or further away from optimum growth and optimum revenue. The results show that as far as marginal rates are concerned, a lowering in rates to levels on par with South Africa’s peers offers potential for improved levels of efficiency with the tax burden equal to or even below the optimal tax ratio from an economic growth point of view. Although such a ratio is below the optimal revenue ratio the results suggest that the loss in revenue could be minimised over time through a resultant increase in productivity and economic growth. By adjusting the non-taxable thresholds and taxable income bands according to the algorithm defined in the best practice scenario, more taxpayers will be included into the tax net but with a net decrease in tax liability. As a result the tax/GDP level also declines to a level below the optimal growth level but tax efficiency increases. The resultant loss in revenue will have to be recouped through increases in other than individual income taxes but improved levels of tax morality because of the lower margins for each tax band and increased productivity might also contribute to increased revenue performance. The tax structure is also more progressive which contributes towards the “fairness” of the tax regime. Regarding tax expenditure reforms, the analysis shows that medical tax credits offer a more <b>equitable</b> form of <b>relief</b> than medical deductions which substantiate this kind of reform as already implemented by government and which is to be fully phased in {{over the next couple of}} years. Tax liability is slightly lower in the case of medical credits compared to medical deductions but the difference is only marginal as far as net revenue and optimal growth and efficiency is concerned. However, a medical credit which increases disposable income at the lower end of the scale and discriminates against higher income groups also improves progressiveness of the tax regime and therefore the fairness thereof accordingly. Finally, the demographic impact of the suggested reforms also shows some important trends. Better education improves skills levels which seems to be positively correlated to taxable income levels. As far as age is concerned, the analysis shows that a substantial number of taxpayers in the categories below the age of 24 and above 65 fall within the lower taxable income groups. Those are also the most vulnerable groups from a subsistence point of view. Thus, tax reform that specifically improves their levels of disposable income should be prioritised in order to address equity and fairness as objectives for a “good” tax structure.

2500|$|In modern practice, {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> unless there is [...] "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question.

[...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. [...] An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach. [...] The lawsuit sought injunctive and other <b>equitable</b> <b>relief,</b> as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class.|$|E
