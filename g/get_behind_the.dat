5|$|Following {{the fall}} of the town, as the {{remainder}} of the 5th Division was rested, the 15th Battalion, which had seen less action due to being held in reserve, was committed to pursuing the withdrawing Japanese. The battalion advanced north towards the Markham River, and on 14 September two companies were transported by barge in an effort to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> fugitives and cut them off, but they arrived about an hour too late. On 17 September, the battalion established a large ambush site along the coast south of the river to prevent the fleeing Japanese from evacuating by the sea. The following day, the ambush was sprung as a platoon-sized group attempted to get away. After being beaten back into the jungle, they launched an attack on one of the Australian positions that was blocking their escape. In the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting, 13 Japanese were killed and one prisoner taken. Further minor clashes followed as the 15th patrolled north and, by late October, it entered Lae. The battalion subsequently took up defensive duties around the town as the 29th Brigade was assigned the task of holding Lae to free up troops from the 7th Division for operations in the Finisterre Range further to the west.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} {{by taking a}} single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over.

The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E

A break in the retina can occur from a posterior vitreous detachment, injury to the eye, or inflammation of the eye. Other risk factors include being short sighted and previous cataract surgery. Retinal detachments also rarely occur due to a choroidal tumor. Diagnosis is by either looking {{at the back of the}} eye with an ophthalmoscope or by ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|He {{improved}} the training regime, introducing ballwork to training sessions, a practice rare in England at the time; the youth and scouting systems begun by his predecessor were extended and he abandoned the club's old recruiting policy of signing often unreliable stars, opting instead for lesser known but more reliable {{players from the}} lower divisions. He also urged the club's fans to be more partisan and to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> team. Drake's early years were unpromising, as Chelsea finished 19th and just a point away from relegation {{in his first season}} and 8th in his second.|$|E

The Young Guards tried to fight their way through Pillar's men but were soon forced to surrender. A body of defenders tried to get away north to Berry-au-Bac but they were intercepted by Russian cavalry and over 200 survivors were captured. Some French defenders retreated to the northwest along the north bank of the Vesle. Though pursued by Allied horsemen, they escaped when Defrance's six squadrons of honor guards and hussars arrived in time to cover their withdrawal. Altogether, 2,500 French infantry and 11 guns fell into Allied hands in the city. A second source stated that 100 men of the 1,356-man garrison were killed and most of the remainder captured, including General Jean-Laurent Lacoste-Duvivier.|$|E
25|$|Three marked Cleveland Police {{vehicles}} {{were the first}} to arrive on the scene at 8:30 PM, one on Beulah Avenue and two at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview Road. Patrolmen Kenneth Gibbons and Willard Wolff {{were the first to}} arrive at the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale, at 8:30 PM. They claim to have observed a plainclothes police officer grappling with a young African American male in or near the front yard of the Evans home. As they exited their vehicle to assist, a rifle bullet struck the engine of their marked police vehicle. It exploded, killing Wolff and severely injuring Gibbons. Police Sergeants Sam Levy and Bill Moran arrived moments behind Gibbons and Wolff. They ran behind the duplexes at 1435 and 1439 Lakeview Road, and used the alley to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Lakeview Tavern. They then moved down the driveway between the tavern and the Evans home to reach Auburndale Avenue. At this point, Moran was shot and dived behind a car parked on the street, where he was shot again.

Besson states that in order to achieve this he stepped away from the factual narrative of the 15th century, instead trying to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> [...] "exterior envelope" [...] and into both the emotional effect and affect of Joan. In the book The Films of Luc Besson, Susan Hayward interprets this as meaning Besson sought to follow Joan emotionally, revealing her doubts and demonstrating that one cannot return intact from the experience of war.|$|E

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I‚Äôm really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing".|$|E

U2's manager Guy Oseary also indicated that the group had future collaborations with Apple planned dealing with [...] "how music is heard and innovation". He said the band wants to support albums as an [...] "art form of artwork and lyrics and video content" [...] that will engage listeners more so than digital audio. In a 29 September 2014 cover story for Time, U2 revealed they are working with Apple to develop a new digital music format they hope will sway consumers' interest in purchasing music again. Bono described it as [...] "an audiovisual interactive format for music that can't be pirated and will bring back album artwork in the most powerful way, where you can play with the lyrics and <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> songs". He said the format was 18 months from completion and that the group hopes it will financially benefit lesser-known music artists.|$|E

500|$|Their Boer opponents taught {{not only}} the cavalry but the whole army some lessons. In one {{engagement}} at Dronfield, 150 Boers held off the British cavalry division, which was then supported by several artillery batteries, and at Bergendal seventy-four men held up the entire British Army. So effective were their tactics that they forced the British cavalry, {{if only for a}} short time, to leave their swords and lances behind and concentrate on their firepower. This proved to the British Army the value of a full size rifle over a carbine. Soon the cavalry were practising working dismounted and advancing in open order. Their change in tactics was evidenced during the charge at Klip Drift. On their way to relieve the siege of Kimberley, the cavalry used their horses and rifles instead of swords and lances to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> defending Boers. The charge was later described as [...] "an ideal cavalry operation, but not a cavalry charge as the term is generally understood." [...] Nevertheless, it would prove to be the last time that a full British cavalry division conducted a mounted charge.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{personally}} {{met with}} senior {{figures of the}} apartheid regime, including Hendrik Verwoerd's widow, Betsie Schoombie, and lawyer Percy Yutar, also laying a wreath by the statue of Afrikaner hero Daniel Theron. Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that [...] "courageous people do not fear forgiving, {{for the sake of}} peace." [...] He encouraged black South Africans to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Mandela wore a Springbok shirt at the final against New Zealand, and after the Springboks won the match, Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as de Klerk later put it, [...] "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans." [...] Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. Among the latter was his estranged wife, Winnie, who accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.|$|E
500|$|A third {{series was}} {{announced}} on 27 September 2010, commissioned by BBC Learning, {{as part of}} a new BBC strategy to provide learning opportunities for all audiences. Saul Nass√©, Controller of Learning, said, [...] "I want to use BBC programmes that are known and loved by audiences that can serve as springboards for learning. [...] We'll be enlisting the help of the BBC's best talent to maximise the reach of our output," [...] and Sathe commented, [...] "We are thrilled with the success of the first two series and have already started to storyline the third. Be prepared for a few familiar faces, a couple of new ones and a lot of fireworks." [...] It was confirmed that Learning would fund the third series and work with young people to develop storylines [...] "that bring to life subjects in the Personal, Social, Health Education (PSHE) curriculum such as bullying or peer pressure." [...] A regional schools tour was organised to tie in with the launch of the series, with pupils writing short scenes based on scenarios tying in with the PSHE curriculum, which were performed, filmed and edited. Sarah Miller, BBC Learning commissioner and executive producer of series 3, explained: [...] "The schools tour was a terrific opportunity to deliver powerful face-to-face workshops, giving students and teachers the opportunity to develop key media production skills and to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes of a top BBC drama." ...|$|E

500|$|Morris {{was seen}} as an elegant and {{aggressive}} player, and is regarded alongside Clem Hill, Neil Harvey and Allan Border as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. Adept at playing against both pace and spin bowling, he was known for the variety of his shots {{on both sides of the}} wicket. Despite standing only fivefeetnineinches(1.75m), opponents spoke of his imposing appearance and his apparent air of complete composure at the crease. He had the ability to decide on his stroke early in the ball's flight and employed an unusual defensive technique, shuffling across the stumps to <b>get</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> ball. This created a perception that he was vulnerable to leg before wicket decisions and was vulnerable to losing his leg stump. Deft placement allowed him to pierce the gaps between fielders, and he was especially noted for his cover driving, square cutting and on-driving. Most of all, he was known for his back foot play, especially his pulling and hooking. According to cricket writer Ray Robinson, [...] "no other post-war batsman has rivalled his smashing counter-attacks on bowling swift enough to give the toughest team the tremors‚Ä¶A menacing bouncer colliding with Morris' bat was like a rocky fist against an iron jaw." [...] While many batsmen tended to evade deliveries aimed at the head, Morris was known for standing and hooking. In one interstate match, Miller, one of the world's leading pacemen, bowled an entire eight-ball over of bouncers. Morris hooked the five balls that he faced in the over for 4, 4, 4, 4 and 3.|$|E
