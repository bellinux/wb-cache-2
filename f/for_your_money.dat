25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

2500|$|Luke Winkie of MusicOMH {{gave the}} album a mixed review. He {{said that the}} group's [...] "charm doesn't {{translate}} well over {{the weight of a}} full album's listen" [...] and criticized the lack of strong material saying that [...] "there isn't enough to these songs to merit more than a cursory scan" [...] and that the group [...] "hit the same safe notes, and stick to the same safe themes for all 30 minutes of the album." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music criticized the band for mixing [...] "cast-off recordings with previously released album tracks and present it as a new mini-album" [...] and felt that the Saturdays are [...] "in some kind of decline". He said [...] "what you get <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>money</b> are two potential future hits, four songs you probably already own, one slightly mad album track – Puppet – and a solid-gold clunker" [...] and noticed that it is not [...] "a mini-album, it's a double A-side, or an EP at best." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express said that although the album is [...] "not exactly bad", it sounds [...] "much like everything else out there" [...] and [...] "in the parlance of the kids it’s aimed at, a bit “whatever”". [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music complimented the songs [...] "Higher" [...] and [...] "Puppet", but said that [...] "if the intention is to whip up a storm of excitement, [...] then it's a case of mission unaccomplished". Hazel Sheffield of NME called the album [...] "a summer hatchet-job" [...] and although she praised the single [...] "Missing You", she felt that [...] "the rest is filler in Rihanna's slipstream" [...] and awarded the album five out of ten.|$|E
