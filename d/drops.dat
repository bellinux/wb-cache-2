50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full cone nozzles {{have the largest}} <b>drop</b> size, {{followed}} by flat spray nozzles. Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest <b>drop</b> size. Spraying pressure: <b>Drop</b> size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on <b>drop</b> size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure <b>drop</b> and decrease the <b>drop</b> size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure <b>drop</b> and increase the <b>drop</b> size.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of an oil <b>drop</b> from a single capillary in a continuous phase flowing perpendicular to the capillary opening has been studied numerically. The shear stress at the interface of the forming <b>drop,</b> the angular velocity inside the <b>drop</b> and the pressure field around the <b>drop</b> have been determined in {{a cross section of}} the <b>drop</b> formation area. The results show a maximum pressure in the continuous phase near the stagnation point and a maximum shear stress in both phases nearer the top of the forming <b>drop.</b> The lowest pressures were found behind the top of the <b>drop,</b> where the surrounding flow starts to separate from the interface of the <b>drop.</b> The shear stress outside the <b>drop</b> causes a drag which, together with the drag originated from the pressure field around the <b>drop,</b> promotes <b>drop</b> detachment...|$|R

40|$|The {{detailed}} aerodynamic {{structure of}} air-assisted swirl atomizer sprays is investigated in this paper. In contrast to previously published papers on spray characterization, special {{emphasis is placed}} on the region near the atomizer exit where significant variation of the mean <b>drop</b> size and <b>drop</b> velocity occurs. Simple correlations are found for the spray mean <b>drop</b> size and some initial input parameters. Measurements of <b>drop</b> acceleration and deceleration can be well related to the line-of-sight variations in mean <b>drop</b> size and number density. It is found that the initial <b>drop</b> acceleration and spray dispersion cause the initial decrease of axial mean <b>drop</b> diameters and subsequent <b>drop</b> deceleration causes the increase of mean <b>drop</b> diameters...|$|R

40|$|Key words: dynamic {{pressure}} <b>drop,</b> reciprocating compressor performance analysis, acoustical studies, frequency-domain and time-domain solvers Executive Summary Static and {{dynamic pressure}} <b>drop</b> are {{important factors in}} calculating reciprocating compressor system performance. Calculation of static pressure <b>drop</b> has been well understood for many years. Calculation of dynamic pressure <b>drop</b> resulting from flow fluctuations requires specialized pressure pulsation analysis. Dynamic pressure <b>drop</b> can be as large, or larger, than static pressure <b>drop</b> in some cases, so accurate calculation of the dynamic pressure <b>drop</b> is critical. Technical gaps in some pressure pulsation simulation programs do not allow for calculation of dynamic pressure <b>drop.</b> Also, industry practice for compressor performance modeling is to make generic assumptions about pressure <b>drop</b> through the piping system. These factors can lead to large errors in the calculated compressor performance. New simulation tools {{have been developed to}} address this technical gap in calculating dynamic pressure <b>drop</b> as well as including the true total pressure <b>drop</b> in compressor performance calculations. Accurate calculation of dynamic pressure <b>drop</b> means the compressor performance can be verified in the design stage, thus avoidin...|$|R

The effects of base diameter of the cone, cone angle, interfacial tension, and the densities of the <b>drop</b> and the surrounding fluid on the maximum and detached <b>drop</b> volumes are predicted...|$|R
