5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|After getting Ron released, {{the parks}} {{department}} holds an intervention for him about Tammy, even playing a previously recorded tape of Ron warning himself {{to stay away}} from her. Ron ignores the warnings and prepares to take Tammy to his cabin for a sex-filled honeymoon after her bridal shower. Leslie blames Tom for the dilemma and, although he initially claims to be unfazed, Tom later arrives at the bridal shower to stop Ron from going on the honeymoon. He reveals the whole marriage is a ploy by Tammy to once again make him miserable. Tammy attacks and mercilessly beats Tom, prompting Ron to remember what a monster she truly is and dump her. <b>He</b> <b>literally</b> carries Tom away, and the two later make amends. Despite the bad impression he made the day before, Ben asks Trumple for the Harvest Festival favor. The chief unconditionally agrees out of respect for Leslie, who he said always helps everyone, and because Leslie once dated his friend Dave (Louis C.K.). Ben seems relieved Leslie and Dave are no longer together, and he later asks Leslie out to eat.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. <b>He</b> <b>literally</b> cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

He {{restarted}} the program, but immediately injured his knee on a failed triple axel landing. This time he was too injured to restart, so he withdrew from the competition. Shortly after this competition, he switched club affiliation from the University of Delaware FSC to the Skating Club of New York, which he still represents.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder scored {{his first}} {{domestic}} commercial success with The Merchant of Four Seasons (Händler der vier Jahreszeiten, 1971). The film portrays {{a married couple}} who are fruit sellers. Hans faces rejection from his family after he violently assaults his wife for not bending to his will. She leaves him, but after he suffers a heart attack they reunite, though he now has to employ other men. His restricted ability to function leads him to ponder his own futility. <b>He</b> <b>literally</b> drinks himself to death.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Wright's final command {{assignment}} {{proved to}} be the most challenging undertaking in his career as <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> took on three concurrent roles, namely Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCLANT) and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) of NATO's Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT). While his nomination to become CINCLANTFLT and CINCLANT was made by the President of the United States, subject to the advice and consent of the United States Senate, Wright's appointment to become SACLANT was subject to the approval of the North Atlantic Council. Fortunately, Wright was a known commodity since he had served as the deputy U.S. representative to NATO's Standing Group from November 1950 to February 1952.|$|E

25|$|Professor Ebenezer Graham is a {{professor}} of Oriental languages, sent as an envoy to the Ottoman Empire navy on HMS Worcester in The Ionian Mission. He is stereotypical Scotsman: dour, humorless, and speaking with a broad Scots burr. He is also an inept secret agent, working for a branch of British intelligence service that is in conflict with Maturin's branch. Landing on the French coast on a secret mission, <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> shoots himself in the foot by accident, so that Maturin, on a secret mission of his own aborted by Graham's presence, takes Graham as his prize and puts him to work for the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Graham gains crucial information in The Ionian Mission by dint of his long connections with the Turks, and remains with Maturin on Malta in Treason's Harbour, describing one of the French spies on the island, Lesueur, becoming useful with more than his language skills. Graham does not enjoy Maturin's dry humor and nor Aubrey's high spirits and humor before battle, but comes to enjoy Maturin's company. When the new Commander-in-Chief arrives with his own Turkish consultant, Graham is sent home on short notice.|$|E
25|$|At {{the siege}} of Samarkand, Spitamenes used Bactrian horse archers in {{effective}} swarming attacks against a relief column sent by Alexander the Great. Bactrian horse archers surrounded various Macedonian phalanxes, staying {{out of range of}} their melee weapons, and fired arrows until they had no more. The archers would then withdraw to a supply point, but another swarm of horse archers would sometimes replace them, and sometimes attack elsewhere. The Bactrians eventually caused the phalanx to break formation, and destroyed it. Alexander recognized his forces could not directly combat horse archers, but that the horse archers needed resupply of provisions, horses, and arrows. Alexander split his forces into five columns and began building fortifications in the areas where the Bactrians had resupplied. Eventually, his anti-swarm tactics worked: cut off from resupply, the Bactrians had to meet the Macedonian phalanx, which were vastly superior in melee. Alexander made it priority to engage guerillas or other light mobile forces. Spitamenes was effective as long as his force were mobile, and he had adequate communications with mounted couriers. Once he was forced into direct battle with heavy forces, <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> lost his head. At the Battle of the Jaxartes River, Alexander once again faced swarming tactics from an army of Scythian horse archers. Alexander sent a unit of heavy cavalry ahead of his main line. As expected, the Scythian horsemen surrounded the detached cavalry. At the right moment, Alexander's cavalry reversed direction and pushed half of the Scythians straight into the main phalanx of Alexander's army, where they were slaughtered. Upon seeing this, the remaining half of the Scythian army retreated from the battle.|$|E

500|$|Banquo's other {{appearance}} as a ghost during the banquet scene {{serves as an}} indicator of Macbeth's conscience returning to plague his thoughts. Banquo's triumph over death appears symbolically, insofar as <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> takes Macbeth's seat during the feast. Shocked, Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation, describing Banquo as [...] "crowned" [...] with wounds. The spirit drains Macbeth's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks; as soon as Banquo's form vanishes, Macbeth announces: [...] "Why, so; being gone, / I am a man again." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison was {{expected}} to tour to promote the album, but at this time he had developed a phobia about performing that was especially problematic when appearing before large audiences. [...] John Platania was playing in concerts with Morrison and spoke of noticing his confidence ebbing away: [...] "There were many times when <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> had to be coaxed on stage. [...] His motto was 'The show {{does not have to}} go on'. He would create the choice of whether he would go on stage or not." [...] Morrison announced before an impending performance at a larger venue that he was retiring from performing live. After regaining his confidence by making regular and informal performances at a small club near his home, he began to tour coast-to-coast again in 1972.|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{incapable}} of self-reflection and unable to cope with pain. Hemingway conveys this through symbolism {{and a series of}} objective correlatives (tangible objects), which allow the reader insight to the character's motivations. For example, on his arrival in Seney <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> falls off the train, shocked {{at the sight of the}} burned town, but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience. Leaving behind the burnt landscape, Nick climbs a hill in the heat, and surveys the town's damage. The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war-torn Italy, but he hopes for regrowth: [...] "It could not all be burned. He knew that". At the top of the hill, he takes a break, smokes a cigarette, and speaks for the first time. Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity, lost in the war, which he is beginning to regain.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} not {{finished}} until {{the night before}} mastering. Chater had a flight to New York City at 7:30 in the morning. Di Blasi stated, [...] "so we’re in the studio till 6:30 that morning till <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> was like ‘I gotta go man, I gotta hop on the plane.’ We were like, ‘we think it sounds good. Fuck it.’" [...] Many tracks the Avalanches considered for Wildflower {{did not make it}} into the album because they did not contribute to its overall style. Collaborators on these songs included Jens Lekman, Connan Mockasin, [...] August Darnell, and Luke Steele. Once the style was more defined, they picked from tracks they had worked on which fell in line with others, similar to making a mix tape. The group intends to release these recordings that were closely related to Wildflower [...] "within a year or so" [...] of the album's release. This will help them [...] "clean the slate" [...] for new music to be made.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} feeling, so <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E

500|$|American {{historian}} Dana Munro {{wrote in}} her study about Latin America that PedroII [...] "grew up to be serious minded, irreproachable in his private life, and indefatigable {{in the performance of}} what he considered his duty." [...] She added that he was [...] "an able and intelligent ruler if not a great statesman". Another American historian writing on Brazilian history, Thomas Skidmore, remarked that the Emperor [...] "brought a natural talent to his work. Even at age 14, he was steady, equilibrated and discrete". He states that during [...] "his reign, he acquired the reputation of being just and objective, projecting the image of an honest and ethical sovereign who would not hesitate in disciplining politicians who were caught turning away from his strict standards". The British historian Roderick. J. Barman wrote in his biography of PedroII that he [...] "was at once the model emperor and the model citizen. <b>He</b> <b>literally</b> and metaphorically towered above his fellow Brazilians. PedroII's achievements at home and the high reputation he established abroad convinced Brazilians that the goals he advocated would create a country as powerful and as civilized as France, Great Britain or the United States".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} is a 1990s inverse of The Graduate archetype: [...] "a guy {{who does not have}} a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> cannot imagine a way to change his life." [...] He is confused and enraged, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean Übermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator would want to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life [...] "that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications". Fincher explained, [...] " [...] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't {{have anything to do with}} the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: You're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now." [...] While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be [...] "sinister and seditious", Fincher sought to make it [...] "funny and seditious" [...] by including humor to temper the sinister element.|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, and the fact that <b>he</b> <b>literally</b> saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
500|$|The {{progression}} of Anarky's abilities was also mirrored {{by the change}} in the character's costume. The design shift from an early suit intended to disguise Lonnie's age, to one that fit him more fully, was commented on by Norm Breyfogle, who wrote, [...] "…during his existence he's gained quite a few inches and pounds, filling out his costume! The change from black eyes to white may also be seen as indicating that Lonnie's real eyes now peer out of the mask. <b>He's</b> <b>literally</b> grown into the role!" ...|$|R
