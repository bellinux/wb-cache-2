50|$|Complementarity allows {{investment}} in one industry or sector to encourage {{investment in}} others. This concept of <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> {{is like a}} multiplier, because each investment triggers a series of subsequent events. Convergence occurs as the output of external economies diminishes at each step. Growth sequences tend to move towards convergence or divergence and the policy is usually concerned with preventing rapid convergence and promoting the possibility of divergence.|$|E
50|$|The major {{characteristic}} of the two paths of development is that they yield excess dividends. SOC built ahead of demand creates this demand by making a country more attractive to DPA investors. DPA that outpaces SOC development, creates demand to expand SOC. Balanced growth of DPA and SOC is not achievable in underdeveloped countries, nor {{it is not a}} desirable policy, as it does not set up the incentives and the pressure that make for this dividend of <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> decisions.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} case, the country invests in direct {{productive}} activities (DPA). Direct productive activity increases demand for SOC, <b>inducing</b> <b>investment.</b> In the second case, SOC expands, which reduces {{the cost of}} services, <b>inducing</b> <b>investment</b> in DPA.|$|R
30|$|Using {{a similar}} approach, Kramer et al.

(1995) and Kramer et al. (1997) have used <b>induced</b> <b>investments</b> to measure economic impact, these values are actually input to the firm’s innovation process that should be distinguished from its innovation outcome. According to Eurostat (2012), innovation outcome may be in the form of product innovation (e.g. sales from innovative products) or process innovation (e.g. productivity gain from innovative process) (Goldstein and Drucker 2006). The distinction between innovation input and innovation outcome indicators is clearly depicted in block 3 of the framework in Fig.  4.|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, {{we present}} a novel {{instrument}} to control for investment opportunities in studying the investment-cash-flow sensitivity. More in particular we introduce the book value of R&D. We argue this instrument has advantages over other theories of investment, especially when focussing on the corporate governance aspects of the investment-cash-flow sensitivity. On the other hand, it implies the investment-cash-flow sensitivity can only be studied in high-tech environments. These have corporate governance problems of their own. To investigate their effect, a signalling model is extended for R&D <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities, and estimated on a panel of Belgian data. ...|$|E
30|$|Based on the CDM model, we have {{classified}} {{the following}} indicators as input to the innovation process of firms: (a) corporate R&D stocks, (b) innovation expenditures, (c) corporate patents, (d) {{investment in building}} and equipment for R&D and (e) induced investments. In particular, Pressman et al. (1995, p. 30) surveyed a sample of MIT licensees by collecting information on their <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> defined as “Money spent developing new products and efficient ways to produce and market these products. It excludes the costs of producing (or investment required to produce) mature products”. From the survey, they extrapolated their data to estimate an economic impact of US$ 922 million.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what <b>induces</b> <b>investment</b> in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against inducement to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.|$|R
30|$|These three market {{failures}} explained before give {{fundamental to the}} argument of incipient industry: the creation of rents {{for the promotion of}} punctual strategic economic sectors. For that reason, Aubert et al. (2011) establish a model of National Champions relying in the stage of the firm’s life. Subsidies for young and innovative firms are justified when rents <b>induce</b> <b>investment</b> in activities that, by their own, firms won’t invest in. For mature firms, protection would be useful if it <b>induces</b> <b>investments</b> on expensive innovations that were impossible for the firm to cover, even with credit. The key aspect is to avoid subsidies and protection for firms without incentives to make innovative investments (Aubert et al. 2011, p. 73). Finally, for the authors this analysis leaves another important lesson. Even when protection tools such as tariffs introduce an inefficient delay in the relocation of resources between economic activities, they are cheaper than subsidies, situation extremely important for underdeveloped countries where public budget constraints are the rule (Aubert et al. 2011, p. 75).|$|R

40|$|Does {{ownership}} {{affect the}} way firms react to corporate taxation? This paper exploits key features of recent corporate tax reforms in China {{to shed light on}} the differential impact of taxation on firms under different ownership regimes including private, collectively owned and state owned companies. Employing a difference-in-difference estimation approach, we find that the increase in the deductibility of wage costs in 2006 has led to a sizable increase of wages per worker in private firms and an even larger increase in collective-owned enterprises. In contrast, there is no significant wage response in state owned enterprises. The decrease in the statutory tax rate for domestic firms since 2008 has induced collectively owned enterprises and private firms to reduce debt while there is no significant response SOEs. Our results also suggest that the 2008 reform has reduced tax <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> round tripping through Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of oil-related developments on output, incomes and employment in Shetland. An Input-Output approach is adopted based on a Shetland transactions table constructed by the author. Using this, the pre-oil Shetland economy is analysed as base for assessing oil impact. Three major oil activities are identified and their local effects estimated: Supply Bases, the Sullom Voe Tanker Terminal, and Oil-related Construction. Estimates of {{the impact of}} these on local activity are given in aggregate and on an individual industry basis. Appropriate oil sector 'multipliers' are derived. Attempts are made to modify the basic estimates by allowing for 'negative multiplier' effects, <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> and other elements of impact excluded in the basic model. Finally, the possibility of oil-induced changes in local technology is considered and its implications for the preceding impact estimates discussed. In the conclusions the results of the previous analysis are drawn together and some policy implications suggested by them are considered briefly...|$|E

40|$|Early rural {{electrification}} programmes, relying upon grid connected power, were once {{hailed as the}} catalytic drivers of rural development. However experience has shown that their impact upon indigenous rural growth has been minimal and the associated benefits have not been forthcoming. Alternatively, the advent of commercially available renewable energy technologies has injected renewed optimism into the RE camp. Because {{they are able to}} devolve many of the income and employment opportunities associated with energy generation to the local community, it means that pre-electrification programmes using decentralised renewable energy systems, have the potential to succeed where conventional energies have failed. The aim of this study is therefore to assess their propensity to effect socio-economic reform via the positive benefits they procure on local employment and income distributions. To this end, the effect of a capital investment in renewable energy generation is evaluated under a Keynesian Income Multiplier methodology. The model formulation attempts to capture the full income and employment effects derived from the installation, whilst also accounting for capital import leakages, <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities, labour markets extensions and in-migration. The model is applied to the installation of a 3 MW windfarm on the Isle of Islay. To establish the economic base, Islay’s existing socio-economic structure is detailed in terms of economic activity and industrial distribution, as is the windfarm’s expenditure. Although the windfarm does not generate substantial long term employment effects or any significant <b>induced</b> <b>investment,</b> its local expenditure in respect of land rental is found to fulfil its role as a driver of indigenous growth. Supplementary comment is thereafter given in respect of the model’s application in less developed countries, where it is noted that many of the limitations found in the Islay case study, do not present the same negative ramifications in less developed countries. The study concludes that if renewable energy technologies are to stimulate rural indigenous growth, then it is not simply enough to reconcile a region’s natural resource base with the local energy requirements, but rather, they should attempt to maximise local participation in terms of labour and/or products in both the long and short term. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} strategic decentralization, bargaining, and transfer pricing in supply chain efficiency. The first essay analyzes how strategic delegation using stock options can affect investment hold-up problems in vertical relationships. In vertical relationships, underinvestment problems can arise because sunk invest-ment costs are ignored in ex post negotiation. However, the delegation of bargaining rights to the upstream manager coupled with stock options makes the sunk invest-ment costs relevant costs from the manager's perspective. The sunk investment costs are now reversible depending on his exercise decision. Thus, under option-based com-pensation, the relevant investment costs create the upstream manager's bargaining power and thereby increase transaction price in negotiation. The resulting increased transaction price improves the upstream profit and the improved return on invest-ment induces greater investment by the upstream firm. Despite the higher induced transaction price, the downstream firm's profit can also improve because the greater <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> enhances {{the viability of the}} supply chain. Such supply chain gains also naturally translate into gains in consumer surplus...|$|E

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{unstable}} and low economic activity, Brazil achieved a relatively high economic growth with low inflation from 2004 to 2008, when the world scenario was favourable for the Brazilian trade balance. An incomes policy, focused on real increases in the minimum wage along with a credit boom, led to a decade of high consumption growth rates. High levels of consumption and exports, in turn, <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> and stimulated manufacturing production, despite the real appreciation of the national currency. However, the Great Recession that emerged after the global financial crisis of 2007 / 2008 brought challenges to the Brazilian economic performance, with unpleasant consequences for the country’s GDP growth. Consumption, investment and exports have decelerated, despite anti-cyclical macroeconomic policies. In this setting, manufacturing production stagnated and GDP growth slowed down substantially, while imports continued rising considerably. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide an explanation to the slowdown of Brazilian growth rates after the Great Recession. The main hypothesis is that consumption was the main source of effective demand in the country since 2003. However, Brazil has not yet been able to sustain manufacturing and economic growth without a more active government policy to stimulate productive investment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{investigate}} how the accounting measurement basis a¤ects the capital market pricing of a 8 ̆ 5 rms shares, which, in turn, a¤ects the e ¢ ciency of the 8 ̆ 5 rms investment decisions. We distinguish two broad bases for accounting measurements: input-based and output-based accounting. We {{argue that the}} structural di¤erence in the two measurement bases leads to a systematic di¤erence in the e ¢ ciency of the investment decisions. In particular, we show that an output-based measure, such as a fair value measure, has a natural advantage in aligning investment incentives because of its comprehensiveness. The (8 ̆ 5 rst-) best investment is achieved when the output-based measure is noiseless and manipulation-free. However, in practice, output-based measures may be highly noisy and easy to manipulate, {{in which case the}} <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> e ¢ ciency can be quite low. This is because under an output-based measure, investment ine ¢ ciency and accounting noise/manipulability are always complements: more accounting noise/manipulation leads to more ine ¢ cient investment choices. On the other hand, an input-based measure, such as a historical cost measure, may induce more e ¢ cient investment decisions than an output-based measure even though it is not as comprehensive. The reason is two-fold. First, input-based measures are typically associated with less noise and limited manipulation. Second and mor...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the daily closing price performance of ZSE listed securities post enactment and subsequent {{adoption of the}} Indigenous Economic Empowerment Act by the Government of Zimbabwe. A desk analysis of the closing daily trading prices of the largest counters, by market capitalization, traded on the stock exchange for the period January to April 2010 is made. Interview and questionnaire responses from day traders show a high negative correlation between the promulgation of the Act and the daily trading prices of all counters traded on the ZSE. First difference tests on the counters ’ price movements yielded strong correlation coefficients which seem to suggest Granger causality between the share price movements and {{the passing of the}} Act. Further findings reveal that closing prices of all the largest counters traded on the ZSE were adversely affected by the Act. As a rule, empowerment laws should not significantly and adversely affect trading prices. However, historical backgrounds seem to suggest evidence of rampant systemic inefficiencies resulting from previous empowerment policies implemented in Zimbabwe. This background seems to have <b>induced</b> <b>investment</b> phobia and apprehension among investors. This fear appears to have scared away investors, initially from trading in counters whose ownership structures are likely to be affected by empowerment policies, and ultimately all the other counters. This behaviour affects the daily closing prices of listed securities.
