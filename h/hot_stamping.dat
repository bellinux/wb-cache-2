40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is generally}} directed to catalyzed <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> methods for polishing and/or patterning carbon nanotube-containing substrates. In some embodiments, the substrate, as a carbon nanotube fiber end, {{is brought into}} contact with a <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> (typically at 200 - 800 ° C.), and is kept {{in contact with the}} <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> until the morphology/patterns on the <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> have been transferred to the substrate. In some embodiments, the <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> is made of material comprising one or more transition metals (Fe, Ni, Co, Pt, Ag, Au, etc.), which can catalyze the etching reaction of carbon with H 2, CO 2, H 2 O, and/or O 2. Such methods can (1) polish the carbon nanotube-containing substrate with a microscopically smooth finish, and/or (2) transfer pre-defined patterns from the <b>hot</b> <b>stamp</b> to the substrate. Such polished or patterned carbon nanotube substrates can find application as carbon nanotube electrodes, field emitters, and field emitter arrays for displays and electron sources...|$|R

In this work, Usibor 1500 steel was <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> using water-cooled prototype mould. Micro structural analyses as well as tensile tests and hardness measurements of <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> samples were performed. The results showed that most of austenite microstructure was changed into martensite by the hot forming. The tensile strength and hardness value were up to 1485 MPa and 492 HV 1, respectively.

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>stamping</b> (also {{known as}} press {{hardening}} or hot press forming) {{is a relatively}} new technology which allows ultra-high strength steels (typically 22MnB5) to be formed into complex shapes, which is not possible with regular cold stamping operations.|$|E
50|$|Commonly applied {{materials}} include cobalt-based alloys (such as stellite), nickel-based alloys, {{chromium carbide}} alloys and NOREM.

50|$|Cold foil {{evolved from}} <b>hot</b> foil <b>stamping.</b> <b>Hot</b> foil <b>stamping</b> is mostly used offline when foil is {{required}} on a preprinted substrate, {{such as in}} the manufacture of greeting cards and special occasion ribbons. Hot foil is economical but very slow. The types of graphics that can be applied are usually limited to text and bold images. Hot foil is not usable with heat-sensitive substrates such as polyethylene, vinyl, or shrink film.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to collect casino chips. Because {{of the amount of}} chips available and the increasing price of some, collectors have begun to specialize. A collector might choose to collect every chip from a certain casino or one from every Las Vegas casino. Collecting by denomination is also very popular, such as only $1 or $5 chips. The first rule of proper care and storage is to keep them away from sunlight and fluorescent light. The best way to store a collection is to keep them in a folder. As opposed to a coin collection, cleaning the chips will not decrease their value but is still not recommended unless really necessary. Chips have inlays and <b>hot</b> <b>stamps</b> on them which can get unreadable over the time if they are not maintained properly. The <b>hot</b> <b>stamps</b> and the inlays of the chips are what determine their value so it is very critical to ensure that these are not severely damaged while handling them. Collectors especially should be careful and maintain their rare chips effectively to keep their value intact.|$|R

50|$|Structure {{rigidity}} {{is improved}} and weight reduced through {{increased use of}} high-strength steel. Overall, 64% of the total vehicle body mass is high strength steel (HSS), aluminum and magnesium. HSS makes up 59% of vehicle body mass; 1,500 MPa yield strength steel makes up 7%. A single ring-like <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> HSS component reinforces the A-pillar, roof rail, B-pillar, and lower floor rail encircling the front doors for improved crash protection.

40|$|In an {{automotive}} crash event, <b>hot</b> <b>stamped,</b> die quenched martensitic structural components {{have been}} shown to provide excellent intrusion resistance. These alloys exhibit only limited ductility, however, which may limit the overall impact performance of the component. The introduction of lower strength and more ductile “tailored” properties within some regions of a <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> component has the potential to improve impact performance. One approach being applied to achieving such tailored properties is through locally controlling the cooling rate within the stamping die. The primary motivation for the current work is to understand the role of cooling rate on the as-quenched mechanical response of tailored hot stampings, which has required characterization of the high strain rate mechanical behaviour of tailored <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> boron steel. The effect of cooling rate and resulting microstructure on the as-quenched mechanical behavior of USIBOR® 1500 P boron steel at strain rates between 10 - 3 and 103 s- 1 was investigated. Specimens quenched at rates above the critical cooling rate (~ 27 °C/s) exhibited a fully martensitic microstructure with a UTS of ~ 1, 450 MPa. Sub-critical cooling rates, in the range 14 °C/s to 50 °C/s, resulted in as-quenched microstructures ranging between bainitic to martensitic, respectively. Tension tests revealed that predominantly bainitic material conditions (14 °C/s cooling rate) exhibited a lower UTS of 816 MPa compared to 1, 447 MPa for the fully martensitic material condition (50 °C/s cooling rate) with a corresponding increase in elongation from 0. 10 to 0. 15 for the bainitic condition. The reduction in area was 70 % for the bainitic material condition and 58 % for the martensitic material conditions which implied that a tailored region consisting of bainite may be a desirable candidate for implementation within a <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> component. The strain rate sensitivity was shown to be moderate for all of the as-quenched material conditions and the measured flow stress curves were used to develop a strain rate sensitive constitutive model, the “Tailored Crash Model (TCM) ”. The TCM accurately reproduced the measured flow stress curves as a function of effective plastic strain, strain rate and Vickers hardness (or area fraction of martensite and bainite). The effect of deformation during quenching and the associated shift in the CCT diagram on the subsequent constitutive response was also examined for this material. Specimens were simultaneously quenched and deformed at various cooling rates to achieve a range of as-quenched microstructures that included ferrite in addition to martensite and bainite. Tensile tests conducted on these specimens at strain rates ranging from 0. 003 s- 1 to ~ 80 s- 1 revealed that the presence of ferrite resulted in an increase in uniform elongation and n-value which increased overall energy absorption for a given hardness level. The strain rate sensitivity was shown to be moderate for all of the as-quenched material conditions and the TCM constitutive model was extended to account for the presence of ferrite. This extended constitutive model, the “Tailored Crash Model II (TCM II) ”, has been shown to predict flow stress as a function of effective plastic strain, strain rate and area fraction of martensite, bainite and ferrite. As a validation exercise, uniaxial tension test simulations of specimens extracted from the transition zone of a <b>hot</b> <b>stamped</b> lab-scale B-pillar with tailored properties [1] were performed. The measured hardness distribution along the gauge length of the tensile specimens was used as input for the TCM constitutive model to define the element constitutive response used in the finite element (FE) models. The measured stress versus strain response and strain distribution during loading (measured using digital image correlation) was in excellent agreement with the FE models and thus validated the TCM constitutive model developed in this work. Validation of the TCM II version of the model is left for future work...|$|R

5000|$|Another area of {{innovation}} for Tony Jr. {{has been the}} pick imprinting processes. From the very beginning, simple <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> {{had been used to}} identify the picks, first with a D'Andrea logo and then simple block letter dies for a player name. These were originally imprinted in one shot, foot pedal operated machines. One of the first to make the player imprint popular was Nick Lucas. In the 1930s, using the old round top #351 pick Luigi developed for him, each pick was imprinted with his logo and sold as a [...] "Nick Lucas" [...] pick. The 1950s saw the advent of mass-producing private labeled picks for guitar companies, requiring sophisticated automated printing and packaging. The 1960s was the heyday of rock and every player and store wanted their pick personalized. Tony developed some of the fastest multi-shot equipment for punching, imprinting and bagging. In the 1990s he revolutionized the imprint process with the introduction of pad printing. It overcame some of the speed and design limitations of <b>hot</b> <b>stamping.</b> Now very intricate logos can be produced by computer generation and they can be multicolored. By 1996, even a photograph could be imprinted on a pick! ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{good example}} of where laser {{engraving}} technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products traveling along a production line. Laser marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked [...] "on the move". The location where the marking takes place is called a [...] "marking laser station", an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> and pad printing have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.|$|E

50|$|A {{hologram}} may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein {{an extremely}} {{thin layer of}} only a few micrometers of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a hot-melt adhesive (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.When incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes.

This process — which he named [...] "Microfusion" [...] — used cold vinyl powder sprayed into a metal mold (which looked somewhat like a round waffle iron), each one of which was then placed into a <b>hot</b> <b>stamping</b> press, the heat and pressure of which would melt the particles of plastic, and fuse them together while simultaneously imprinting the surface of each side of the record them with a negative image of the positive image of the record grooves that had been molded onto each side of the metal mold (the two sides were hinged together, which increased the waffle-iron resemblance.
