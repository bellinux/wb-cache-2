5|$|Some Muslims, {{especially}} those living near the southern coast, took {{the option of}} exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> forbidden by Islamic law.|$|E

40|$|This {{second edition}} of the best selling {{textbook}} <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Beverage</b> Management has been updated and revised {{to take account of}} current trends within the hospitality industry. In particular the consideration of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> (or foodservice) operations is clearly set within a broader business framework with more consideration being given to the management of foodservice operations within a changing business environment. The underlying thinking behind much of this text relies on the application of a systems approach to the management of operations. The text therefore proposes systematic approaches to the design, planning <b>and</b> control of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> operations, <b>and</b> also recognises the need to manage operations as operating systems. The book considers a <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> operation as comprising three distinct but interlinked systems: <b>food</b> production, <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> service as a delivery system <b>and</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> service as a customer process system.
