40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to compare the effect of hand and rotary {{instruments}} on fracture strength of tooth roots. MATERIALS & METHODS: Thirty two teeth were randomly divided into two experimental groups of 15 each and one negative control group with two samples. In group 1, step-back technique with conventional stainless steel K-files was used, and in group 2, instrumentation was performed using rotary Ni-Ti Hero 642. Samples in control group did not received cleaning or shaping after access cavity preparation. After obturating each canal, tip of the spreader was locked within canal. The required force for root fracture was measured using Instron testing machine. Recorded data was statistically analyzed using t-test. RESULTS: The mean and standard <b>deviation</b> <b>force</b> required for vertical root fracture were 50. 33 ± 19. 1 and 63. 1 ± 25. 46 N for hand and rotary groups respectively. However, no {{significant difference was found}} between experimental groups.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimum {{design of a}} lightweight vehicle levitation electromagnet, which also provides a passive guide force in a magnetic levitation system for contactless delivery applications. The split alignment of C-shaped electromagnets about C-shaped rails has a bad effect on the lateral <b>deviation</b> <b>force,</b> therefore, no-split positioning of electromagnets is better for lateral performance. This is verified by simulations and experiments. This paper presents a statistically optimized design with {{a high number of}} the design variables to reduce the weight of the electromagnet under the constraint of normal force using response surface methodology (RSM) and the kriging interpolation method. 2 D and 3 D magnetostatic analysis of the electromagnet are performed using ANSYS. The most effective design variables are extracted by a Pareto chart. The most desirable set is determined and the influence of each design variable on the objective function can be obtained. The generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm is adopted in the kriging model. This paper’s procedure is validated by a comparison between experimental and calculation results, which shows that the predicted performance of the electromagnet designed by RSM is in good agreement with the simulation results...|$|E

Methods: Fifteen men and five women {{with a mean age}} of 64 years (range 42 to 78 years) whose daily activity was substantially impaired by severe airflow obstruction and hyperinflation underwent thoracoscopic volume reduction surgery. The prospective preoperative assessment and postoperative assessment at 3 months included (1) pulmonary function studies, (2) grading of dyspnea, and (3) exercise performance; pulmonary function tests were also performed immediately before discharge from the hospital. Results: There was no perioperative mortality. All patients left the hospital after a median stay of 15 days (6 to 27 days). Only seven patients had a prolonged chest tube drainage time (> 7 days). At 3 months the mean (± standard <b>deviation)</b> <b>forced</b> expiratory volume in 1 second had improved by 42 % (± 3. 8 %), from 0. 80 L (± 0. 23) to 1. 09 L (± 0. 28) (p < 0. 001); residual volume had decreased from 5. 8 L (± 1. 5) to 4. 4 L (± 1. 0) (p < 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the relationship between the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders at the wrists and the characteristics of the work conditions in terms of angles, forces, repetitiveness, and movement velocities. METHODS: Nine workplaces were selected and the prevalence of wrist disorders was determined by means of a questionnaire for both arms separately, along with characteristics of the 335 subjects (age, weight, height, seniority). A work analysis was performed on subjects selected at random from each workplace by recording, for both wrists during a representative number of work cycles, the angles both in radial and ulnar deviations and in flexion-extension and the surface electromyogram on the hand flexors of the forearm. Repetitiveness (defined as the number of transitions per minute) and movement velocities (in deviation and flexion-extension) were derived from the recordings of the angles. RESULTS: All the derived variables were highly correlated, greater angles and greater forces being associated with greater velocities and higher repetitiveness. A multivariate linear regression model for the prediction of the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders of the wrist was constructed (R = 0. 904). Height, weight, seniority, angles in radial-ulnar <b>deviation,</b> and <b>forces</b> were significant and independent predictors of the prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of wrist disorders is significantly linked to wrist angles in <b>deviation</b> and to <b>forces</b> exerted. Due to their high correlation with force, the repetitiveness indices and velocities, as defined, do not appear to play an additional role. Further research is needed to find alternative ways of characterizing repetitiveness...|$|R

We define the proper execution of programs {{written in a}} small assembly language that includes memory accesses, nested closed and open transactions, partial rollback, commit and abort handlers, thread spawning, and escape actions. This is a working document, intended to reflect and codify the current best understanding of LogTM’s operation in both common and corner cases. This formal semantics serves as a reference companion to other published discussions of LogTM, and specifically corresponds to the system described in “Supporting Nested Transactional Memory in LogTM ” by Moravan et al. 1 Purpose and Status of This Document This document presents a formal operational semantics for the LogTM hardware transactional memory system. We define a small assembly language of memory accesses and transaction operations, and state the required behavior of any LogTM implementation when executing programs in this language. Some implementation-specific behavior is identified but intentionally left unspecified. Additionally, this semantics models a forward log whereas current LogTM implementations use backward logs. This intentional <b>deviation</b> <b>forces</b> the semantics to be less dependent on the particulars of any given implementation. This document is dense in mathematical notation with only a minimum of explanatory prose. It {{is not intended to}} be read alone, but rather should be treated as a reference companion to other published descriptions of the LogTM architecture and implementation [2, 3]. Specifically, we describe the behavior of the nested LogTM system of Moravan et al. [3]. We hope that this document will be particularly useful for documenting LogTM’s behavior in complex corner cases that other treatments may hint at but not codify in detail. A formal semantics of this nature is of similar complexity to program code, and furthermore has not been mechanically tested or verified.

Because these effects originate from IR physics below the Planck scale, they will dominate over any trans-Planckian imprints in any theory which obeys decoupling. Inflation sweeps away these initial <b>deviations</b> and <b>forces</b> its quantum state closer to the thermal vacuum. We view this as the quantum version of the cosmic no-hair theorem. Such imprints in the CMB may be a useful, independent test of the duration of inflation, or of significant features in the inflaton potential about 60 e-folds before inflation ended, instead of an unlikely discovery of the signatures of quantum gravity.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} control of force magnitude, but relatively little research has considered force direction control. The subjects applied isometric forces to a handle and the authors compared within-trial variability when force is produced in different directions. The standard <b>deviation</b> of the <b>force</b> parallel to the prescribed direction of force production increased linearly with the targeted force level, as did the standard <b>deviation</b> of the <b>force</b> perpendicular to the instructed direction. In contrast, the standard deviation of the angle of force production decreased with increased force level. In the 4 (of 8) instructed force directions where the endpoint force was generated due to a joint torque in only 1 joint (either the shoulder or elbow) the principal component axes in force space were well aligned with the prescribed direction of force production. In the other directions, the variance was approximately equal along the 2 force axes. The variance explained by the first principal component was significantly larger in torque space compared to the force space, and mostly corresponded to positive correlation between the joint torques. Such coordinated changes suggest that the torque variability was mainly due to the variability of the common drive to the muscles serving 2 joints, although this statement needs to be supported by direct studies of muscle activation in the future. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Local {{convection}} theory {{makes the}} unphysical prediction that turbulent mixing terminates at the Schwarzschild stability boundary, and existing non-local convection theories {{have been criticized}} by Renzini (1987). Since the size of convecting cores bears upon stellar structure and evolution, a self-consistent treatment of non-local convection is needed. We have developed a theory of non-local mixing-length convection based upon a Boltzman transport theory for subsonic, turbulent fluid elements. The momentum and thermal energy excesses of fluid elements are dissipated {{on the scale of}} a mixing length. The distribution function, f(t,z,v,T), which is the mass density per velocity-temperature phase space volume, evolves according to the Boltzmann equation. The minimal non-local theory is obtained by taking moments of the Boltzmann equation, up to third order. The local limit of the moment equations reduces to standard mixing-length theory. We extend this moment method to local convection in a composition stratified fluid by considering the evolution of the distribution function, f(t,z,v,T,μ), in velocity-temperature-molecular weight phase space. The stability criteria for convection, semiconvection, and salt-finger instability are derived. To determine closure approximations and evaluate the validity of the moment theory, we have developed an algorithm called Generalized Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (GSPH) that numerically simulates convection. The vertical structure of the background fluid is calculated by SPH averaging of particles on a grid. Forces on particles are calculated from the background grid and from the local deviations between particles and grid. Particles move vertically only, but the local <b>deviation</b> <b>forces,</b> which account for turbulent losses of momentum and energy, arise from horizontal interactions. GSPH simulations show that the fourth moments are approximately proportional to squares of the second moments in unstable regions, with a proportionality constant between 2 and 4. With this closure approximation, we show that solutions of the moment equations agree well with GSPH results. The closure relations lead to nearly correct second moments, even in overshooting regions where the closure approximations are poor. GSPH simulations of convective overshooting in plane parallel and spherical geometry typically give overshooting distances in the range dₒᵥₑᵣ ≈ 1 - 2 ℓ(M). We discuss improvements that we would like to make to the GSPH code and to the analytic work to obtain more precise answers that are directly relevant to realistic stars...|$|R

The relevance of haptic feedback in robot-assisted performances of surgical tasks is controversial. We studied {{the effects of}} visual force feedback, a haptic feedback surrogate, on tying surgical knots with fine sutures {{similar to those used}} in cardiovascular surgery. MethodsBy using a modified da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, Calif) equipped with force-sensing instrument tips and real-time visual force feedback overlays in the console image, 10 surgeons each tied 10 knots with and 10 knots without visual force feedback. Four surgeons had significant prior da Vinci experience, and the remaining 6 surgeons did not. Performance parameters, including suture breakage and secure knots, peak and standard <b>deviation</b> of applied <b>forces,</b> and completion times using 5 - 0 silk sutures, were recorded. Chi-square and Student t test analyses determined the differences between groups. ResultsAmong surgeon subjects with robotic experience, no differences in measured performance parameters were found between robot-assisted knot ties executed with and without visual force feedback. Among surgeons without robotic experience, however, visual force feedback was associated with lower suture breakage rates, peak applied <b>forces,</b> and standard <b>deviations</b> of applied <b>forces.</b> Visual force feedback did not impart differences in knot completion times or loose knots for either surgeon group. ConclusionsVisual force feedback resulted in reduced suture breakage, lower forces, and decreased force inconsistencies among novice robotic surgeons, although elapsed time and knot quality were unaffected.

To improve form cutter accuracy, a closed-loop control system was designed to accomplish control of envelope process. For complicated dynamic process, fuzzy controller is used to adjust parameters online. By measuring grinding force, characteristic information of grinding process is acquired. Regulation factor of feed rate is determined by grinding <b>force</b> ratio, <b>force</b> <b>deviation</b> and its change rate used as evaluation indexes. Thus, fuzzy control of constant force grinding process is accomplished. Simulation and cutter grinding test indicates that the system has high precision and stability, and reduces cutter error effectively...|$|R
