This paper {{presents}} findings from a numerical study of <b>intake</b> valve jet <b>flapping</b> within a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine, using a large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modelling approach. The experimental test case and computational setup, including choice of sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence model, are presented and discussed. An example cycle where <b>intake</b> valve jet <b>flapping</b> is seen to be prominent is discussed in detail. <b>Intake</b> valve jet <b>flapping</b> {{was found to be}} initiated as a consequence of turbulent fluctuations in the intake valve curtains. Cycle-by-cycle variations in valve curtain mass flux and the subsequent jet flapping events are investigated and significant cyclic variability is found. It was observed that when an ensemble-averaging procedure, typically used in LES simulations and experimental PIV data post-processing, is applied, due to the cyclic variability of the variations in valve curtain mass flux, most of the information related to this flow phenomenon is lost...|$|R

50|$|The BAC 167 Strikemaster is {{essentially}} an armed version of the Jet Provost T Mk 5; the Strikemaster was modified with an uprated engine, wing hardpoints capable of carrying 4 500 pound Mk82 bombs, two machine guns under the <b>intakes,</b> uprated <b>flap</b> system with two jacks, larger airbrake jacks, new communication and navigation gear, different electrical system, canopy breakers on the ejection seats, and a revised fuel system including conformal fuel tanks on the wing tips. First flown in 1967, the aircraft was marketed as a light attack or counter-insurgency aircraft, but most large-scale purchasers were air forces wanting an advanced trainer, although Ecuador, Oman and Yemen have used their aircraft in combat. A total of 146 were built.|$|R

5000|$|The Himmelstürmer (figurative translation: [...] "Sky Trooper" [...] but {{literally}} [...] "heaven stormer" [...] ) Flightpack, or Einpersonenfluggerät, was a flightpack {{invented by}} Nazi Germany {{late in the}} war Its intention was not to achieve flight for the user, but to jump over obstacles and waterways {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to traverse on foot. The jetpack, or flightpack consisted of a larger rocket on the back for propulsion, and a smaller one on the front for steering. The propulsion was achieved by the use of a Schmidt pulse jet, [...] developed originally by Paul Schmidt (inventor) who submitted preliminary design patents as early as 1931. Though he didn't invent the pulse engine, engineer Paul Schmidt (inventor), pioneered a more efficient design based on modification of the <b>intake</b> valves (or <b>flaps),</b> earning him government support from the German Air Ministry in 1933. The same pulse technology was utilised in V1 rockets, albeit in larger form, which Schmidt was also involved with.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The GDI engine {{has a number of}} practical advantages over the more traditional port-fuel injection strategy, however a number of challenges remain the subject of continued research in an attempt to fully exploit the advantages of the GDI engine. These include complex in-cylinder flow fields and fuel-air mixing strategies, and significant temporal variation, both through an engine cycle and on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Despite advances in experimental techniques, the relative difficulty and cost of taking detailed measurements remains high, thus computational techniques {{are an integral part of}} research activities. The research work presented in this thesis has focused on the use of detailed 3 D-CFD techniques for investigating physical phenomena of the in-cylinder flow field and fuel injection process in a single cylinder GDI engine with early injection event. A detailed validation of the numerical predictions of the in-cylinder flow field using both the RANS RNG k-ε turbulence model and the Smagorinsky LES SGS turbulence model was completed with both models showing good agreement against available experimental results. A detailed validation of the numerical predictions of the fuel injection process using a Lagrangian DDM and both RANS RNG k-ε turbulence model and Smagorinsky LES SGS turbulence model was completed with both models showing excellent agreement against experimental data. The model was then used to investigate the in-cylinder flow field and fuel injection process including research into: the three dimensional nature of the flow field; <b>intake</b> valve jet <b>flapping,</b> characterisation, causality and CCV, and whether it could account for CCV of the mixture field at spark timing; the anisotropic characteristics of the flow field using both the fluctuating velocity and turbulence intensity, including the increase in anisotropy due to the fuel injection event; the use of POD for quantitatively analysing the in-cylinder flow field; investigations into the intake valve, cylinder liner and piston crown spray plume impingement processes, including the use of a multi-component fuel surrogate and CCV of the formed liquid film; characterisation and CCV of the mixture field though the intake and compression strokes up to spark timing. Finally, the predicted turbulence characteristics were used to evaluate the resultant premixed turbulent combustion event using combustion regime diagrams...|$|R
