5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, {{the state}} <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} ouster clauses is still unclear. Whereas in the United Kingdom the courts have abolished the distinction between non-jurisdictional and jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and affirmed that in general ouster clauses are ineffective against <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> Singapore cases seem to adopt the traditional pre-Anisminic approach. The distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{and the effectiveness of}} ouster clauses against non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is exemplified by the cases of Re Application by Yee Yut Ee (1978), and Stansfield Business International Pte. Ltd. v. Minister for Manpower (1999).|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only to observe that the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|In his judgment, Lord Reid {{also took}} the {{opportunity}} {{to deal with the issue}} of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> While recognizing the traditional understanding that jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> are <b>of</b> no effect, his Lordship also stated that there are many cases where although the decision-maker has jurisdiction to decide, the determination is also a nullity. He then gave a non-exhaustive list of these cases: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} in Anisminic rendered obsolete {{the distinction between}} <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{on the face of}} the record and other <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> by extending the doctrine of ultra vires. Thenceforward it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires.|$|R
25|$|Thus, in English law all {{errors of}} law are {{now to be}} {{considered}} as jurisdictional and ultra vires in a broad sense of the term. This implies that ouster clauses should not be effective against any <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> The Anisminic principle was upheld by the Supreme Court in R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal (2011) so that {{the rule of law}} is promoted, among other reasons. Since it is practically immaterial to the victim of an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> whether it is a jurisdictional error or otherwise, it would be manifestly unjust if judicial review was precluded when a non-jurisdictional error was egregious and obvious, but allowed for a small jurisdictional error.|$|E
25|$|Ouster clauses may {{be divided}} into two species– total ouster clauses and partial ouster clauses. In the United Kingdom, the {{effectiveness}} of total ouster clauses is fairly limited. In the case of Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Committee (1968), the House of Lords held that ouster clauses cannot prevent the courts from examining an executive decision that, due to an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> is a nullity. Subsequent cases held that Anisminic had abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. Thus, although prior to Anisminic an ouster clause was effective in preventing judicial review where only a non-jurisdictional <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> was involved, following that case ouster clauses do not prevent courts from dealing with both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law, except in a number of limited situations.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, a {{distinction}} was drawn between jurisdictional errors {{of law and}} non-jurisdictional errors of law. A jurisdictional <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> was committed when a public authority made a decision or took some action even though it lacked jurisdiction to do so, for example, if the process was tainted by simple ultra vires. In this event, the High Court could judicially review the matter. On the other hand, a non-jurisdictional <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> occurred when an authority was properly empowered {{to make a decision}} or take action, but it was alleged that the authority had exercised its discretion in breach of some administrative law principle. In such cases, the Court was not allowed to intervene by exercising judicial review, save in certain circumstances such as a breach of natural justice. This distinction applied both to the exercise of power by public authorities and to courts and tribunals.|$|E
2500|$|The Anisminic {{principle}} {{applies only}} to public bodies exercising executive functions, over which the courts can exercise their supervisory role and {{have the power to}} decide questions <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> However, superior courts do not have any supervisory function in relation to inferior courts <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> because Parliament is deemed to have intended that such courts are to be final arbiters <b>of</b> questions <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Whether the decision of a court <b>of</b> <b>law</b> is final and not subject to judicial review depends on a construction of the statute defining the jurisdiction and powers of the court. In Re Racal Communications Ltd. (1980), Lord Diplock noted that if a statute provides that the court's decision should be final and conclusive, the [...] "subtle distinctions formerly drawn between <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> which go to jurisdiction and <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> which do not" [...] survive. Hence, any non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> made by a court can be only corrected by appeal if the statute provides for it.|$|R

25|$|The {{decision}} {{illustrates the}} courts' reluctance {{to give effect to}} any legislative provision {{that attempts to}} exclude their jurisdiction in judicial review.

25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016.

While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E

25|$|The passage {{suggests}} that the Court continued to draw a distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law. However, since the decision {{was based on a}} breach of natural justice, the Court's remarks were, strictly speaking, obiter dicta. Also, the judge in Stansfield was speaking about the scope of judicial review where the statute in question contained an ouster clause; it is possible that different considerations apply in that situation. The rest of this article assumes that, at least where ouster clauses are not involved, Singapore law and UK law are the same – that is, the High Court may exercise judicial review whether a public authority has committed an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that would traditionally have been regarded as jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional.|$|E
25|$|In Yee Yut Ee, the High Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses.

25|$|The writ {{of error}} coram nobis {{was one of}} the oldest {{remedies}} of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.|$|E
500|$|Later {{cases have}} treated Anisminic as {{implying}} that any action committed in error by an administrative agency or body is deemed {{to affect the}} jurisdiction of the body to carry out the action, and hence is reviewable by a court <b>of</b> <b>law</b> despite the ouster clause. The blurred distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> was recognized and discussed in R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992). The House of Lords reviewed the development of general principles of judicial review since Anisminic and concluded that the courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully. In his judgment, Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to O'Reilly v. Mackman (1983) and opined that [...] "the decision in [...] rendered obsolete the distinction between <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{on the face of the}} record and other <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> by extending the doctrine of ultra vires." [...] Thus, an ouster clause is ineffective when the decision-maker has acted unlawfully, whether the unlawfulness is jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional in nature. This is because [...] "Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> {{although}} {{where the}} decision-maker is an inferior court or other legally qualified adjudicative body, the error {{will probably have}} to be such that it amounts to a misconception {{of the nature of the}} function being performed or of the body's powers.|$|R
500|$|In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council, {{ex parte}} Page (1992), the House of Lords {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Anisminic had [...] "rendered obsolete the distinction between <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> {{on the face of}} the record and other <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> by extending the doctrine of ultra vires. Thenceforward it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision-making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis: a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires." [...] No case in Singapore has produced a similar opinion, but it appears that the Singapore courts adopt the same position, except perhaps where statutes contain ouster clauses.|$|R
