5|$|In practice, {{there was}} a wide number of {{variations}} to this common design. A castle could {{have more than one}} bailey: at Warkworth Castle an inner and an outer bailey was constructed, or alternatively, several baileys could flank the motte, as at Windsor Castle. Some baileys had two mottes, such as those at Lincoln. Some mottes could be square instead of round, such as at Cabal Trump. Instead of single ditches, occasionally double-ditch defences were built, as seen at Berkhamsted. Local geography and the <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> builder produced many unique designs.|$|E
5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} {{suitable}} generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> bond between contexts, as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research area <b>of</b> Formal Concept Analysis. We study different generalizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> bond within <b>the</b> L-fuzzy setting. Specifically, given a formal context there are three prototypical pairs of concept-forming operators, and this immediately leads to three possible versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> bond (so-called homogeneous bond wrt certain pair <b>of</b> concept-forming operators). <b>The</b> first results show a close correspondence between a homogeneous bond between two contexts and certain special types <b>of</b> mappings between <b>the</b> sets <b>of</b> extents (or <b>intents)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding concept lattices.

The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.|$|E

5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially at variance with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E

In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief. In 1995 the organization provided aid to Hurricane Mitch survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua. In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico.

5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated the <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead {{by members of the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E

5|$|The 1905 the Florida Legislature {{passed the}} Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into {{a school for}} white males (University of the State of Florida), a school for white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students). The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the {{character}} of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Westcott will. By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored. Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.|$|E
