40|$|Considering {{the growing}} {{concerns}} {{and importance of}} environmental issues, manufacturing industrialists, in particular those in electronics manufacturing, are seeking methods to evaluate the environmental performance of their manufacturing processes. These environmental evaluation tools should be capable of performing detailed analysis on the environmental performance of each individual process unit, identifying the environmental improvement opportunity and providing adequate decision support to environmental engineers for process modification and operational change. This paper modifies and improves the <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> model already developed and provides directions for decision-making at various stages of the analysis. The decision algorithm in this revised model adopts a hierarchical <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> <b>evaluation</b> approach and uses five impact categories related to ecological health and seven categories related to human health to form the base of an evaluation hierarchy. The algorithm, with its evaluation results presented in {{all levels of the}} hierarchy, is proposed as a means of tracking, controlling and improving the environmental performance of a process. A printed circuit board case study shows the effectiveness and applicability of the algorithm.
