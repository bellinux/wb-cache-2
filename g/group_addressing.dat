50|$|An IP {{multicast}} <b>group</b> <b>address</b> {{is used by}} {{sources and}} the receivers to send and receive multicast messages. Sources use the <b>group</b> <b>address</b> as the IP destination address in their data packets. Receivers use this <b>group</b> <b>address</b> to inform the network that {{they are interested in}} receiving packets sent to that group. For example, if some content is associated with group 239.1.1.1, the source will send data packets destined to 239.1.1.1. Receivers for that content will inform the network that they are interested in receiving data packets sent to the group 239.1.1.1. The receiver joins 239.1.1.1. The protocol typically used by receivers to join a group is called the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).|$|R

50|$|Communication {{can happen}} {{right after the}} association. Direct {{addressing}} uses both radio address and endpoint identifier, whereas indirect addressing uses every relevant field (address, endpoint, cluster, and attribute) and requires that they are sent to the network coordinator, which maintains associations and translates requests for communication. Indirect addressing is particularly useful to keep some devices very simple and minimize their need for storage.

50|$|<b>Group</b> <b>address</b> {{and unknown}} {{destination}} individual frames are optimally transmitted to only {{members of the}} same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating logical ports of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These <b>group</b> <b>address</b> packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant <b>group</b> <b>address</b> this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are {{members of the same}} service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group.

50|$|GeoTrEn spearheads two {{important}} areas in civil engineering; namely; geotechnical engineering, and transportation engineering. For bachelor's degree programmes, {{there are seven}} (7) courses offered as well as courses from other centers, such as Engineering Geology, Engineering Survey, Geotechnical Laboratory, Soil Mechanics, Geotechniques, GIS for Engineers, Highway and Traffic Engineering. There are four (4) courses offered as an elective course, namely Foundation Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Urban Traffic Management and Pavement Engineering. These courses are designed to provide good engineering practice to young graduates in the related fields. In addition, two master's degree programmes (by coursework) are offered under this center, which are M.Sc in Geotechiques and M.Sc in Highway Engineering, emphasize given to the specialized courses in the respective field. Besides, postgraduate research programmes (M.Sc and PhD) are also offered in specific areas such as advanced saturated and unsaturated soil mechanics, numerical modeling, soil stabilization, tropical rock engineering, site investigation and geophysics. While for transportation engineering the interest fields include pavement engineering, traffic, road safety engineering and urban transportation. Based on the expertise of the lecturers at the center, three research centers have been established under the Institute for Infrastructures Engineering and Sustainable Management (IIESM) namely myGERMeG, GeoFORENSIC and TRANSIT. Under myGERMeG research center, the members are actively involved in research, consultation and act as expert advisory <b>group</b> <b>addressing</b> geotechnical design and development {{in the areas of}} tropical rock engineering, soil and rock testing, and soft soil stabilization. Meanwhile, members of GeoFORENSIC research center address geotechnical problems related to tropical climate, especially on residual soil and soft marine clays i.e. landslide, soil erosion, ground settlement of highways and construction embankments on marine clay, karstic limestone and sinkholes, collapse of excavation during deep constructions and tunneling. TRANSIT research center focuses on transportation systems, infrastructure and intelligent transport which involve planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation of transportation facilities and infrastructure. As one of the center of studies in the Faculty of Civil Engineering UiTM, it is equipped with the best laboratory facilities and latest equipment/software for the purpose of teaching and learning, research, consultancy and staff/student development.|$|E
50|$|She {{married in}} 1957 {{and had a}} daughter, born in 1959. Her first public talks for the {{religion}} began by 1960. By 1962 her continued discomfort with the trend of Hollywood movies according to {{her point of view}} continued her seeking to be of greater service than being a celebrity that could bring attention to causes. Janti was known as many diverse ethnic roles though she was Polish and could speak Spanish but the roles had dubious cultural and sexist stereotypes. She was drifting away from her acting career and began to work on several advocacy/service projects while continuing to work in the arts. About 1962-3 she was a chair of Human Relations Committee of Culver City and was giving talks on race unity. She also worked on Project People which she co-hosted with Tom Bradley around 1963-4 (before he became mayor of Los Angeles) on KCOP-TV, was among the <b>group</b> <b>addressing</b> a panel of Hopi leaders at a World Peace Day observance and gave several talks as part of World Peace Day observances in Phoenix including one in Spanish. In 1964 she spoke at a Bahá'í youth conference in Pasadena as well as another talk at a Bahá'í event on race unity in Westwood. In 1965 she spoke at a Temple City Bahá'í event, and finally broke from acting completely. She spoke at a 100th anniversary observance of the Bahá'í Faith and moved to Tucson as a director of a reading institute Child Development Centers Inc. After some years of volunteering at Head Start beginning in 1965 in Watts by 1970 she took a position directing a Head Start program near Tucson Arizona for the Tohono O'odham on their Reservation. By this time Janti had also been chair of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Culver City and serving as a delegate to the national Bahá'í convention multiple times. She attempted to pioneer internationally to Ghana but a change in policy of the government ended her opportunity there before she could start. Instead she continued her talks for the religion, and took a position with Bradley's administration after 1973 by being a liaison with various coalitions and commissions, dealing with various poverty, elderly, art and youth programs and continued advocacy through Bahá'í talks for equality for women at different conferences including one highlighting the 1975 UN Women's Conference in Mexico. And she served as chair of the Los Angeles Bahá'í Spiritual Assembly while honoring the educational center Plaza de la Raza with a replica of the Aztec calendar stone.|$|E
