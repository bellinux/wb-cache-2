They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{according}} to an August 10–11 Fox News poll, 64% of Americans (a majority of each of Democrats (56–38%), Republicans (76–17%), and Independents (53–41%)) thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to build a mosque and Islamic cultural center so close to Ground Zero, and 30% felt it would be appropriate.|$|E

Each good bakery makes its bread slightly differently. Breads are made of various cereals (not just wheat or rye), whole grain breads abound and sometimes some traditional extra ingredients are used (e.g. onion, sunflower seed or lard).|$|E

60|$|He {{was forced}} {{to give up the}} duties of his office to a new pastor, and though often entreated to preach again, he would hardly ever do so, by reason, he said, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wronging</b> the souls of his people, when they had an able minister; and when he preached for the last time on a fast day, on the 63rd Psalm, it was with an apology for what he called the poorness, and meanness, and {{brokenness}} of his meditations.|$|R
25|$|Will Belton {{has never}} ceased {{to show his}} love for Clara, and she realises that he is worthy of her love. However, she {{believes}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to transfer her affection from one man to another. Only after Mrs. Askerton and Will's sister Mary Belton persuade her {{that it would be}} unjust to withhold her affection from Will can she bring herself to put aside her scruples and accept him. Marital bliss ensues.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, other singers such as Joan Baez have sung {{it during}} their tours. Cohen {{stated that he}} was duped into giving up the rights for the song, but was glad it happened, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to write a song that was so well-loved and to get rich for it also. After {{performing}} at a few folk festivals, {{he came to the}} attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond, who signed Cohen to a record deal. Cohen's first album was Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967). He appeared on BBC TV in 1968 where he sang a duet from the album with Julie Felix.|$|E
25|$|A {{party to}} a {{proceeding}} {{should have the}} right to access documentation which had been produced by the other party to the proceedings. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> if such documents were not shown to the other party at all. If a party to the proceedings needs time to study or make copies of the documents, he or she should be allowed to do so. However, as the High Court opined in Teng Cheng Sin v. Law Fay Yuen (2003), if a party does not request for copies of documents or for time to study the documents, a complaint of this nature will carry much less weight.|$|E

25|$|Foreign Minister Dick Spring, who was {{leader of}} the Labour Party, advised her not to meet Adams, whose party was linked with the Provisional IRA. However, the Government refused to {{formally}} advise her not to meet with him. She felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong,</b> {{in the absence of}} such formal advice, for her as head of state not to meet the local member of parliament during her visit, and was photographed publicly shaking his hand. During her various visits to Northern Ireland, she in fact regularly met politicians of all hues, including David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{requirements of a}} National Park are {{that it should have}} great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent. Further, the distribution of selected areas should as far as practicable be such {{that at least one of}} them is quickly accessible from each of the main centres of population in England and Wales. Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E

25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|In 617, Xiao Xi, a {{great-grandson}} of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, whom Cen Wenben's grandfather Cen Shanfang had served, rose in rebellion, {{claiming to}} restore the Liang dynasty. Xiao Xi established his capital at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and he summoned Cen Wenben to serve as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Cen {{was in charge of}} writing the imperial edicts. In 621, when the Tang dynasty general Li Xiaogong (a nephew of Emperor Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty) attacked Liang and put Jiangling under siege, Cen suggested to Xiao Xi that he surrendered, and Xiao Xi did so. After Xiao Xi's surrender, however, Li Xiaogong's subordinates wanted to pillage the city. Cen persuaded Li Xiaogong that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to do so, and Li Xiaogong subsequently ordered against pillaging. As Li Xiaogong was then put in charge of the former Liang capital, he invited Cen to serve on his staff. In 623, when Emperor Gaozu sent Li Xiaogong to attack the rebel leader Fu Gongshi, Cen followed Li Xiaogong and was in charge of his military correspondences. After Li Xiaogong defeated and killed Fu Gongshi and was put in charge of Fu's capital Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), Cen continued to serve on Li Xiaogong's staff.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.|$|E

Pytka later stated that it was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] that Harrison had not played the role, particularly after Harrison's death in 2001 and upon discovering that the ukulele was not a sample of an old song as Pytka had assumed. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas of}} the Black Consciousness Movement were not {{developed}} solely by Biko, but through lengthy discussions with other black students who were rejecting white liberalism. Biko was influenced by his reading of authors like Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X, Léopold Sédar Senghor, James Cone, and Paulo Freire. The Martinique-born Fanon, in particular, has been cited as a profound influence over Biko's ideas about liberation. Biko's biographer Xolela Mangcu cautioned that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to reduce Biko's thought to an interpretation of Fanon, and {{that the impact of}} [...] "the political and intellectual history of the Eastern Cape" [...] had to be appreciated too. Additional influences on Black Consciousness were the United States-based Black Power movement, and forms of Christianity like the activist-oriented black theology.|$|E

500|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute. Waters said [...] "it {{is hard to}} overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s" [...] and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing [...] "was the sound that knitted it all together", comparing his [...] "quiet one" [...] status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him [...] "my musical partner and my friend", praised {{the ability of the}} two men's voices to blend, such as on [...] "Echoes".

500|$|In 1985, Reagan {{visited a}} German {{military}} cemetery in Bitburg {{to lay a}} wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the Waffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves [...] "victims," [...] a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust; Pat Buchanan, Reagan's Director of Communications, argued {{that the president did}} not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust, but as victims of the ideology of Nazism. Now strongly urged to cancel the visit, the president responded that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> to back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.
