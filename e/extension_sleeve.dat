[...] Molded and continuous strip grommets, {{also known as}} edge grommets, are manufactured {{in a wide variety}} of sizes and lengths expressly for this purpose; they are usually a single piece which can be inserted by hand. Two-piece hard plastic devices are available which also grip the wire that passes through. These are called strain relief bushings and are often used to insulate, anchor, and protect power cords where they enter panels. Preventing a tug or twist on the wire from stressing the electrical connections inside the connected equipment. Sleeved grommets have a flexible <b>extension</b> (<b>sleeve),</b> usually tapered or moulded to flex increasingly towards the free end in order to reduce fracturing of electrical insulation.|$|E

Men's yukata are distinguished by the shorter <b>sleeve</b> <b>extension</b> of approximately 10 cm from the armpit seam, compared to the longer 20 cm <b>sleeve</b> <b>extension</b> in women's yukata. A standard yukata ensemble consists of a cotton undergarment (juban), yukata, obi, bare feet, sandals (geta), a foldable or fixed hand fan, and a carry bag (kinchaku). Kinchaku are used by {{both men and women}} to carry cellphones and other small personal items. For men, an optional hat may also be worn to protect the head from the sun. Yukata literally means bath(ing) clothes, although their use is not limited to after-bath wear. Yukata are a common sight in Japan during the hot summer months.Traditionally yukata were mostly made of indigo-dyed cotton but today a wide variety of colors and designs are available. As with kimono, the general rule with yukata is that younger people wear bright, vivid colors and bold patterns, while older people wear dark, matured colors and dull patterns. A child may wear a multicolored print and a young woman may wear a floral print, while an older woman would confine herself to a traditional dark blue with geometric patterns. Men in general may wear solid dark colors. Since the late 1990s, yukata have experienced increasing popularity.|$|R
5000|$|Uinyeo {{literally}} means [...] "medicine women" [...] {{and they}} usually treated gungnyeo with acupuncture and acted as midwife when the kings consort or concubine gave birth. Whenever a feast was held at court they transformed themselves into gisaeng (female entertainers). For such occasions, they wore wonsam (a female ceremonial garment), hwagwan (an elaborate coronet) on their head and colorfully striped hansam (fabric <b>extensions</b> on the <b>sleeves</b> of the costume) on their hands just like dancers, so they were also called yakbang gisaeng. Consequently, yakbang is another name for naeuiwon (royal health clinic). Although uinyeos affiliation was to the naeuiwon, their predecessors were gisaeng. The uinyeo system was originally established during King Taejongs reign because sick consorts, concubines and gungnyeo preferred to die rather than {{to be seen by}} a male doctor, due to the strict naeoebeop (sex segregation), based on Confucianism, at that time.|$|R
