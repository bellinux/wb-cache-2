5|$|Chamber {{tests and}} open water dives with two <b>divers</b> {{were made in}} 1906. The <b>divers</b> were {{successfully}} decompressed from each exposure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Divers</b> {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational <b>divers</b> usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational <b>divers</b> do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, <b>divers</b> routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
5|$|Keeping this in mind, it is {{not hard}} to see why {{technical}} <b>divers</b> who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial <b>divers</b> normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Army issues <b>diver</b> badges in four degrees (second-class <b>diver,</b> salvage <b>diver,</b> {{first-class}} <b>diver,</b> {{and master}} diver; {{if you are}} an Army engineer <b>diver)</b> and special operations <b>diver</b> badges in two degrees (<b>diver</b> and diving supervisor). [...] The second-class and first-class <b>diver</b> badges are identical to those issued by U.S. naval forces. [...] The Army does not issue officer or medical <b>diver</b> badges; however, Navy-awarded diving officer, diving medical officer, and diving medical technician badges are authorized for wear on Army uniforms with written approval from the United States Army Human Resources Command.|$|R
50|$|As the {{immediate}} in-water rescuer {{is often the}} <b>diver's</b> own buddy, recreational <b>diver</b> training agencies often teach rescue techniques in intermediate-level <b>diver</b> training courses; examples are the PADI Rescue <b>Diver,</b> the BSAC Sport <b>Diver</b> and the DIR Rebreather Rescue courses.|$|R

5|$|Recreational <b>divers</b> {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of decompression {{to the extent that the}} certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level <b>divers,</b> to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical <b>divers.</b> The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational <b>divers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recreational scuba <b>divers</b> {{commonly}} breathe nitrox containing up to 40% oxygen, while technical <b>divers</b> use pure oxygen or nitrox containing up to 80% oxygen. <b>Divers</b> who breathe oxygen fractions {{greater than}} of air (21%) {{need to be}} trained in the dangers of oxygen toxicity and how to prevent them. In order to buy nitrox, a diver has to show evidence of such qualification.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} <b>diver</b> {{training}} and certification agencies, GUE is specific about the required standard of performance for the basic skills for a new <b>diver,</b> an advanced <b>diver,</b> and an advanced technical <b>diver,</b> and specifies the equipment the <b>diver</b> should be carrying during assessment in the latter case. This allows an objective assessment of skills. The <b>diver</b> and instructor can both agree whether the skill has been performed as required, and the <b>diver</b> has a specific goal to aim for while practicing. These criteria are shared by professional <b>diver</b> training quality assurance organisations.|$|R

5000|$|Some surface {{supplied}} diving {{equipment is}} heavy and cumbersome, and the <b>diver</b> is usually assisted with dressing in by a <b>diver's</b> attendant, who is often also a <b>diver,</b> so {{the skills of}} assisting a <b>diver</b> to dress in are necessary for the <b>diver.</b> The equipment involved includes: ...|$|R
5|$|Scuba <b>divers</b> {{engaged in}} armed forces covert {{operations}} may {{be referred to}} as frogmen, combat <b>divers</b> or attack swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} <b>divers</b> may {{be supplied}} with a gas mixture suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and providing it through the umbilical to the <b>divers.</b> This allows accelerated decompression, usually on oxygen, {{which can be used}} to a maximum depth of 30ft (9m). Surface supplied heliox bounce <b>divers</b> will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of decompression techniques {{is another matter}} altogether. Recreational <b>divers</b> are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational <b>divers.</b> Technical, commercial, military and scientific <b>divers</b> may all be expected to do decompression dives in {{the normal course of}} their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these <b>divers</b> is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Two Star <b>Diver</b> - “a <b>diver</b> who {{has gained}} some open water diving {{experience}} {{and is considered}} ready {{to take part in}} dives partnered by a <b>diver</b> of at least the same or a higher grade.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of decompression equipment {{used to help}} <b>divers</b> decompress, which is the process required to allow <b>divers</b> {{to return to the}} surface safely after spending time underwater at higher pressures.|$|E
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two <b>divers</b> stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional <b>divers,</b> as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the <b>divers</b> to rest during the ascent. It also allows the <b>divers</b> to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation <b>divers</b> from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the <b>divers</b> under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew would normally start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a <b>diver</b> suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the <b>diver</b> drowning or further injury to the <b>diver</b> during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the <b>diver,</b> and suspending the <b>diver</b> from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby <b>diver</b> attend the <b>diver</b> undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|R
25|$|When underwater, a <b>diver</b> often {{needs to}} be {{neutrally}} buoyant so that the <b>diver</b> neither sinks nor rises. A state of neutral buoyancy exists when the weight of water that the <b>diver</b> displaces equals the total weight of the <b>diver.</b> The <b>diver</b> uses a BC to maintain this state of neutral buoyancy by adjusting the BC's volume and therefore its buoyancy, in response to various effects which alter the <b>diver’s</b> overall volume or weight.|$|R

5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 <b>divers</b> used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as <b>divers</b> investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the <b>divers</b> shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E

5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military <b>divers</b> to avoid detection, scientific <b>divers</b> to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media <b>divers</b> to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

50|$|Both <b>diver</b> and bellman {{monitor the}} <b>diver's</b> {{umbilical}} for excess slack. If the bellman takes up slack but the <b>diver</b> still has slack, the umbilical may be fouled, and the <b>diver</b> will generally follow the umbilical {{back towards the}} bell to clear it.|$|R
25|$|Risk {{is managed}} by {{training}} the <b>diver</b> {{in a range}} of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to the equipment the <b>diver</b> chooses to use and the environment in which the <b>diver</b> plans to dive. Further experience and development of skills by practice will increase the <b>diver's</b> ability to dive safely. Specialty training is made available by the recreational <b>diver</b> training industry and diving clubs to increase the range of environments and venues the <b>diver</b> can enjoy at an acceptable level of risk.|$|R
5|$|<b>Divers</b> {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled hyperbaric chambers {{in the water}} or at the surface, and in the extreme case, saturation <b>divers</b> are only decompressed {{at the end of}} a tour of duty that may be several weeks long.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the NSW state {{government}} announced that, {{with the approval}} of the Japanese government and the submariners' families, <b>divers</b> would be allowed to observe the M-24 wreck {{for a short period of}} time. <b>Divers</b> would enter a ballot for places on controlled dives run on several days.

5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba <b>divers</b> were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's <b>divers</b> searched with the rescue <b>divers,</b> and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the <b>divers,</b> Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff.

50|$|In a two wire {{system the}} {{standard}} arrangement for <b>diver</b> communications {{is to have}} the <b>diver's</b> side normally on, so that the surface team can hear anything from the <b>diver</b> at all times except when the surface is sending a message. In a four-wire system the <b>diver's</b> side is always on, even when the surface operator is talking.This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor the <b>diver's</b> breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the <b>diver</b> is alive. In a four wire system the <b>diver</b> to surface channel can be on all the time.|$|R
