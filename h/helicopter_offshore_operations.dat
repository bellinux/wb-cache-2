Møller–Mærsk Group, it {{operated a}} mix of scheduled and chartered passenger and cargo services. Headquartered at Dragør, its main operating bases were Copenhagen Airport, Billund Airport and Esbjerg Airport. The airline had <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations</b> from 1975 to 1999 and had three airline subsidiaries: Maersk Air UK, Maersk Commuter and Star Air.|$|R
40|$|A visual {{environment}} for maritime helicopter real-time flight simulation is presented and evaluated. For <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations,</b> simulators have {{to replicate the}} flight through obstacle scenery (e. g. radio masts, cranes, rotating wind turbine blades…), and landing on a helideck with limited visual cues due to the natural environment. Poor modeling of moving obstacles or helidecks further increases the problems the pilots are faced to, resulting in "false learning" close to moving obstacles and helidecks. The paper focuses on {{the development and implementation}} of an Offshore-Scenario, taking into account complexity, real-time ability, and realism. Based on a thorough investigation of maritime helicopter operations, an Offshore-Scenario which depicts the situation off German coast, was defined. It includes several dynamical components such as rotating wind turbine blades, wind generated waves, and moving ships and is therefore suitable for simulating common <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations.</b> The decks and visual sea models within simulators are usually not realistic, with the helideck having a sinusoidal motion and the visual wave model moving independently. Contrary to the common practice, in this work, the deck motion is modeled as a response to the wave excitation...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the wind and}} wave climate on <b>offshore</b> wind <b>operations</b> and maintenance is well known. These environmental factors dictate to a large extent whether turbine crew transfer (carried out by small vessels) or major lifting actions (carried out by large vessels) can be executed at sea. However the role of helicopter operations has received much less attention. In this paper the authors explore the helicopter access problem via statistical forecasting and implement a model innovation, by including cloud base as a key access metric. By understanding the practical limits of <b>helicopter</b> <b>operation,</b> <b>offshore</b> wind access calculations will be much improved and reflect more closely the reality of operations at sea...|$|R

5000|$|When the oil {{exploration}} in the Norwegian {{part of the}} North Sea started in 1967, {{there was a sudden}} need for helicopter transport out to the oil platforms. The first helicopter service was Helikopter Service, later renamed CHC Helikopter Service, who started operations with 2 Sikorsky S-61Ns initially from a makeshift heliport at Stavanger Airport, Forus. [...] The <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations</b> were moved to the Sola in 1989. Braathens Helikopter, a sister company of Braathens SAFE, also operated helicopters from Sola in the period 1989-1994, but was then sold to Helikopter Service. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, started their offshore flying at Sola in 1993.

5000|$|The AIBN {{also found}} {{reason to believe}} that one of the HUMS accelerometers {{installed}} in the aircraft {{would have been able to}} alert maintenance crew about the change in vibration patterns in time to avoid the accident had it been serviceable since it was configured with a setpoint value. Retrospective analysis of HUMS data showed that vibrations at the location where this accelerometer was mounted was above the setpoint value before the accident. The part of HUMS that was serviceable stored relevant information, but those data had to be retrieved by maintenance staff and analyzed between flights. At the time of the accident, usage of HUMS in <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopters</b> was in an early phase and not required by regulations. The cracks had been developing slowly for several days before the catastrophic failure occurred, and if HUMS data had been systematically retrieved and analyzed between flights the change in vibration patterns might have been discovered by maintenance staff before the fatal flight. Regulation of HUMS in <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopters</b> was one of 18 recommendations in the final AIBN report. The AIBN report and the unrealized potential of HUMS in avoiding this accident was discussed at the 2003 HUMS Conference in Melbourne and was described as [...] "a defining moment" [...] for HUMS in <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of {{offshore}} wind farms is rapidly increasing. Especially coastal European countries are building numerous offshore wind turbines in the Baltic, the North, and the Irish Sea. During both construction and operation of these wind farms, many specially-equipped helicopters are on duty. Due to their flexibility, their hover capability, and their higher speed compared to ships, these aircraft perform important tasks like helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) as well as passenger and freight transfer flights. The missions often include specific challenges like ship landings or hoist operations to drop off workers onto wind turbines. However, adverse weather conditions frequently limit <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations.</b> In such scenarios, the adoption of aircraft-mounted sensors and obstacle databases together with helmet-mounted displays (HMD) seems to offer great potential to improve the operational capabilities of the helicopters used. By displaying environmental information in a visual conformal manner, these systems mitigate the loss of visual reference to the environment. This helps the pilots to maintain proper situational awareness (SA). This paper presents how our previously introduced concept of an HMD-based virtual flight deck can enhance <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> missions. The advantages of this system – for instance its “see-through the airframe”-capability and its highly-flexible cockpit instrument setup – enable us to design entirely novel pilot assistance systems. The work analyzes the specific requirements on our virtual cockpit so as to assist the helicopter crew in offshore-specific tasks. The gained knowledge is used to propose and evaluate concepts for a virtual cockpit that is tailor-made for <b>helicopter</b> <b>offshore</b> maneuvers...|$|R

40|$|Helicopters play a {{vital role}} in the {{movement}} of people and cargo to and from the installations of the oil and gas industry at sea, often in challenging environments, such as nighttime, where accidents tend to have serious impacts. The ability to remain safe is largely reliant on the processes of hazard identification and risk analysis. However, the processes currently used do not provide the <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> industry with the desired levels of safety in nighttime operations. The reasons for this include serious methodological weaknesses in current processes, especially the lack of a holistic view of the safety-critical components of the industry; biased and over-simplistic analysis of accidents; overreliance on reported incidents of doubtful statistical utility; ad hoc survey methods to elicit opinions of pilots rather than facts about hazards; and the complete absence of predictive analysis using hazard data. This thesis addresses these weaknesses by developing and implementing a new and comprehensive methodology consisting of a number of processes used in an integrated manner, with novel contributions in taxonomy development, data quality and qualitative and quantitative data analytics to enhance hazard identification and risk analysis of nighttime <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> <b>operations.</b> The thesis demonstrates that this new methodology is effective in describing the safety-critical components of the <b>offshore</b> <b>helicopter</b> industry, identifying systematic hazards patterns and trends from the statistical analysis of accident reports, establishing the appropriate use of incident reports for hazard identification and risk analysis and exploiting knowledge and facts elicited directly from surveys of pilots to discriminate accurately the riskiest phases of flight, identify an exhaustive and statistically representative range of hazards related to the riskiest of such phases and analyse the hazard data through quantitative predictive analysis. The methodology is easily transferable to other operations in the helicopter domain by institutions of international reach (e. g., the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO) and individual helicopter operators.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has evolved for centuries. The development of the society and the rapid grow of global economy require energy as a driven force for the engine of global economy plays a significant role in providing sustainable development for the nations’ civilization. Although a diversification pattern of use of energy has established, fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas still occupy the dominant position in energy consumption. In China, over 490 million tons of oil was consumed in 2012, and this number will still increase in the future. However, with oil and gas production approaching its tail end on many onshore oilfields in China, the oil companies are seeking new opportunities towards the deep ocean to open up a new turn of exploration and production. The South China Sea, which is considered as the potential sustaining area for the future growth of the nation’s economy, contains probably billons of tons of oil and gas resources. Due to the high risk and high investment in offshore oil exploration and production, safety is considered as the primary principle in any <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> by almost all oil companies. Therefore, in order to avoid any fatalities, environmental incidents, and unnecessary stopping in <b>offshore</b> <b>operations,</b> a set of factors ranging from environmental, geographical and cultural aspects should be identified to minimize the potential risk before any operations can be undertaken. The major objective of this thesis is to identify the possible factors that may influence <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> and maintenance processes from environmental, geographical and cultural aspects.

40|$|Due {{to decline}} in oil {{resources}} {{the price of}} oil has increased during resent years, resulting in a greater need and interest in finding new oil reserves. When interest in oil exploration in new areas increases, it also means that new potential markets for <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> will be created. The Arctic is a region where a quarter of the world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves are estimated to be located, which has increased the interest in oil exploration in the Arctic. Since {{the price of oil}} {{is considered to be a}} driving factor for the interest in oil exploration in the Arctic, this report examines how the price of oil might affect <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> in the Arctic. Since the ice in the Arctic is melting faster than scientists have predicted, it is also a relevant affecting factor to investigate.

The questions that form the basis of this report is how the price of oil affect <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> in the Arctic, and how the melting ice affect <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> in the Arctic. This report is formed by a qualitative method where data collection has been conducted through literature and an interview.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation is to understand how companies develop capability to manage and implement <b>offshore</b> <b>operations.</b> Even though <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> {{is not a new}} subject – it has been practiced by companies for a long time, and is a growing operations practice employed by companies worldwide – academic efforts are still needed to achieve a full understanding of this phenomenon. One of those efforts is the comprehension of the strategic aspects of offshore. Offshore has implications for the strategic management field because it can instigate a firm to develop new capabilities and resources. In addition, companies have also moved high skill and core business activities overseas, requiring implementation of new organizational measures. For instance, literature has suggested that capabilities development is important to undertake more complex offshore processes and to overcome managerial challenges and implementation barriers. Thus, this study integrates Dynamic Capabilities as a main theory lens and <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> as organizational context. More specifically, this study takes Dynamic Capabilities as the “firm's ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments” (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997, p. 516). This concept emphasizes Dynamic Capabilities as a set of organizational processes, which result in the development of specific capabilities in order to fit with environmental conditions. This study also takes <b>offshore</b> <b>operations</b> as “the movement or relocation of domestic firm activities and operations abroad” (Bunyaratavej, Hahn, & Doh, 2008, p. 227). Thus, the study offers a twofold contribution to the field. First, it explores how companies develop capability to manage <b>offshore</b> <b>operations.</b> Second, it explores the role of three dynamic capabilities elements (paths, positions, and processes) in the development of such capabilities.
