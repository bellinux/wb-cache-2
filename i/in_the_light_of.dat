The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E

5|$|During the Interregnum, Portland Castle {{continued}} to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing action in a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{grouping}} of railway companies in 1923, the LSWR {{became part of}} the Southern Railway (SR) and its publicity department gave the N15locomotives names associated with Arthurian legend; the class hence becoming known as King Arthurs. The Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the newly formed company, Richard Maunsell, modified the Urie locomotives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> operational experience and increased the class strength to 74 locomotives. Maunsell and his Chief Draughtsman James Clayton incorporated several improvements, notably to the steam circuit and valve gear.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E

During this period, Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens' naval power. The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended, and Themistocles's naval policies may be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the potential threat from Persia.
