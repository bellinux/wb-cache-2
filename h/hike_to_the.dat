25|$|After taking over, the FFGC spent $38 ($ {{in modern}} dollars) {{repairing}} the tower. The state also added a dedicated telephone line along a truck road it built connecting to Mill Brook Road {{at the north}} so the observers stationed at the tower {{would not have to}} <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tower from the club's very remote location {{at the end of a}} long road up an isolated river valley. In its first year, according to the commission's annual report, observers spotted fires as far away as Fallsburg and Liberty in Sullivan County and in the Shawangunks, far to the south and southeast.|$|E

Removal of artifacts are strictly forbidden.|$|E
25|$|Slemish Mountain is open year-round, and on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March), {{large crowds}} <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} {{mountain}} as a pilgrimage. The 1.5-kilometre round walk to the summit and back takes approximately one hour in good weather. Excellent views can be had of the Antrim and Scottish coasts to the East. Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains are all normally visible to the West whilst the Bann Valley and the higher summits of the Antrim Hills can be seen to the North. The 180-metre climb is steep and rocky. The path can become very slippery in wet weather so tourists are advised to take care.|$|E

500|$|Dragon Challenge was {{a roller}} coaster {{featuring}} two distinct tracks built to overlap and intertwine with each other. The ride was formerly in operation since the park's 1999 opening under the name Dueling Dragons. The physical coaster is exactly the same, with some new decor. The attraction was renamed in homage to the first task of the Triwizard Tournament where Harry and the other contestants are each to duel with a dragon, depicted in chapter 20 of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The {{two sides of the}} coaster have been renamed [...] "Hungarian Horntail" [...] and [...] "Chinese Fireball", after two of the dragon breeds which appear in the book. It was the only chasing inverted roller coaster in the world. The queue for this ride features many Harry Potter relics, including the Goblet of Fire and the Triwizard Cup. In addition, the <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ride features the flying car featured in the second film, as well as Hagrid's hut. On July 24, 2017, Universal Orlando officials announced that Dragon Challenge would close after September 4, 2017 {{to make way for a}} new attraction based on the Harry Potter franchise that is scheduled to open in 2019.|$|E

2500|$|Persons at {{the scene}} said that the plane had crashed {{on the north side}} of the {{mountain}} about [...] from the top.

In the final 13th leg of this race, the three remaining teams took taxicabs from the Calgary International Airport to Banff’s Sunshine Village.

2500|$|The Goodspeed/Nattkemper Trail, which {{climbs to}} the summit from the Adobe Canyon Road trailhead, offers the most direct access {{to the summit}} and to Gunsight Rock, from which distant views to the south and west are available. From the Los Alamos Road trailhead, the Hood Mountain Trail descends to and crosses Santa Rosa Creek, then climbs via an easily walked fireroad to the summit, passing through the pygmy forest on the {{northwest}} side of the mountain. [...] The Summit Trail branches from the Hood Mountain Trail at about 1,400 feet (427 m) elevation and offers a more rugged <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit.

2500|$|Condell barely {{survived a}} serious {{political}} challenge to his presidency in 1989. [...] PEF {{spent much of}} the year fighting layoffs. [...] Convinced that PEF would be fighting layoffs the following year as well, Condell proposed raising dues 26.6 percent ($5.28 a month) to build a public relations and legal war chest. But PEF leaders balked at submitting the dues increase to the membership. PEF's 127-member executive board refused to recommend Condell's dues <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membership, but agreed to submit the plan to a vote anyway. The leadership of PEF's Capitol District (its largest region) floated their own plan for a dues increase at a much lower level, and observers concluded that if Condell lost the dues vote at the upcoming PEF convention in October he would probably not be able to win re-election in 1991. PEF members did indeed reject Condell's proposal for a dues increase (twice), but also refused to approval six other plans for a dues increase offered by leaders of the Capitol District as well as others. After extensive parliamentary maneuvering (which some PEF members claimed was illegal), Condell was able to win approval of his original dues proposal.|$|E

2500|$|McCandless {{survived for}} {{approximately}} 113 {{days in the}} Alaskan wilderness, foraging for edible roots and berries, shooting an assortment of game—including a moose—and keeping a journal. Although he planned to <b>hike</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast, the boggy terrain of summer proved too difficult, and he decided instead to camp in a derelict bus. In July, he tried to leave, {{only to find the}} route blocked by a snow-melt swollen river. On July 30, McCandless wrote a journal entry which reads, EXTREMELY WEAK. FAULT OF POT SEED Based on this entry, Krakauer hypothesized that McCandless had been eating what he thought was [...] the roots of an edible plant, Hedysarum alpinum, commonly known as wild Eskimo potato, which are sweet and nourishing in the spring but later become too tough to eat. When this happened, McCandless may have attempted to eat the seeds instead. Krakauer first speculated that the seeds were actually from Hedysarum mackenzii, or wild sweet pea, instead of the Eskimo Potato, which contained a poisonous alkaloid, possibly swainsonine (the toxic chemical in locoweed) or something similar. In addition to neurological symptoms, such as weakness and loss of coordination, the poison causes starvation by blocking nutrient metabolism in the body. However, Krakauer later suggested that McCandless had not confused the two plants and had in fact actually eaten Hedysarum alpinum. Krakauer had the plant tested for any toxins and, through tests on Hendysarum alpinum, it was discovered that it contained an unidentifiable form of toxin.|$|E
2500|$|The forest {{includes}} Puerto Rico's highest peak, Cerro de Punta, {{which is}} located at km. 17.0 on Puerto Rico Highway 143. It is at 18.1722°N, 66.5917°W (...)

[...] There is parking on PR-143 for those who prefer {{to walk to the}} hilltop.
