We present an automated algebraic proof that making two knots leads to a regular heptagon.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the basic <b>fold</b> <b>operations,</b> {{often referred to}} as Huzita’s axioms, which represent the standard seven operations used commonly in computational origami. We reformulate the operations by giving them precise conditions that eliminate the degenerate and inci-dent cases. We prove that the reformulated ones yield a finite number of fold lines. Furthermore, we show how the incident cases reduce certain operations to simpler ones. We present an alternative single operation based on one of the operations without side conditions. We show how each of the reformulated operations can be realized by the alternative one. It is known that cubic equations can be solved using origami fold-ing. We study the extension of origami by introducing <b>fold</b> <b>operations</b> that involve conic sections.

40|$|Abstract—Polar coding {{is known}} as the first provably capacity-achieving coding scheme under low-complexity {{suboptimal}} suc-cessive cancelation decoding (SCD). The large error-correction capability of finite-length polar codes is mostly achieved with relatively long codes. SCD is the conventional decoder for polar codes and exhibits a quasi-linear complexity in terms of the code length. Practical decoder schemes with low latency are important for high-speed polar coding applications. In this letter, we propose a nonbinary multiple folded SCD scheme to reduce the decoding latency of standard binary polar codes. Multiple foldings were first proposed to improve the efficiency of folded tree maximum-likelihood decoder for Kronecker product-based codes. By suc-cessively applying the <b>folding</b> <b>operation</b> κ times on the SCD, for a code length N, the latency is reduced from 2 N − 1 to (N/ 2 κ− 1) − 1 time slots, assuming full parallelization. We show that multiple folded SCD can be effectively implemented for up to κ = 3 foldings due to memory limitations. This decoder achieves exactly the same performance of the original SCD with signifi-cantly reduced latency. Index Terms—Polar codes, SC decoder, <b>folding</b> <b>operation.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a dual-image based scheme in {{information}} sharing consists of concealing secret messages in two cover images; only someone who has both stego-images can extract the secret messages. In 2015, Lu et al. proposed a center-folding strategy where each secret symbol is folded into the reduced digit to reduce the distortion of the stego-image. Then, in 2016, Lu et al. used a frequency-based encoding strategy to reduce the distortion of the frequency of occurrence of the maximum absolute value. Because the folding strategy can obviously reduce the value, the proposed scheme includes the <b>folding</b> <b>operation</b> twice to further decrease the reduced digit. We use a frequency-based encoding strategy to encode a secret message and then use the block folding technique by performing the center-folding operation twice to embed secret messages. An indicator is needed to identify the sequence number of the <b>folding</b> <b>operation.</b> The proposed scheme collects several indicators to produce a combined code and hides the code in a pixel {{to reduce the size}} of the indicators. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher image quality under the same embedding rate or higher payload, which is better than other methods...|$|E

40|$|Event {{structures}} represent {{concurrent processes}} {{in terms of}} events and dependencies between events modelling behavioural relations like causality and conflict. Since the introduction of prime event structures, many variants of event structures have been proposed with different behavioural relations and, hence, with differences in their expressive power. One of the possible benefits of using a more expressive event structure is that of having a more compact representation for the same behaviour when considering the number of events used in a prime event structure. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of reducing {{the size of an}} event structure while preserving behaviour under a well-known notion of equivalence, namely history preserving bisimulation. In particular, we investigate this problem on two generalisations of the prime event structures. The first one, known as asymmetric event structure, relies on a asymmetric form of the conflict relation. The second one, known as flow event structure, supports a form of disjunctive causality. More specifically, we describe the conditions under which a set of events in an event structure can be folded into a single event while preserving the original behaviour. The successive application of this <b>folding</b> <b>operation</b> leads to a minimal size event structure. However, the order on which the <b>folding</b> <b>operation</b> is applied may lead to different minimal size event structures. The latter has a negative implication on the potential use of a minimal size event structure as a canonical representation for behaviour. Comment: 23 page...|$|E
