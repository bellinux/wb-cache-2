60|$|The most {{successful}} {{of these small}} speculations is that of Mr. E. Hollway. Assisted by an able gardener from Saint Michael, Azores, where the pineapple made a little fortune for Ponta Delgada, he has converted Mount Pleasant, his father's house and grounds on the Caminho do Meio, into one huge pinery. The Madeiran sun does all the work of English fires and flues; but the glass must be whitewashed; otherwise, being badly made, with bubbles and flaws, it would burn holes in the plants. The best temperature for the hot-houses is about 90° F.: it will rise after midday to 140°, and fall at night to 65°. The species preferred are, in order of merit, the Cayena, the black Jamaica, and the Brazilian Abacaxi. The largest of Mr. Hollway's produce weighed 20 lbs.--pumpkin size. Those of 12 lbs. and 15 lbs. are common, but the market prefers 8 lbs. His highest price was 2l., and he easily obtains from 10s. to 15s. In one greenhouse we saw 2,500 plants potted and bedded; the total numbers more than double that figure. The proprietor has a steam-saw, makes his own boxes, and packs his pines with dry leaves of maize and plantain. He is also cultivating a <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana,</b> too short to be wind-wrung. His ground will grow anything: the wild asparagus, which in Istria rises knee-high, here becomes a tall woody shrub.|$|E

40|$|Anthracnose {{is one of}} {{the main}} post-harvest disease of the banana, caused by {{different}} physiological races of Colletotrichum musae. It manifests itself mostly in ripe fruits, threatening its quality. Its appearance is related to the inadequate handling, absence of chemical control in field, and cooling. Application of chemical products is usually done during the processing, but it is important to point out that it can be done while the fruit is still in the field. This work had as an objective to verify the effect post-harvest application of fungicides to control anthracnose in <b>Dwarf</b> Silver <b>bananas,</b> stored at 20 °C and 12 °C. To that end, the influence of the thiabendazole and imazalil fungicides was tested on Colletotrichum musae. In the tests we employed Dwarfed Silver isolates of cultivars FHIA 02 and ST 4208 inoculated in <b>Dwarfed</b> Silver <b>bananas.</b> The evaluations were done every 3 days, by measuring the size of injuries (mm 2). The inoculated fruits were discarded in the stage 7 of maturation (yellow with brown tips). The most efficient treatments in disease control were those in which the bananas were treated with the thiabendazole fungicide.

50|$|Ensete lasiocarpum, {{commonly}} known as Chinese <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana,</b> golden lotus banana or Chinese yellow banana, is a plant of the Ensete genus. It is thus a close relative of bananas, and {{also a member of}} the Musaceae family. The plant is native to the Yunnan province in China, where it grows high in the mountains up to an altitude of 2500 m. It is known for its yellow erect flower (see image), generally appearing during the second year of cultivation, that can last a few months. Just before opening, the flower resembles a lotus - from which the plant gets one of its names.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDietary {{products}} {{are among the}} therapeutic approaches used to modify intestinal microflora and to promote protective effects during the intestinal inflammatory process. Because the banana plant is rich in resistant starch, which is used by colonic microbiota for the anaerobic production of the short-chain fatty acids that serve as a major fuel source for colonocytes: first, green <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana</b> flour produces protective effects on the intestinal inflammation acting as a prebiotic and, second, combination of this dietary supplementation with prednisolone presents synergistic effects. For this, we used the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis. Our results revealed that the protective effect produced {{by a combination of}} 10 % green <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana</b> flour with prednisolone was more pronounced than those promoted by a single administration of prednisolone or a diet containing 10 % or 20 % banana flour. This beneficial effect was associated with an improvement in the colonic oxidative status because the banana flour diet prevented the glutathione depletion and inhibited myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation. In addition, the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity was associated with an inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity, a reduction in macroscopic and microscopic scores, and an extension of the lesions. In conclusion, the dietary use of the green <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana</b> flour constitutes an important dietary supplement and complementary medicine product to prevention and treatment of human inflammatory bowel disease...|$|E

We studied the in vitro growth of Cattleya bicolor Lindl. grown in a simplified culture medium supplemented with different kinds of fruit pulp. The experimental design was completely randomised, with eight seedlings per replication and ten replications per treatment, {{for a total of}} 80 seedlings per treatment. The culture medium was made using 150 g L - 1 of pulp (without peel or seed) from the following fruits: ripe Santa Cruz tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.), <b>dwarf</b> <b>bananas</b> (Musa cavendishii L.) of intermediate ripeness, light green chayote (Sechium edule (Jacq.)

The treatments and the control were kept in a growth chamber for seven months before evaluating seedling survival percentage, shoot height, number of leaves, rooting percentage, root number, root length and dry masses of shoot and roots. The highest percentages of seedling survival were obtained using MS 50 %, banana and coconut medium. The seedling survival and rooting percentages illustrate {{that it is possible to}} emphasise the culture medium MS 50 % and the culture medium supplemented with coconut on the most traditional culture medium with banana or tomato pulp.

40|$|A {{three factors}} {{quadratic}} regression rotation combination design was adopted {{to optimize the}} technical conditions of microwave low temperature carbon dioxide flash puffing (MLTCDFP) process for <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana</b> in the single factor’s foundation. This paper analyzed the effect of puffing temperature, puffing pressure, vacuum drying temperature and {{the interaction of the}} three factors on color, crispness, and the effect of hardness and water content. Based on the experimental data, the quadratic regression model of four indexes was deduced, then variables were analyzed with response surface methodology (RSM). The weights of four evaluation indexes was determined by factor analysis. The regression square was obtained by the comprehensive score as follow: Y= 0. 955 + 0. 109 X 1 + 0. 16 X 3 − 0. 09 X 12 + 0. 015 X 22 − 0. 15 X 32 − 0. 018 X 1 X 2 − 0. 056 X 1 X 3 + 0. 016 X 2 X 3 (R 2 = 0. 837).

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{inhibitory}} effects of batangas mandarin skin and <b>dwarf</b> <b>banana</b> peel on Microcystis aeruginosa. In laboratory assays, algal growth was significantly inhibited {{by the addition}} of mandarin skin extract (0. 1 % w/v). When the concentration of mandarin skin increased to 0. 5 % (w/v), no algal growth was detected, whereas in the presence of banana peel extract (0. 5 %, w/v) the algal biomass was only slightly suppressed. The results show that mandarin skin has higher anti-algal activity than banana peel. Fresh unprocessed mandarin skin and banana peel showed very effective anti-algal activity. Pre-treatment was not required for their anti-algal activity. It is possible that mandarin skin and banana peel might be effective material to control harmful algal blooms...|$|E

This was halted after considerable national protest, but logging still occurs around the fringes and between S. Kinchin and S. Kemapan.

40|$|Banana is eaten {{all over}} the world by all {{sections}} of the population. It is known to contain potassium and {{it has been suggested that}} it could serve as a source of potassium. Recently, a valuable chemical component, a lectin, called BanLec, was isolated from banana fruit and found to possess anti-HIV- 1 activity. However, the peels of banana are thrown away as rubbish and farmers are known to use them as feed for their animals. It is therefore necessary to determine the potassium content of some Nigerian bananas and to also extract the oils from their peels. The components of the extracted oils are to be determined and tested for their biological activity. The potassium content of five (5) varieties of Nigerian <b>bananas</b> (<b>Dwarf</b> Cavendish AAA GP; Lady Finger AA GP; Dwarf Chinese Double; Double Dwarf Senorata AA GP; Giant Cavendish (Williams) AAA GP and Dwarf Red AAA GP) was determined using flame photometer. The potassium content varied from 0. 15 mg/g (Dwarf Red) to 1. 80 mg/g (Lady Finger). Compared to the value of 358 mg per 100 g reported in the literature, these values are very low and considerable lower than the RDA of 4700 mg. The conclusion is that Nigerian bananas will not be a viable source of potassium for candidates with potassium deficiency. A report on the methanolic extract of oil from their peels is given. Two (2) of the five (5) varieties were chosen and methanolic extraction of oils from their peels was undertaken. The crude extract was subjected to phytochemical analysis, which revealed the presence of the following of steroids, saponin and terpenoids, anthraquinones and tannins. A report is also given on antimicrobial studies of the methanolic extracts, which revealed that the oils were effective against some bacteria...|$|R

Os bananais foram divididos em três níveis de produtividade: baixa produtividade (32 t ha- 1 ano- 1). Em cada bananal selecionado, foram coletadas amostras de solo e realizadas análises químicas e físicas. Amostras de folhas de cada bananal foram coletadas em 20 plantas. Nas amostras foliares, foram determinados os teores de N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn e Zn. Verificou-se que os teores de Ca, K, P, matéria orgânico, os valores de condutividade elétrica, CTC, a porcentagem de saturação por bases (V%) e as quantidades de argila e silte apresentaram-se significativamente maiores nos solos dos bananais com alta produtividade. Nos solos dos bananais com alta produtividade, as quantidades de Ca, K e Mg corresponderam a 82 %, 5 % e 13 % da saturação por bases, respectivamente.
