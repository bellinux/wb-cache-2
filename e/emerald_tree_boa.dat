50|$|One of London Zoo's most {{well-known}} buildings, the Reptile House opened in 1927 and {{was designed by}} Joan Beauchamp Procter and Sir Edward Guy Dawber. It houses several species of reptile, including Jamaican boa, Philippine crocodiles, eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, black mambas, rhinoceros iguanas, king cobras, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas</b> and Yemen chameleons. In December 2012, a refurbished amphibian section was opened to the public, displaying amphibians such as African bullfrogs, axolotls, caecillians and various types of poison dart frog.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tissues were {{evaluated}} from <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> Corallus caninus, from a collection in which chlamydiosis was diagnosed. To determine {{the strain of}} chlamydia infecting these snakes, tissue samples from 5 frozen snakes were tested by a quantitative TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and a PCR sequence analysis test. Of the 22 samples tested, 9 were categorized as either positive or weakly positive with the TaqMan test, and 6 yielded an amplicon using a serial PCR test that amplified {{a portion of the}} 23 S ribosomal RNA gene. A PCR product suitable for sequencing was obtained from the heart of one of the snakes. Sequence analysis showed that the snake had been infected with Chlamydophila pneumoniae. These findings show that C. pneumoniae can infect <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> broadening the range of reptiles known to be infected by this primarily human pathogen. Chlamydiois has been reported in several species of rep-tiles, including puff adders (Bitis arietans), 4 a flap-necked chameleon (Chameleo dilepis), 5 green turtles (Chelonia my-das), 7 Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), 8 green iguanas (Iguana iguana), 1 and Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus). 1 Lesions varied and included histiocytic granu...|$|R

It opened in 2014 and houses the uakari, southern black howler monkey, red-bellied piranha, keel-billed toucan, harpy eagle, Goliath bird-eating spider, giant river otter, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> cotton-top tamarin, Baird's tapir, jaguar and other species.|$|E
5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top tamarins, meerkats, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, {{a part of the}} larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.|$|R
5000|$|The Tropical Realm is {{also the}} centre of the reptile collection. The {{crocodile}} pools (which formerly housed West African dwarf crocodiles, American alligators and Philippine crocodiles) currently house spectacled caimans in one and white-winged wood ducks in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for tuataras. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving sphenodont, a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) rhinoceros ratsnakes, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas</b> and eyelash vipers now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of Serrated Casquehead Iguanas, Green-Crested Lizards, caiman lizards, and a Parson's chameleon.|$|R
50|$|South America {{had been}} isolated, an island continent, for many {{millions}} of years, {{and it had a}} wide range of fauna found nowhere else, though many of them became extinct during the Great American Interchange about 3 million years ago, such as the Saparassodonta family. Those that survived the interchange included the ground sloths, glyptodonts, pampatheres, phorusrhacids and notoungulates; all managed to extend their range to North America. In the Pleistocene, South America remained largely unglaciated except for increased mountain glaciation in the Andes, with the megafauna were marginally affected. At the start of the Holocene, all the preeminent genera of megafauna became extinct. Their smaller relatives remain, including anteaters, tree sloths, armadillos; New World marsupials: opossums, shrew opossums, and the monito del monte (actually more related to Australian marsupials). Today the largest land mammals remaining in South America are the wild camels of the Lamini group, such as the guanacos and vicu√±as, and the Tapirus genus, of which Baird's tapir can reach up to 400 kg. Other notable surviving large fauna are peccaries, marsh deer (Capreolinae), spectacled bears, maned wolves, pumas, ocelots, jaguars, rheas, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> boa constrictors, anacondas, american crocodiles, caimans, and giant rodents such as capybaras.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{include the}} yellow-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis denticulata), green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis species).The Caqueta moist forests {{are known for}} snakes such as <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Corallus caninus), fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm vipers (Bothriechis species), common green racer (Philodryas viridissima), coral snakes (Micrurus species), boa constrictors (Boa constrictor) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta).|$|E

50|$|Early 2013 saw {{the opening}} of a new meerkat {{enclosure}} alongside the currently under construction reptile and small mammal building. In late March 2013, a new jungle gym for children to play in was built next door the safari skyride, replacing an exhibit that once held Indian muntjacs, Stanley cranes, and African spurred tortoises. The Indian muntjacs have been moved to a non-public area, the Stanley cranes had moved to the Safari Ride and the African spurred tortoises had moved near the orangutan island. In mid-April 2013, a Baird's tapir and a Ruppell's griffon vulture were added to the zoo, and can be seen in a safari-ride preserve area. A capybara was added to the South America yard in late April 2013. In 2015 phase 1 of the Reptile Building opened to the public to view various reptiles and amphibians, including the Komodo dragon. In August 2016, a new serval exhibit opened adjacent to the bat exhibit. The zoo will have new animals include pygmy hippos and giant anteaters on Summer 2017. On June 26, the reptile house was expanded with a new hallway containing 13 additional exhibits for 15 new species including rhino iguanas, rhino rat snakes, Madagascar <b>tree</b> <b>boas,</b> prehensile-tailed skinks, Dominican mountain boas, veiled chameleons, and <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boas.</b> Later this year, the African clawless otters will move to a new home near the playground, and two new primate islands similar to the existing ones holding chimpanzees and orangutans will be made to be viewed from the Safari Train Ride.|$|R

50|$|Sanzinia madagascariensis (also {{known as}} the Malagasy <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> or Madagascar <b>tree</b> <b>boa)</b> is a non-venomous boa species endemic to the island of Madagascar. Two {{subspecies}} are currently recognized: S. m. madagascariensis and S. m. volontany.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{species are}} {{frequently}} imported as display animals, the Amazon tree boa, C. hortulanus, and the <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> C. caninus. [...] "Pet" [...] {{is not a}} term one would apply to these species, as most, if not all, have an aggressive demeanor and will strike readily. Their stunning coloration makes them popular, but their specialized habitat and feeding make them suitable only for advanced keepers.|$|E
50|$|Primarily arboreal, these snakes have a {{particular}} way of resting in the branches of trees; they loop a coil or two over the branches in a saddle position and place their head in the middle. This trait is shared with the <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Corallus caninus) of South America. This habit, along with their appearance, has caused people to confuse the two species when seen outside their natural habitat.|$|E
50|$|Reptiles include Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa), {{spectacled caiman}} (Caiman crocodilus), green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis genus). Snakes include green {{anaconda}} (Eunectes murinus), lanceheads (Bothrops atrox), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis genus), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Corallus caninus), and bushmaster (Lachesis muta). Fish include silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), tetras (Hyphessobrycon and Bryconops genera), piranhas (Serrasalmus genus) and ocellate river stingray (Potamotrygon motoro).Endangered amphibians include Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni).|$|E

50|$|All {{members of}} this genus are long, {{slightly}} flattened laterally and have thin bodies with large heads. They typically have relatively large eyes, although this is less pronounced in the larger species, such as the <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> Corallus caninus. The anterior teeth are highly elongated, often being several times the length one would expect for snakes of their size. These are used for penetrating layers of feathers to get {{a firm grip on}} birds, their primary prey. All members of the genus are nocturnal and have large numbers of very pronounced thermoreceptive pits are located between the labial scales.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} small mammals, such as rodents, and sometimes reptiles, such as geckos and skinks. This snake, like the <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa,</b> {{was thought to}} eat birds; however, Switak conducted field work on this issue. In examining stomach contents of more than 1,000 animals, he {{did not find any}} evidence of avian prey. Prey is captured by holding onto a branch using the prehensile tail and striking out from an s-shaped position and constricting the prey. Wild specimens have also been observed and photographed wrapped around the base of small tree trunks, facing down in an ambush position, presumably waiting for ground mammals to prey upon.|$|E
50|$|The reserve has typical {{amphibians}} of the Amazon rainforest {{including the}} South American common toad (Rhinella margaritifera), the gladiator frog Hyla wavrini and the Manaus slender-legged tree frog (Osteocephalus taurinus).The frogs Dendropsophus melanargyreus and Pseudopaludicola mystacalis, {{more common in}} the cerrado, are also found.Reptiles include typical Amazon species such as the gecko Gonatodes eladioi, the lizards Bachia flavescens and Anolis punctatus, false coral snake (Anilius scytale), pit viper Bothriopsis taeniata, <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> <b>boa</b> (Corallus caninus) and Xenoxybelis argenteus.Regionally endemic species include five species of frog including rhinella castaneotica, Brazil-nut poison frog (Adelphobates castaneoticus) and Hyla anataliasiasi. two caecilians (Nectocaecilia ladigesi and typhlonectes obesus and seven lizards including Arthrosaura kockii, striped forest whiptail (Kentropyx calcarata) and Leposoma guianense.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> monitor (Varanus prasinus) {{or green}} tree monitor, {{is a small}} to {{medium-sized}} arboreal monitor lizard. It {{is known for its}} unusual coloration, which consists of shades from green to turquoise, topped with dark, [...] banding. This coloration helps camouflage it in its arboreal habitat. Its colour also makes the <b>emerald</b> <b>tree</b> monitor highly exploited to the pet trade and kept in zoos alike.|$|R
