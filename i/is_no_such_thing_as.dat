5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a collective clan crest, just as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a clan coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E

25|$|In Wicca, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> hell because Wiccans largely do {{not believe}} in the concept of {{punishment}} or reward. Although Wiccan views differ among different denominations, Wiccans tend to prefer viewing the Horned God and the Goddess as gentle deities.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term postmodern there are critics of its application. Kirk Varnedoe, for instance, stated that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> postmodernism, and that the {{possibilities}} of modernism {{have not yet been}} exhausted. These critics are currently in the minority.|$|E
25|$|John Lukacs, Hungarian-American {{historian}} and Holocaust survivor, argues that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> generic fascism.

25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E

25|$|The popular {{mind was}} taken with Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. This was {{accompanied}} by other feminist philosophers, such as Alicia Ostriker and Adrienne Rich. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what {{they believe to be}} masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E

25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
25|$|Resilience in {{children}} refers {{to individuals who}} are doing better than expected, given a history that includes risk or adverse experience. Once again, {{it is not a}} trait or something that some children simply possess. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> an 'invulnerable child' that can overcome any obstacle or adversity that he or she encounters in life—and in fact, the trait is quite common. Resilience {{is the product of a}} large number of developmental processes over time, that has allowed children who experience some sort of risk to continue to develop competently (while other children do not).|$|E
25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy {{a series of questions}} about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E
