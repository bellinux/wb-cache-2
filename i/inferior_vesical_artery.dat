30|$|Chronic {{bleeding}} {{has been}} described in cases of most significant problems of oncourology. Oncologic patient can face a permanent cascade of disbalance between pathways of coagulation (Fricke et al., 2017; Salignac et al., 2002; Kennedy et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016). These patientsare in slightly greater risk of bleeding without any surgical procedure and greater risk of bleeding in post-operative period. The {{most common cause of}} such complication could be a diffuse bleeding from traumatized tumor tissue surface after cystoscopic punch-biopsy. Conservative methods of bleeding control (Kolev & Longstaff, 2016) (fibrinolysis inhibitors) will be ineffective in most cases. It’s a complex situation, because not each all patient from this cohort can survive cystostomy due to poor performance status. Recently, superselective embolization became the method of choice to control such bleeding. Besides, physicians choose embolization among other methods of treatment for acute bleeding: combined trauma with pelvic fractures, uncontrollable bleedings after gynecological surgical operations and complications of radiotherapy (may be chronic as well) (Agolini et al., 1997; Matityahu et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2014; Sieber, 1994; Samuel Washington & Benjamin, 2016; El-Shalakany, 2003). Usually, sequence of actions comprises bilateral diagnostic angiography of internal iliac arteries in order to determine a source of bleeding (arterial supply of bladder tumors can originate from superior and/or <b>inferior</b> <b>vesical</b> <b>arteries,</b> prostatic arteries, not infrequently it may be branches of internal pudendal artery, obturator arteries (Vikash Prasad, 2009)) followed by superselective embolization using various embolic agents. The most frequently-used agents are embolic spheres of different sizes, that can provide permanent tumor vessels occlusion (choosing spheres diameter depends on expected vessel penetration), but IRs also can use polymorphic PVA agents (also permanent occlusion), gelfoam particles (temporary occlusion) or combinations of those. Described method are effective alternative to surgery. Embolization can be performed even in the in patients in shock and with high procedure success. The patient does not require special preparations. Despite obvious advantages and minimally invasive character of the procedure, in some cases embolization can lead to serious complications. In retrospective study of Matityahu et al. (Matityahu et al., 2013) authors report 11 % chance of complications, including one case of bladder necrosis from cohort of 98 patients. Serious complications were reported in all patients who underwent bilateral embolization. A major complication as bladder necrosis is described within the first 4 – 5 [*]weeks following the embolization (Ali et al., 2014; Sieber, 1994), however, we have found data of bladder necrosis in earlier post-operative period (two weeks after intervention) (Sieber, 1994; Samuel Washington & Benjamin, 2016).|$|R

30|$|In the Swift operation, {{as in the}} {{previously}} proposed nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, the deep lateral part of the parametrium is not removed. Is this a problem from a radicality point of view? We think not. We have seen {{no significant difference in}} the survival or local recurrence rate since we started with nerve-sparing surgery in 2001 / 2002. Some concern about the importance of removing the deep lateral portion of the parametrium has been expressed by the authors of the so-called “giant section” studies, in which the whole of the parametrium from the uterus to the pelvic side wall was embedded for pathology assessment. In these studies also, lymph nodes in the deep lateral part of the parametrium were found. In the giant-section studies, parametrial resection is performed before the pelvic lymphadenectomy, making it impossible to distinguish these nodes as “deep lateral parametrial” or “deep medial obturator.” We have found that, after an extensive and deep lymphadenectomy in which the lymph-bearing tissue dorsally from the superior <b>vesical</b> <b>arteries</b> is also removed, apart from the autonomous nerves, hardly any tissue remains in the area that is called the deep lateral parametrium. The only tissue that can be found is directed in a more distal course towards the bladder and is to be regarded as bladder mesentery. Furthermore, in the giant section technique, it is not possible to distinguish between parametrium and uterosacral ligamentous tissue.|$|R

Physical examination was non-remarkable. Cystoscopy revealed a bluish-red, sessile tumor {{about the size of}} a hen's egg at the left inferolateral bladder wall. Excretory urography showed the small filling defect at the left bladder floor. Computed tomography confirmed that the tumor had invaded deep into the muscle layer of the bladder wall.

In our case computed tomography was useful for this purpose. We suggest that partial cystectomy should be the preferred choice when the patient is preoperatively confirmed to have a high-stage hemangioma, whereas transurethral resection may suffice when the hemangioma is confirmed to be at a low stage.

So this disease was poorly diagnosed and only thirty cases have been reported since Hyams described the first case in 1929. But it may become more common lesion, if the differential diagnosis from the lower ureteral stenosis is taken into consideration. We wish to present two cases with obstruction of the juxtavesical ureter due to the umbilical and uterine artery, respectively. First patient was a 13 -year-old boy complaining of albuminuria. Another was a 38 -year-old woman suffering from left flank pain. Excretory urograms showed juxtavesical ureteral obstruction with hydroureteronephrosis. Ureteral catheter could be introduced into the renal pelvis without difficulties in both cases. Surgical exploration revealed that right lower ureter was obstructed at the juxtavesical portion by the pulsatile umbilical artery {{in the first case}} and that left juxtavesical ureter was obstructed by the anterior and posterior branches of the uterine artery in the other case. Since the dilated ureter did not decrease in size after division of the aberrant vessel, ureteroneocystostomy was performed in both cases. Postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative excretory urograms showed almost no improvement of hydroureteronephrosis three months later in the first case and one month later in the other case.
