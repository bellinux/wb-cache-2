The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of {{one aspect of the}} treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained.|$|E

When people with NPD enter treatment, it is typically prompted by life difficulties or to seek relief from another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders, or at the insistence of relatives and friends. This is partly because individuals with NPD generally have poor insight and <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> their perception and behavior as inappropriate and problematic due to their very positive self-image.|$|E
25|$|Income varies {{considerably}} from near the national median to well {{in excess of}} US$100,000.

The middle classes are very influential, as they encompass the majority of voters, writers, teachers, journalists, and editors. Most societal trends in the U.S. originate within the middle classes.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{have long}} admired the playwright's suspenseful {{handling}} of the Keller family's burden in the play All My Sons. The critical character in this work is Joe Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake {{because it would have}} driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity. Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.|$|E
25|$|Many {{physicians}} also recommend {{changes in}} diet to treat chronic headaches. Many chronic headache sufferers <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> foods or beverages as headache factors, because the consumption may not consistently cause headaches or the headaches may be delayed. Many {{of the chemicals}} in certain foods can cause chronic headaches, including caffeine, monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrites, nitrates, tyramine, and alcohols. Some of the foods and beverages that chronic headache sufferers are advised to avoid include caffeinated beverages, chocolate, processed meats, cheese and fermented dairy products, fresh yeast-risen baked goods, nuts, and alcohol as well as certain fruits and vegetables. Additionally, people may have differing dietary triggers on an individualized basis, because not all foods affect people the same way. Different medical professionals suggest different ways of testing or changing diets. Some may suggest eliminating {{a few of the}} potentially headache-causing foods at a time {{for a short period of}} time, while others suggest removing all the threatening foods from a person's diet and slowly adding a couple back at a time. Yet, others may not suggest diet modification at all. The treatment of chronic headaches through changes in diet is based on personal opinion, and, therefore, controversial.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, {{within weeks}} of Hitler's rise to power in Germany, the German Consul-General in Jerusalem for Palestine, Heinrich Wolff, sent a {{telegram}} to Berlin reporting al-Husseini's belief that Palestinian Muslims were enthusiastic about the new regime and {{looked forward to the}} spread of Fascism throughout the region. Wolff met al-Husseini and many sheikhs again, a month later, at Nabi Musa. They expressed their approval of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany and asked Wolff not to send any Jews to Palestine. Wolff subsequently wrote in his annual report for that year that the Arabs' political naïvety led them to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the link between German Jewish policy and their problems in Palestine, and that their enthusiasm for Nazi Germany was devoid of any real understanding of the phenomenon. The various proposals by Palestinian Arab notables like al-Husseini were rejected consistently over the years out of concern to avoid disrupting Anglo-German relations, in line with Germany's policy of not imperilling their economic and cultural interests in the region by a change in their policy of neutrality, and respect for British interests. Hitler's Englandpolitik essentially precluded significant assistance to Arab leaders. Italy also made the nature of its assistance to the Palestinian contingent on the outcome of its own negotiations with Britain, and cut off aid when it appeared that the British were ready to admit the failure of their pro-Zionist policy in Palestine. Al-Husseini's adversary, Ze'ev Jabotinsky had at the same time cut off Irgun ties with Italy after the passage of antisemitic racial legislation.|$|E

500|$|When hunting {{most other}} salticids in Queensland, P. fimbriata exaggerates the {{slowness}} and [...] "choppiness" [...] of its normal gait (sometimes called [...] "robotlike") and holds its palps retracted beside its fangs, as {{it also does}} in the cryptic rest pose. If the salticid prey faces P. fimbriata, P. fimbriata freezes until the prey turns away. This [...] "cryptic stalking" [...] appears unique to Queensland, where most other jumping spiders <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> a disguised stalking P. fimbriata as a predator, or even as an animal at all. P. fimbriata from Queensland uses cryptic stalking against both salticids native to Queensland and against imported salticids. Other salticids often defend themselves when stalked by other species of Portia or by P. fimbriata outside Queensland, and the Queensland P. fimbriata′s cryptic stalking may be a regional adaptation to the abundant but dangerous salticid prey, especially Jacksonoides queenslandicus, in the local rainforest. P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking even against some oddly-shaped salticids such as the flattened Holoplatys and the elongated, mantis-like Mantisatta longicauda. All of P. fimbriata′s salticid prey have a pair of large, forward-facing principal eyes, a feature that arachnologists also use to distinguish salticids from all other spiders.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
