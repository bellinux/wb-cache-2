25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E

500|$|McEvilly {{signed a}} {{permanent}} two-year deal with Cambridge the following 2008–09 season, after being released on a free transfer from Accrington Stanley. On 10 October, {{he was sent}} off in the 87th minute of Cambridge's 1–0 win over Weymouth, for violent conduct after the referee deemed a tackle to be dangerous. He went on to make 18 appearances for Cambridge scoring eight goals in the Conference National, {{before returning to the}} Football League to rejoin Rochdale, initially on loan in November, with the possibility of a permanent transfer in January. McEvilly stated he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> [...] "home" [...] at Rochdale.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the SpongeBob special, Patchy finds Encino {{shrunk to}} a very small size, and then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norbluck 5, was playing with his Shrink-A-Tron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size, and he keeps saying, “There’s no place like home." [...] (Obviously parodying the scene from The Wizard of Oz) Sympathetic by Patchy's misery that he wants to go home because he missed it the entire story, Norbluck 5's mother gets the Shrink-A-Tron given from her son, and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado {{disaster}} to fix it up. Then, Patchy is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).|$|E
2500|$|The Kinks left RCA Records in 1977, {{switching}} to Arista. The group shed {{all of the}} extra backing vocalists and brass instrumentalists that had accompanied them throughout their theatrical years, and reverted to a five-piece rock group again. Their debut LP for Arista was entitled Sleepwalker, and was a commercial and critical comeback for the group. It was the first album in what critics usually call the [...] "arena rock" [...] phase of the group, in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed. Dave later commented that he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> to more guitar-oriented songs, and he has listed Sleepwalker {{as one of his}} favourites. His composition and earnest, almost desperate lead vocals, not to mention his particularly ripping lead guitar sound, led to airplay — especially on college stations — for his idealistic [...] "Trust Your Heart" [...] on the 1978 Misfits album.|$|E

2500|$|D'Antoni's {{coaching}} {{debut with}} the Lakers was delayed as he recovered from knee replacement surgery. [...] He had surgery weeks before on October 31, as he originally expected {{that he was}} taking a year off from coaching and would have months to recover. Bickerstaff continued to be the Lakers' interim coach; he finished with a [...] 4–1 record, winning his last two as D'Antoni started leading team practices. Older brother Dan D'Antoni was named a new assistant coach and also assisted. In his first press conference, D'Antoni predicted that the Lakers, then 3–5 and ranked 20th in scoring with 96.5 points per game, should instead be scoring [...] "110–115 points a game". He wanted to revive Showtime. He reiterated general manager Mitch Kupchak's belief that the Lakers were built to win an NBA championship that season. D'Antoni was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> with Nash, noting his unsuccessful stint with the New York Knicks without him. On November 20, he coached his first game—nine days after he was hired—in a 95–90 win against the Brooklyn Nets. The Lakers matched their worst start on the road (0–4) since the 1995–96 season, but snapped the streak with a 115–89 win over the Dallas Mavericks; it was also their first 100-point effort in the first four games under D'Antoni.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have from}} far back so dragged you, and the gentle Letitia even, not less, through the deep dark desperate {{discipline}} of my unmatched genius {{for not being}} quick on the epistolary trigger, that, with such a perfection of schooling--quite my prize pupils and little show performers in short--I can be certain that you won't so much as have turned a hair under my recent probably unsurpassed exhibitions of it. Nevertheless I shall expect you to sit up and look bright and gratified (even quite intelligent--like true heads of the class) now that I do write and reward your exemplary patience and beautiful drill. Yes, dear prize pupils, I feel I can fully depend on you to regard the present as a [...] "regular answer" [...] to your sweet letter from Bermuda; or to behave, beautifully, as if you did--which comes to the same thing. Above all I can trust {{you to believe that}} if your discipline has been stiff, that of your battered and tattered old disciplinarian himself has been stiffer--incessant and uninterrupted and really not leaving him a moment's attention for anything else. He is still very limp and bewildered with it all--yet with a gleam of better things ahead, that after his dire and interminable ordeal, and though the gleam has but just broken out, causes him to turn to you again with that fond fidelity which enjoyed its liveliest expression, in the ancient past, on the day, never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgotten, when we had such an affectionate scuffle to get ahead of each other in making a joyous bonfire of Lamb House in honour of your so acclaimed arrival there: Letitia sitting by, with her impartial smile, as the queen of beauty at a Tournament. (She will remember how she crowned the victor--I modestly forbear to name him: and what a ruinously--to him--genial feu de joie resulted from the expensive application of my brandished torch.) Well, the upshot of it all is that I have put off my sailing by the Mauretania of June 14th--but not alas to your Olympic, vessel of the gods, evidently, later that month. I have shifted to the same Mauretania of August 2nd--urgent and intimate family reasons making for my stop-over till then. So when I see you in England, as I fondly count on doing after this dismal interlude, it will be during the delightful weeks you will spend there in the autumn, when all your athletic laurels have been gathered, all your high-class hotels checked off, all your obedient servants (except me!) tipped, and all your portentous drafts honoured. Let us plot out those sweet September days a little even now--let me at least dream of them as a supreme test, proof and consecration, of what returning health will once more enable me <b>to</b> stand. I <b>am</b> too unutterably <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going <b>back</b> even with a further delay--I <b>am</b> wasted <b>to</b> a shadow (even though the shadow of a still formidable mass) by homesickness (for the home I once had--before we applied the match. You see the loss for you now--by the way: if you had only allowed it to stand!) I have taken places in the Reform Gallery [...] "for the coronation"--and won them by ballot--for the second procession: and now palmed them off on two of my female victims--after such a quandary in the choice! Apropos of coronations and such-like, won't you, when you write, very kindly give me some news of the dear dashing Abbeys, long lost to sight and sound of me? It has come round to me in vague ways that they have at last actually left Morgan Hall for some newly-acquired princely estate: do you know where and what the place is? A gentle word on this head would immensely assuage my curiosity. Where-ever and whatever it is, let us stay there together next September! You see therefore how practical my demand is. Of course Ned will paint this coronation too--while his hand is in. And oh you should <b>be</b> here now <b>to</b> share a holy rage with me.... Such is this babyish democracy.|$|R
