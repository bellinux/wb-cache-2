40|$|AbstractSerial {{numbers are}} used as unique {{identification}} marks {{for a range of}} items, but these can be erased by offenders involved in criminal activities such as theft or illegal use of stolen items, so that the origin and ownership cannot be traced. Nowadays many methods are available to restore the erased serial number. Chemical etching is the most common and successful method for restoration of serial numbers on the metal surface. About 10 different reagents of which most of them are copper and iron containing, less toxic, less hazardous compounds were chosen for etching. The erased surfaces were etched with every one of these etchants using the swabbing method. The relative sensitivity and efficiency of these reagents in recovering marks obliterated by grinding are described on the basis of experimental results observed.

SEM and TEM observation indicate that every horn of six-horn-like MnO nanocrystals is constructed with a bundle of nanorods growing along the [100] direction. Adequate evidence provided by time- and temperature-dependent experiments demonstrates that. the formation of such branched MnO {{can be divided into}} two processes, i. e., the formation of octahedron-based MnO exposed with polar surfaces and sequent directional etching. In this mechanism, the mixed solvent of organic amines and OA provides favorable circumstances for the formation of MOD octahedra, and at the same time, OA as the <b>etching</b> <b>reagent</b> is responsible for the evolution of six-hom-like MnO from octahedron-based MnO.

30|$|Nanomaterials, {{which have}} {{received}} a wide recognition for their size- and shape-dependent properties, {{as well as their}} practical applications that might complement their bulk counterparts, have been extensively investigated since last century [1 – 8]. Among them, one-dimensional (1 D) tubular nanostructures with hollow interiors have attracted tremendous research interest since the discovery of carbon nanotubes [1, 9 – 14]. Most of the available single-crystalline nanotubes structurally possess layered architectures; the nanotubes with a non-layered structure have been mostly fabricated by employing porous membrane films, such as porous anodized alumina as template, which are either amorphous, polycrystalline, or only in ultrahigh vacuum [13, 14]. The fabrication of single-crystalline semiconductor nanotubes is advantageous in many potential nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and biochemical-sensing applications [1]. Particularly, microscopically endowing these single-crystalline nanotubes with a nanoporous feature can further broaden their practical applications in catalysis, bioengineering, environments protection, sensors, and related areas due to their intrinsic pores and the high surface-to-volume ratio. However, it still remains a big long-term challenge to develop those simple and low-cost synthetic technologies to particularly fabricate 1 D nanotubes for functional elements of future devices. Recently, the authors have rationally designed a general thermal oxidation strategy to synthesize polycrystalline porous metal oxide hollow architectures including 1 D nanotubes [15]. In this article, a solution-etching route for the fabrication of single-crystalline nanoporous Nb 2 O 5 nanotubes with NH 4 F as an <b>etching</b> <b>reagent,</b> which can be easily transformed from Nb 2 O 5 nanorod precursors is presented.|$|E
40|$|This thesis work is an {{experimental}} study of one type of Semi-Solid Metal casting (SSM) process which is called RheoMetalTM. This method is an efficient type of Rheocasting that creates a semi-solid slurry within 30 seconds that is used for a high pressure die casting machine. The purpose of using a slurry in a high pressure die casting machine is that the slurry has a higher viscosity due to its solid fraction. This makes the filling of the die cavity more laminar which reduces air entrapment in the casting. The difficulty {{with this type of}} casting is to control the process parameters to be able to insure a casting with desired properties. A few studies within RheoMetalTM has already been made but there is still a lack of knowledge of to what extent the process parameters affect the slurry. The goal in this work is to study how the different RheoMetalTM process parameters influence the primary α-Al solid fraction, shape and size. The process parameters that were studied in this work was the stirring rate, superheat and EEM amount. In this study, the so called growth layer has been removed to make more precise calculations of the primary α-Al. This work also aims to study how grain refinement affect the primary α-Al which is commonly used {{to improve the quality of}} castings. To be able to perform this study, both practical and theoretical work has been implemented. The casting process involved making of ladles and preparation of various equipment. The cast samples were then prepared by standard metallurgy procedure for optical analyse of the microstructure. A special <b>etching</b> <b>reagent</b> was used to analyse the microstructure in a microscope. The etching is called Weck’s reagent and its purpose is to differentiate the growth layer from the primary α-Al. The growth layer is formed during quenching and by excluding it, the calculation of the slurry’s primary α-Al becomes more precise. This is because the slurry is not quenched before it is inserted into the high pressure die casting machine, therefore no growth layer is formed. To analyse the cast samples, a special program was used to identify and to calculate the solid fraction, shape and size of the primary α-Al. The result from the calculations made by the program gave different tendencies when changing the EEM amount. The stirring rate showed a tendency to decrease the solid fraction and increase the shape factor. The superheat decreased the solid fraction and increased the shape factor. The grain refinement also decreased the solid fraction and increased the shape factor. There was no clear tendency showing that the equivalent circular diameter of the primary α-Al was affected by any of the parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{avoidance}} of shrinkage porosity and metal expansion penetration defects {{as well as}} the control of the size and number of eutectic colonies and the tensile properties of the casting are issues of major importance in the production of lamellar cast iron. These defects, characteristics and properties are related to the microstructure that develops during solidification. An improved control of this features derive from our understanding of how the microstructure changes until its final state and our capacity to accurately measure such changes. The aim of this work is to enhance such understanding in hypoeutectic grey cast iron and provide experimental and analytical techniques to facilitate a deeper investigation of the solidification phenomena. Interrupted solidification, natural solidification, direct austempering after solidification treatment, cooling curve analysis, Fourier thermal analysis, different <b>etching</b> <b>reagents,</b> non-standard image processing techniques and stereological relations are combined {{for the first time to}} study the development of the microstructure from the beginning of the solidification to the as-cast state. Stereological relations are successfully combined with bi-dimensional observations to approximate tri-dimensional parameters of the microstructure in single or multiple sections analysis. The fundamental phenomenon of the coarsening of the primary phase (reduction of the primary austenite surface) and the increase of the secondary dendrite arm spacing are observed to occur prior, during and after the eutectic solidification in different cooling conditions. The validity of the secondary dendrite arm spacing as a measure of coarsening is assessed. The ease of flow for the interdendritic melt is characterized in terms of the hydraulic diameter of the interdendritic phase, which captures the improved flow conditions during the eutectic phase. The change of and interdependence between the inverse surface area per unit volume, secondary dendrite arm spacing, the cube root of time, solidification time, eutectic colony diameter and cooling rate {{as well as the}} change of fraction of primary austenite is presented.

40|$|Most {{embryonic}} {{development and}} tissue self-assembly requires {{the integration of}} cell movements within multiple cell layers composed of different cell types, which are integrated with the signaling networks in these 3 D environments. Although the role of cell mechanics in tissue self-assembly has been demonstrated, {{little is known about}} the mechanical responses of 3 D multi-layer tissues to chemical cues. To investigate the collective movements within multilayered tissues, I developed a novel microfluidic technique capable of removing desired height or width of tissue from a composite tissue. I call this technique 2 ̆ 23 D tissue-etching 2 ̆ 2 because it is analogous to techniques used in the microelectromechanics (MEMS) field where complex 3 D structures are built by successively removing material from a monolithic solid through subtractive manufacturing. I used a custom-designed microfluidic control system to deliver a range of tissue <b>etching</b> <b>reagents</b> (detergents, chelators, proteases, etc.) to specific regions of multilayered tissues microsurgically isolated from embryos of the African Clawtoed frog, Xenopus laevis. Xenopus embryos and explanted tissues have long been used to elucidate signaling and other cellular processes during development and here provide an ideal model 3 D tissue etching. Long exposure to a narrow etchant stream cuts completely through cell-cell layers to expose the substrate. By reducing the exposure time a single layer may be removed. By controlling the width of the etchant and the exposure time a broader swath of the surface layer may be removed. For more refined etching, after removal of a broad swath the resistance circuits can be switched and a second narrow stream can remove only a single narrow band within the swath exposed cells. I developed tissue-etching techniques that allow me to shape complex multi-layered embryonic tissues. The ability to control 3 D stimulation and the form of multicellular tissues will provide extend the tools of tissue engineering to synthesize highly complex 3 D integrated multicellular biosystems.

40|$|While proanthocyanidins (PA) are {{effective}} in improving collagen’s resistance to collagenolytic degradation, the direct incorporation of PA into an adhesive system is detrimental to the light-curing thereof. Conversely, the use of PA as a primer could circumvent this issue, but {{little is known about}} the efficacy of PA in stabilizing collagen when applied in a clinically relevant manner. This study investigated the pre- and post-digestion mor-phology of an acid-etched dentin collagen layer that underwent PA treatment for time periods on a scale of seconds. The null hypothesis, that there is no difference between the PA-treated and untreated control group, had to be rejected, since it was revealed that the untreated control could not sur-vive 1 hr of exogenous collagenase digestion, while the PA-treated collagen could sustain at least 16 hrs of digestion with no perceptible changes in collagen structure. In addition, the stabilizing effect of the gold-standard cross-linker glutaralde-hyde at comparable experimental conditions was found to be almost non-existent within the 5, 15, or 30 sec of cross-linking permitted. Therefore, PA have been proven to be extraordinarily efficient in stabilizing demineralized dentin collagen against enzymatic challenges in a clinically relevant set-ting, likely due to the non-covalent nature of their interaction with collagen molecules.

Its side effect, however, is that abrasive particles are embedded in the treated surface, which can be up to 30 % of the surface and it constitutes the side effect of this procedure. Such a significant participation of foreign material can not be indifferent to the properties of the surface. Embedded particles can be the place of stress concentration causing cracking of ceramics, and may deteriorate corrosion resistance by forming corrosive microlinks. In the latter cases, it would be advisable to remove elements embedded into the surface. The simplest method is chemical etching or electrochemical one. Nevertheless, these procedures should not significantly change the parameters of the surface. Among many possible reagents only a few fulfills all the above conditions.
