This creature multiple different variations, consisting of red, blue, white, silver. The white and silver Lynel variants only appear in Breath of the Wild. In that game, red and blue Lynel can be found in many places. The white one appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> too, but mostly in colder climates. They can be found naturally in Gerudo Highlands and N. Tabantha Snowfield. Every Lynel, except for the one in Shatterback Point northeast of Zoras Domain, will become Silver after being beaten enough. After every Blood Moon, the Lynels type will change to a stronger variant (i.e. a defeated red Lynel will become a blue Lynel after being defeated). The only, initially spawned Silver Lynel is in the Colosseum Ruins in Central Hyrule. Two Lynels also appear in Hyrule Castle in both Gatehouses. A blue one will initially spawn in the first Gatehouse and white one in the second one. They wont spawn until the player has entered the gatehouse from jumping through a window or entering through the gate, which will be blocked off after the player has entered. The only exit is by climbing up or using Revalis Gale through a window. They first appeared in The Legend of Zelda.|$|E

5000|$|Hip Hop {{studies has}} not grown without critics, {{both within and}} outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and {{community}} activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics {{who may or may not}} have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all. In an article published by the San Francisco Globe in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: [...] "You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension." [...] Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done. Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self-self-proccalimed [...] "hip hop head." [...] Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively.Other critics, such as Alex Beam a columnist for The Boston Globe, have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the [...] "celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women," [...] in mainstream rap and Hip Hop.|$|E

[...] — Zeldin, on the Golden Silence. On July 27, 2010, the Narrative released their self-titled studio album The Narrative. After its release, they went in national tour on to promote the album. In 2011 the band made its first performance at the festival Vans Warped Tour in July followed by another CMJ Music Marathon performance in the end of the year. Later in 2012, the Narrative stated to AbsolutePunk, that they had begun writing and working on their second studio album. Recording sessions began on March 26, 2012. The band chose to record the album in a different way of the previous, recorded entirely in a closed studio. They spent one month recording the most part of the instrumentals, vocals and sounds elements and producing it, at an English cathedral barn built in 1900, in Upstate New York, Hunter. The recordings in the barn were finished in April 2012, after that the duo went to the studio Red Wire Audio in Brooklyn to finish the album tracking. The album was produced by Bryan Russell, who has produced the previous albuns released by the band, and Justin Long. The band also worked with the music producer and mixer, Richard Flack, who has previously produced records for Florence and the Machine and Robbie Williams. Without a drummer member, the duo was helped by their friend Jay Scalchunes and also by Ari Sadowitz, who recorded the bass. The Narrative had announced the album's release date to the summer of 2012, but the date was delayed, due its conclusion. On June 3, 2014 was announced through their official website, its first single from the album titled [...] "Chasing a Feeling" [...] released on June 3, 2014. While Zeldin went on tour with the Americana band Twin Forks, Gabriel started recording an solo album with Russell. The project was announced through the Narrative's Facebook account on February 15, 2014 and on October 12, Gabriel released the album Here, Sit, Stay through digital download.|$|E

Turkish language teaching have been doing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> {{both at home and}} abroad. Interests in Turkish language have been increasing day by day. Accordingly, eligible course materials and syllabus are required. However, the institutions which teach Turkish prepare the course materials {{on the basis of the}} syllabus they prepare on their own. These syllabuses reflect different approaches in terms of content. As a result, there have been differences in the contents of coursebooks. This shows that there is not an international attitude towards teaching Turkish to foreigners although it is seen as a matter of approach. This international situation can only be overcome via CEF language teaching syllabus which is applied by European union, European Union member and non-member countries therefore, this study aims to prepare Turkish language teaching syllabus in line with the Common European Framework at A 1 - A 2 level for foreigners who want to learn Turkish by considering the cultural and structural aspects of our language. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{an honor}} for me to share these moments with you exchanging {{thoughts}} about, today, the most important questions {{in the domain of}} financial intermediation. It is my special pleasure that my address will open the 23 rd Annual Conference of the Group of Banking Supervisors from Central and Eastern Europe. There {{is no doubt that the}} key words for every supervisory body are liquidity and solvency, as quantities and qualities which are permanently testing the resilience of the banking system in its functioning. Therefore, the standards for liquidity and solvency are constantly being checked from two key aspects: (1) whether, amid various adverse shocks, they are set to maintain satisfactory resilience of the banking system and (2) whether the points of calibration of these key categories at the same time enable efficient, rational financial intermediation. The financial crisis that began in August 2007 clearly shocked the world with its sharpness and, now we can say, its length.

40|$|In an offset {{printing}} machine the rollers (ink unit) and the cylinders (printing unit) are in contact <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places.</b> The contact surfaces comprise a metal surface and a rubber surface. As appears from findings {{based on the}} professional literature and experience of people working in printing houses the issue of contact between ink rollers and printing cylinders in an {{offset printing}} machine is of great importance. It has impact {{on the quality of}} printouts (generation of printouts errors), consumption of energy, time of making the printing machine ready for operation, wear of the machine’s components and related consumables like ink, dampening solution, paper, ink rollers, plate. During the theoretical studies, the equations were derived to show how the rollers compression depends on the contact area width and clamping force. The equations involve Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of rollers ’ materials. The difference between these equations and the so far existing equations has resulted from changing the place of applying the clamping force and involving Poisson’s ratio. The paper includes the comparison of the aforesaid new equations and those known from the literature. Moreover, the relation-ship in between the contact area width and the compression of metal roller and rubber-covered roller was subject to experimental at-tempts aimed at verification of the equation presented. In order to measure the rollers compression a clock sensor was used, and for measurement of the contact area width – a device called Roller Nip Control. The results of these measurements are presented in this paper and are compared with the results obtained from the equation derived in the course of theoretical studies using the analytical method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Stormwater {{is defined}} as rain- and melted water. Ludvika kommun had little knowledgde about the {{stormwater}} that reaches a specific recipient Lyviken. Therefore they intended to do an research of the stormwater that leads down to Lyviken. The aim with {{this study was to}} assess the quality of the contents in the stormwater based on pH, conductivity, phosphorous, nitrogen, bacterias, oil and one sample that meassured the value of several methals.   Since the population has increased for decades, the area of hard surfaces and asphalts areas also has increased. This can increase the pollutions that finally ends up in the recipient. Depending on what activity that {{is going on in the}} nearby area the pollutions that comes with the stormwater is a variety. The catchment area of Lyviken is approxiametely 2 000 000 m 2 and the quality of the stormwater differs a lot, depending on where it comes from.   The conclusion of this study is that there were not any chocking values of methals in the water and that the content of oil were pretty good except for three samples. Nitrogen and phosphorous exceeded the limits in most of the samples and in the majority of the samples the content of bacteria were way too much. The contents of bacteria should have been decreasing during the last years since an improvement in the water pipes has been taken place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> in Sweden, but that doesn’t seem to be the case in Ludvika. The reason why there is a lot of bacteria is probably because the pipes sometimes get filled to the brim with sewagewater.   Keywords: stormwater, recipient, Lyviken, stormwater quality, pollutions.

40|$|Sketch ” C(X) {{with respect}} to some {{function}} f is a compression of data X. It allows us computing f(X) (with approximation) given access only to C(X). • Sometimes f has 2 arguments. For data X and Y, we want to compute f(X,Y) given C(X), C(Y). • Motivation: maybe you have some input data and I have some input data, {{and we want to}} compute some similarity measure of these two databases across the data items. One way is that I can just send you the database, and you can compute locally the similarity measure, and vise versa. But image these are really big data sets, and I don’t want to send the entire data across the wire, rather what I will do is to compute the sketch of my data, and then send the sketch to you, which is something very small after compression. Now the sketch C(X) is much smaller than X, and given the sketch you can compute the function. • Trivial example: image you have a batch of numbers, and I also have a batch of numbers. We want to compute their sum. The sketch I can do is just locally sum all my input data, and send you the sum. • Streaming: we want to maintain a sketch C(X) on the fly as x is updated. In previous example, if numbers come on the fly, I can keep a running sum, which is a streaming algorithm. The streaming setting appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places,</b> for example, your router can monitor online traffic. You can sketch the number of traffic to find the traffic pattern. 2. Dimensionality Reduction • Input data is high-dimensional. Dimensionality reduction transforms high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional version, such that for the computational problem you are considering, once you solve the problem on the lower-dimensional transformed data, you can get approximate solution on original data. Since the data is in low dimension, your algorithm can run faster. • Application: speed up clustering, nearest neighbor, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders, as some {{of psychiatric}} disorders, which also include childhood autism, atypical autism, Asperegs´syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett syndrome, {{are considered to be}} significant anomalies in children´s development, which are characterized by problems in communication, social interaction and behavior. These are the typical symptoms creating barriers between children and their families, medical personnel, or environment. Despite all efforts to improve the care for children with autism spectrum disorders, the situation is generally unsatisfying. Counseling services are not available in all regions and specialized preschool and school facilities are missing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places.</b> Also, specialists´ awareness is often insufficient and even in health care facilities unfamiliarity with the issue of children with autism spectrum disorders may be seen. On the part of the public a negative reaction, misunderstanding and prejudice against these children and their families are still being expressed, making autism spectrum disorders stigmatizing. A nurse as a professional provides the care through the nursing process, in which her role consists not only in provision of the direct nursing care, but she also takes {{on the role of the}} child´s rights advocate and a mediator for information exchange between the child, the parent, the doctor and herself. In the care of children with autistic spectrum disorders, a nurse provides not only nursing care, but also educational care with the aim to support the child's development. In order to succeed in her efforts, the nurse needs a large portion of empathy, patience and communication skills and all the support and cooperation on the part of the child's parents. The above conclusions are related to objectives of the research carried out using in-depth interviews, during which we wanted to determine if this disease is stigmatizing for families caring for a child with autism and also the way a nurse participates in cooperation with the family. The third objective was to define the specifics of nursing care for children with autism spectrum disorders, from which standards of nursing care for these children were established. Based on the objectives and the study of available resources, four research questions were stated. First: Is the disease stigmatizing for families caring for a child with autism? Second: What is the impact of autism on families caring for a child with this disease? Third: What is the way a nurse participates in cooperation with families caring for a child with autism? And fourth: What are the specifics of nursing care for a child with autism? All the objectives were met. We hope that this thesis will provide nurses with so much information on the issue of nursing care for children with autism spectrum disorders, so that nurses could provide quality care based on the child's needs, and the cooperation with the family could become beneficial and joyful...|$|E
