40|$|AbstractCryo-electron {{microscopy}} (cryo-EM) {{has been}} widely used to explore conformational states of large biomolecular assemblies. The detailed interpretation of cryo-EM data requires the <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> of <b>a</b> known high-resolution protein structure into a low-resolution cryo-EM map. To this end, we have developed what we believe is a new method based on a two-bead-per-residue protein representation, and a modified form of the elastic network model that allows large-scale conformational changes while maintaining pseudobonds and secondary structures. Our method minimizes a pseudo-energy which linearly combines various terms of the modified elastic network model energy with a cryo-EM-fitting score and a collision energy that penalizes steric collisions. Unlike previous <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> efforts using the lowest few normal modes, our method effectively utilizes all normal modes so that both global and local structural changes can be fully modeled. We have validated our method for a diverse set of 10 pairs of protein structures using simulated cryo-EM maps {{with a range of}} resolutions and in the absence/presence of random noise. We have shown that our method is both accurate and efficient compared with alternative techniques, and its performance is robust to the addition of random noise. Our method is also shown to be useful for the <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> of three experimental cryo-EM maps...|$|R
40|$|Three-mode factor {{analysis}} models {{are often used}} in exploratory analysis of three-way data. However, in some situations it is a priori known that a particular constrained three-mode {{factor analysis}} (C 3 MFA) model describes an underlying process exactly. In such situations, <b>fitting</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 3 MFA model to a data set {{can be used for}} both quantitative analysis (e. g. estimating concentrations of a chemical substance in a mixture) and qualitative analysis (e. g. on the basis of certain subsets of parameters one can identify the substances present in a mixture). In this paper a general algorithm for <b>fitting</b> <b>a</b> range of such C 3 MFA models is proposed. Whether C 3 MFA is used for qualitative or quantitative analysis, in both cases it is crucial that the relevant parameter estimates are uniquely determinable. In the present paper it is discussed how and to what extent uniqueness of certain model parameters can be assessed. (C) 1998 John Whey & Sons, Lt...|$|R

The analysis was based on reported kinetic constants of C 4 Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and temperature responses of C 3 mesophyll conductance (g m). The estimates of g bs varied greatly with leaf temperature. The temperature response of g bs was well described by the peaked Arrhenius equation, with the optimum temperature being ~ 34 °C. The assumed temperature responses of g m had only a slight impact on the temperature response of g bs. In contrast, using extreme values of some enzyme kinetic constants changed the shape of the response, from the peaked optimum response to the non-peaked Arrhenius pattern. Further studies are needed to confirm such an Arrhenius response pattern from independent measurement techniques and to assess whether it is common across C 4 species. </p...|$|R
40|$|Trend {{estimation}} {{is important}} in many fields, though arguably the most important ap-plications appear in ecology. Trend is difficult to quantify; in fact, the term itself is not well-defined. Often, trend is quantified by estimating the slope coefficient in a regression model where the response variable is an index of population size, and time is the explanatory variable.

In this article, the choice of parameters for the fitting procedure is discussed. The quality of the fitting depends critically on the number of rigid pieces into which the model is divided.

We report a “pseudoatomic” {{model for the}} complex of PA 63 h and full-length LF determined by applying the normal-mode <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> procedure to <b>a</b> ∼ 18 Å cryo-electron microscopy (EM) density map of the complex. The model describes the interacting surface that buries a total area of ∼ 10, 140 Å 2 comprising ∼ 40 % charged, and ∼ 30 % each of polar and hydrophobic residues. For the heptamer, the buried surface, composed of ∼ 110 residues, involves primarily three monomers and includes for two, similar stretches of the polypeptide chain from domain 1. For LF, the interface again involves ∼ 110 residues, mostly from the N-terminal domain I (LFN), and the structurally homologous C-terminal domain IV. Most interestingly, bound LF displays a marked conformational change resulting from a “collapse” of domains I, III, and IV on domain II, with the largest movement of ∼ 9 Å noted for domain I. On the other hand, primarily, rigid-body movements, larger than ∼ 10 Å for three PA 63 monomers, cause the hourglass-shaped heptamer lumen to enlarge {{by as much as}} ∼ 50 % near the middle of the molecule.

A structural alignment of domains belonging to the superfamily, followed by a principal components analysis, is performed, and the first three principal components of the decomposition are explored. Using rigid body transformations for the secondary structure elements (SSEs) plus the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm to close the loops, stereochemically correct models are built for the structure to fit.

To test {{the usefulness of the}} method in refining atomic structures within cryoEM density we incorporated it into our <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> protocol (Flex-EM). Our benchmark includes 13 pairs of protein structures in two conformations each, one of which is represented by a corresponding cryoEM map. Refining the structures in simulated and experimental maps at the 5 - 15 Å resolution range using rigid bodies identified by RIBFIND shows a significant improvement over using individual SSEs as rigid bodies. For the 15 Å resolution simulated maps, using RIBFIND-based rigid bodies improves the initial fits by 40. 64 % on average, as compared to 26. 52 % when using individual SSEs. Furthermore, for some test cases we show that at the sub-nanometer resolution range the fits can be further improved by applying a two-stage refinement protocol (using RIBFIND-based refinement followed by an SSE-based refinement). The method is stand-alone and could serve as a general interactive tool for guiding <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> into EM maps...|$|R

40|$|Background: Proteins {{involved}} in mammalian mitochondrial translation, {{when compared to}} analogous bacterial proteins, frequently have additional sequence regions whose structural or functional roles are not always clear. For example, an additional short insert sequence in the bovine mitochondrial initiation factor 2 (IF 2 mt) seems sufficient to fulfill the added role of eubacterial initiation factor IF 1. Prior to our recent cryo-EM study that showed IF 2 mt to structurally occupy both the IF 1 and IF 2 binding sites, the spatial separation of these sites, and the short length of the insert sequence, posed ambiguity in whether it could perform the role of IF 1 through occupation of the IF 1 binding site on the ribosome. Results: The present study probes how well computational structure prediction methods can a priori address hypothesized roles of such additional sequences by creating quasi-atomic models of IF 2 mt using bacterial IF 2 cryo-EM densities (that lack the insert sequences). How such initial IF 2 mt predictions differ from the observed IF 2 mt cryo-EM map {{and how they can}} be suitably improved using further sequence analysis and <b>flexible</b> <b>fitting</b> are analyzed.
