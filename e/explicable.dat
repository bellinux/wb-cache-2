5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only <b>explicable</b> by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E
25|$|Typhoid: Normal CFTR {{proteins}} {{are also}} {{essential for the}} entry of Salmonella Typhi into cells, suggesting that carriers of mutant CFTR genes might be resistant to typhoid fever. No in vivo study has yet confirmed this. In both cases, {{the low level of}} cystic fibrosis outside of Europe, in places where both cholera and typhoid fever are endemic, is not immediately <b>explicable.</b>|$|E
25|$|What we call {{religious}} {{experiences can}} differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings {{that it would}} be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as <b>explicable</b> through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.|$|E
25|$|With his new residence, Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg, {{the mental}} {{inspiration}} behind the complex program, realized an architectural concept deeply {{influenced by the}} humanist notions of magic as the praxis of natural philosophy and of the rational order of the world. Above all, astronomy, astrology and alchemy were major components of the education of a worldly prince. In addition to representing the prince’s new rank, all these aspects flowed into {{the vision of the}} new building {{as a symbol of the}} cosmos as a well-organized, hierarchical, logico-mathematically <b>explicable</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In 886, Liutward, Bishop of Vercelli, took Berengar's sister {{from the}} nunnery of San Salvatore at Brescia {{in order to}} marry her to a {{relative}} of his; whether or not by force or by {{the consent of the}} convent and Charles the Fat, her relative, is uncertain. Berengar and Liutward had a feud that year, which involved his attack on Vercelli and plundering of the bishop's goods. Berengar's actions are <b>explicable</b> if his sister was abducted by the bishop, but if the bishop's actions were justified, then Berengar appears as the initiator of the feud. Whatever the case, bishop and margrave were reconciled shortly before Liutward was dismissed from court in 887.|$|E
25|$|At some point, {{probably}} in the late 12th century, for reasons unknown, the dependence of the priory on Haughmond was challenged by Great Bricett Priory in Suffolk, which sued for recognition as the mother house. Bricett also demanded that Haughmond give up its control of Wombridge Priory, which was still less <b>explicable,</b> as it had no control at all over Wombridge. Haughmond eventually got Bricett to drop its suit for a single payment of 40 shillings. However, the underlying tension resurfaced between Ranton, a fairly large house to be considered merely a cell, and Haughmond. After {{an appeal to the}} papacy, an enquiry set up by Bishop Roger Weseham gave Ranton full independence, although it was required to pay an annual pension of 100 shillings to Haughmond.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{technique of}} comparative linguistics {{is to compare}} phonological systems, morphological systems, syntax and the lexicon {{of two or more}} languages using techniques such as the comparative method. In principle, every difference between two related languages should be <b>explicable</b> to a high degree of plausibility and systematic changes, for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular (i.e. consistent). In practice, the comparison may be more restricted, e.g. just to the lexicon. In some methods {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct an earlier proto-language. Although the proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical, a reconstruction may have predictive power. The most notable example of this is Saussure's proposal that the Indo-European consonant system contained laryngeals, a type of consonant attested in no Indo-European language known at the time. The hypothesis was vindicated with the discovery of Hittite, which proved to have exactly the consonants Saussure had hypothesized in the environments he had predicted.|$|E
500|$|Monteverdi's first {{acknowledged}} opera is L'Orfeo (1607). He composed, in all, 24 {{works for}} the stage. Of these, ten are usually classified as operas, of which the music for seven has been lost apart from a few fragments. Most {{of what is known}} about the missing works comes from surviving librettos and other documentation, including Monteverdi's own extensive correspondence. Tim Carter, a leading Monteverdi scholar, suggests that the high rate of loss is <b>explicable</b> because, in Monteverdi's times, [...] "memories were short and large-scale musical works often had limited currency beyond their immediate circumstances".|$|E
500|$|Barry Schwartz, a {{sociologist}} who has examined America's cultural memory, argues {{that in the}} 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with [...] "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served [...] "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much <b>explicable</b> as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used {{the words of the}} Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, [...] "What would Lincoln do?" [...] However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this [...] "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness". He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.|$|E
500|$|.....I {{think all}} the grand leading facts of {{geographical}} distribution are <b>explicable</b> on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; {{and how it is}} that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent... On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar;...|$|E
500|$|Since Aaronson's poetry {{does not}} display formal innovation, {{literature}} professor William Baker, characterises him as [...] "A post-Georgian {{rather than a}} modernist [...] ". Baker further notes that Aaronson's poetry deals with several issues of his time, such as the rise of fascism and the Second World War, but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about the Holocaust. Upon Aaronson's death, the poet Arthur Chaim Jacobs compared him with Isaac Rosenberg, the more celebrated poet of the same Anglo-Jewish generation. According to Jacobs, Aaronson was [...] "clearly influenced by him in terms of diction, and {{in a kind of}} verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry. But he was less radical than Rosenberg in his use of language, and tended towards Keatsian luxuriance and sweetness." [...] The poet Jon Silkin also unfavourably compared Aaronson to Rosenberg, writing [...] "it cannot be said that his work attains to either the burning majesty or the depth of Rosenberg's poetry, and this is <b>explicable</b> perhaps by the fact that Aaronson does not altogether care to acknowledge his roots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Materialism {{is often}} {{associated}} with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description, if they are genuine, must be <b>explicable</b> in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not <b>explicable</b> in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor influentially argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in [...] "special sciences" [...] like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional {{medicine}} (also {{known as}} indigenous or folk medicine) comprises knowledge systems that developed over generations within various societies before {{the introduction of}} modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as [...] "the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether <b>explicable</b> or not, used in the maintenance of health {{as well as in}} the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness." ...|$|E
2500|$|This problem {{underscores}} a {{more fundamental}} question: whether the Holocaust can (or to what extent it should) be made <b>explicable</b> through a social-scientific, historical account. Speaking against what he terms [...] "quasi mystical association," [...] historian Nicolas Kinloch writes that [...] "with the publication of Raul Hilberg’s monumental book," [...] the subject had risen to be considered [...] "an event requiring more, rather than less, stringent historical analysis." [...] Citing Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer's statement that [...] "if the Holocaust was caused by humans, then it is as understandable as any other human event", Kinloch finally concludes that this [...] "will itself help to make any repetition of the Nazi genocide less likely".|$|E
2500|$|On August 24, 1981, the {{sentencing}} hearing took place. Two experts gave evidence on Chapman's behalf. Judge Edwards interrupted Dorothy Lewis, a research psychiatrist who was relatively inexperienced in the courtroom, {{indicating that the}} purpose of the hearing was to determine the sentence and that there was no question of Chapman's criminal responsibility. Lewis had maintained that Chapman's decision to change his plea did not appear reasonable or <b>explicable,</b> and she implied that the judge did not want to allow an independent competency assessment. The district attorney argued that Chapman committed the murder as an easy route to fame. When Chapman was asked if he had anything to say, he rose and read the passage from The Catcher in the Rye, when Holden tells his little sister, Phoebe, what he wants to do with his life: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{contest between}} the King and the Chancellor began during Sigismund's first Sejm sitting, the {{so-called}} [...] "Pacification Sejm", which met at Warsaw in March 1589. Zamoyski presented {{the project of}} a political combination between Poland, Moscovy, and Bohemia, coupled with a suggestion that in case the present King should die without issue (a somewhat premature and gratuitous assumption in the circumstances), none but a Prince of some Slavonic stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne. The extravagance of a project that could even imagine any sort of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy, and semi-Protestant Bohemia struck even {{the majority of the}} Sejm with amazement. It was only <b>explicable</b> as a circuitous and clumsy attempt to traverse the Habsburg influence. The Parliament promptly rejected it, accepting instead the royal proposition of a marriage between Sigismund and the Archduchess Anne. The way had already been opened for this rapprochement with Austria by the Treaty of Bytom and Będzin (March 1589), negotiated by the Nuncio Ippolito Aldobrandini, afterwards Pope Clement VIII, whereby the Emperor resigned all his claims to the Polish Crown.|$|E
2500|$|The AMA {{temporarily}} {{lost track}} of Swango, who managed {{to find a place}} in the psychiatric residency program at the State University of New York at Stony Brook School of Medicine. His first rotation was in the internal medicine department at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, New York. Once again his patients began dying for no <b>explicable</b> reason. Four months later, Kristin Kinney committed suicide, and arsenic was found in her body {{at the time of her}} death. Her mother, Sharon Cooper, was horrified to find out a person with Swango's history could be allowed to practice medicine. She got in touch with a friend of Kinney who was a nurse at Sanford. The nurse alerted Sanford's dean, Robert Talley, to Swango's whereabouts. Talley telephoned the dean at Stony Brook, Jordan Cohen. Under intense questioning from the head of Stony Brook's psychiatry department, Alan Miller, Swango admitted he had lied about his poisoning conviction in Illinois. He was immediately fired. [...] The public outcry resulted in Cohen and Miller being forced to resign before the end of the year. Before he resigned, Cohen sent a warning about Swango to all 125 medical schools and all 1,000 teaching hospitals across the nation, effectively blacklisting Swango from getting a medical residency in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Within his [...] Almagest Ptolemy {{explains}} that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years {{since the beginning of}} the reign of king Nabonassar (747 BC). [...] In chapter 9 of the Tetrabiblos he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena. [...] The colours of eclipses and [...] "the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like" [...] are considered along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of [...] "'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like". [...] Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of [...] "the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point". [...] It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being <b>explicable</b> only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources. [...] He also defends the [...] subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.|$|E
2500|$|In humans, {{there is}} good {{evidence}} that the basic human neural architecture underpinning the potential for flexible aggressive responses is influenced by genes as well as environment. In terms of variation between individual people, more than 100 twin and adoption {{studies have been conducted}} in recent decades examining the genetic basis of aggressive behavior and related constructs such as conduct disorders. According to a meta-analysis published in 2002, approximately 40% of variation between individuals is explained by differences in genes, and 60% by differences in environment (mainly non-shared environmental influences rather than those that would be shared by being raised together). However, such studies have depended on self-report or observation by others including parents, which complicates interpretation of the results. The few laboratory-based analyses have not found significant amounts of individual variation in aggression <b>explicable</b> by genetic variation in the human population. Furthermore, linkage and association studies that seek to identify specific genes, for example that influence neurotransmitter or hormone levels, have generally resulted in contradictory findings characterized by failed attempts at replication. One possible factor is an allele (variant) of the MAO-A gene which, in interaction with certain life events such as childhood maltreatment (which may show a main effect on its own), can influence development of brain regions such as the amygdala and as a result some types of behavioral response may be more likely. [...] The generally unclear picture has been compared to equally difficult findings obtained in regard to other complex behavioral phenotypes. For example, both 7R and 5R, ADHD-linked VNTR alleles of dopamine receptor D4 gene are directly associated with the incidence of proactive aggression in the men with no history of ADHD.|$|E
2500|$|The Guideline invoked by the University to deny {{third-party}} contractor {{payments on}} behalf of Wide Awake effects a sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry {{in the context of}} University sponsored publications. [...] The prohibition on funding {{on behalf of}} publications that [...] "primarily promote or manifest a particular belief in or about a deity or an ultimate reality", in its ordinary and commonplace meaning, has a vast potential reach. [...] The term [...] "promotes" [...] as used here would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in a deity or ultimate reality. [...] And the term [...] "manifests" [...] would bring within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is <b>explicable</b> as resting upon a premise that presupposes the extistence of a deity or ultimate reality. [...] Were the prohibition applied with much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical students such as Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. [...] And if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, those student journalistic efforts that primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no ultimate reality, then undergraduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some of their major essays excluded from student publications. [...] If any manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy. [...] Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point out their (necessary) imperfections.|$|E
2500|$|Relatively much {{is known}} about the native {{inhabitants}} in recent centuries, {{thanks in part to the}} efforts of the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, who documented his observations of life in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542. Fray Gerónimo Boscana, a Franciscan scholar who was stationed at San Juan Capistrano for more than a decade beginning in 1812, compiled what is widely considered to be the most comprehensive study of prehistoric religious practices in the San Juan Capistrano valley. Religious knowledge was secret, and the prevalent religion, called Chinigchinich, placed village chiefs in the position of religious leaders, an arrangement that gave the chiefs broad power over their people. Boscana divided the Acjachemen into two classes: the [...] "Playanos" [...] (who lived along the coast) and the [...] "Serranos" [...] (who inhabited the mountains, some three to four leagues from the Mission). The religious beliefs of the two groups as related to creation differed quite profoundly. The Playanos held that an all-powerful and unseen being called [...] "Nocuma" [...] brought about the earth and the sea, together with all of the trees, plants, and animals of sky, land, and water contained therein. The Serranos, on the other hand, believed in two separate but related existences: the [...] "existence above" [...] and the [...] "existence below." [...] These states of being were [...] "altogether <b>explicable</b> and indefinite" [...] (like brother and sister), and it was the fruits of the union of these two entities that created [...] "...the rocks and sands of the earth; then trees, shrubbery, herbs and grass; then animals". In 1908, noted cultural anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber published the following observations with regard to the Juaneño religious observances: ...|$|E
