40|$|Background and Aims Crown {{structure}} and above-ground biomass investment was studied {{in relation to}} light interception of trees and lianas growing in a 6 -month-old regenerating forest. Methods The vertical distribution of total above-ground biomass, height, diameter, stem density, leaf angles and crown depth were measured for individual plants of three short-lived pioneers (SLPs), four long-lived pioneers (LLPs) and three lianas. Daily light interception per individual Phi(d) was calculated with a canopy model. The model was then used to estimate light interception per unit of leaf mass (Phi(leaf mass)), total above-ground mass (Phi(mass)) and crown structure efficiency (E-a, the ratio of absorbed vs. available light). Key Results The SLPs Trema and Ochroma intercepted higher amounts of light per unit leaf mass (Phi(leaf mass)) because they had shallower crowns, resulting in higher crown use efficiency (E-a) than the other species. These SLPs (but not Cecropia) were also taller and intercepted more light per unit leaf area (Phi(area)). LLPs and lianas had considerably higher amounts of leaf mass and area per unit above-ground mass (LMR and LAR, respectively) and thus attained (Phi(msas) values similar to the SLPs (Phi(mass) = Phi(area) x LAR).

40|$|The flow <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which {{provides}} {{a measure of the}} fraction of streamlines that intercept a porous collector, is an important parameter in applications such as particle capture, filtration, and sedimentation. In this work, flow permeation through a porous circular cylinder located symmetrically between two impermeable parallel plates is investigated numerically under different flow and geometrical conditions. A flow <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> is defined and calculated based on the flow permeation rate {{for a wide range of}} system parameters. The dependencies on all physical variables can be captured in three dimensionless numbers: the Reynolds number, the Darcy number (ratio of permeability to the square of cylinder diameter), and the plate separation relative to the cylinder size. The flow <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> is very low in the limit of unbounded cylinders but significantly increases by restricting the flow domain. The fluid permeation rate through the porous cylinder varies nonlinearly with the relative plate/cylinder spacing ratio, especially when the gap between the cylinder and the confining plates is small compared to the cylinder size. In general, the effects of the Reynolds number, the Darcy number, and confinement on the flow <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> are coupled; however, for most practical cases it is possible to factorize these effects. For practical ranges of the Darcy number (Da< 10 [superscript − 4], which means that the pore size is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the porous cylinder diameter), the <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> varies linearly with Da, is independent of the Reynolds number at low Reynolds numbers (Re[subscript D]< 10), and varies linearly with Reynolds number at higher flow rates. In addition to numerical solutions, theoretical expressions are developed for the flow <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> in two limiting cases of confined and unbounded flow, based on modeling the system as a network of hydrodynamic resistances, which agree well with the numerical results. Furthermore, an expression for the drag coefficient on the porous cylinder is proposed as a function of the Darcy number which can be used in the limit of large plate/cylinder relative spacing.

40|$|Plants {{that use}} fog as an {{important}} water-source frequently have a rosette growth habit. The performance of this morphology in relation to fog interception has not been studied. Some first-principles from physics predict that narrow leaves, together with other ancillary traits (large number and high flexibility of leaves, caudices, and/or epiphytism) which constitute the "narrow-leaf syndrome" should increase fog-interception efficiency. This was tested using aluminum models of rosettes that differed in leaf length, width and number and were exposed to artificial fog. The results were validated using seven species of Tillandsia and four species of xerophytic rosettes. The total amount of fog intercepted in rosette plants increased with total leaf area, while narrow leaves maximized <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> (measured as interception per unit area). The number of leaves in the rosettes is physically constrained because wide-leafed plants can {{only have a few}} blades.

The most important differences between species related to differences in radiation <b>interception,</b> radiation-use <b>efficiency</b> (RUE), N-accumulation efficiency and the partitioning of N to plant parts. During early growth, soybean intercepted more radiation than the other species, primarily because of its greater leaf area index (LAI). Sesbania had the highest RUE (1. 08 g MJ) followed by phasey bean (0. 94 g MJ), soybean (0. 89 g MJ) and vigna (0. 77 g MJ). The efficiency of N-accumulation was greater in soybean (0. 028 g N g) and phasey bean (0. 030 g N g) than in vigna (0. 022 g N g) and sesbania (0. 021 g N g). In all species, the proportion of N allocated to leaves declined throughout the experimental period, being more rapid in soybean than in sesbania and phasey bean. Despite this decline in total N partitioned to the leaves, both soybean and phasey bean maintained a relatively stable specific leaf nitrogen (SPLN) throughout the experimental periods although sesbania and vigna displayed rapid decreases in SPLN. The large variation between species in RUE and N-accumulation efficiency indicates that the development of ley legume cultivars with a combination of traits for more efficient legume production, water use and soil N-accumulation in the water-limited environments of the grain belt of eastern Australia may be possible.

Intercepted light was estimated by coupling an architectural model and a light model for different genotypes of the rosette species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh and a sunflower crop. The model was applied to plants of contrasting architectures, cultivated in isolation or in canopy, in natural or artificial environments, and under contrasting light conditions. The model gave satisfactory results when compared with observed data and enabled calculation of light interception in situations where direct measurements or classical methods were inefficient, such as young crops, isolated plants or artificial conditions. Furthermore, the model revealed that A. thaliana increased its light <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency</b> when shaded. To conclude, the method can be used to calculate intercepted light at organ, plant and plot levels, in natural and artificial environments, and should be useful in the investigation of genotype-environment interactions for plant architecture and light <b>interception</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This paper originates from a presentation at the 5 th International Workshop on Functional–Structural Plant Models, Napier, New Zealand, November 2007...|$|E

40|$|Estimation of leaf area is an {{essential}} component of plant growth analysis and evapotranspirational studies. Leaf area is important for crop light interception and therefore has a large influence on growth (Boote et al., 1988), transpiration (Enoch and Hurd, 1979) and growth rate (Leith et al., 1986). Leaf area production is essential for energy transference and dry matter accumulation processes in crop canopies. It is also useful in the analysis of canopy architecture as it allows determination of leaf area index, which is important for light <b>interception,</b> radiation use <b>efficiency,</b> plant growth, etc. However, measurement of leaf area of all the leaves of any single plant is not only time consuming but also involves a large amount of labour. But, one cannot do away without measuring leaf area because estimation of leaf area is {{an essential}} part of plant growth analysis. Although many methods are available for leaf area measurements, the use of leaf area as a variable in plant growth analysis and physiological studies is limited owing to the time consuming and laborious methods involved in its measurement and though sophisticated electronic instruments provide accurate and fast leaf area measurement, is expensive especially in developing countries.

Different models were interfaced to estimate (i) the amount of light reaching each plant from hemispherical images, (ii) light intercepted by each plant via a functional-structural plant model, (iii) RUE, as the ratio of plant biomass to intercepted light. The inputs of these models were leaf area, biomass and architecture estimated from plant images and environmental data collected with a precise spatial and temporal resolution. We have tested this method by comparing two experiments performed in autumn and winter/spring. Biomass and leaf area differed between experiments showing a high G×E interaction. Difference in biomass between experiments was entirely {{accounted for by the}} difference in intercepted light. Hence, the mean RUE was common to both experiments and genotypes ranked similarly. The methods presented here allowed dissecting the differences between experiments into (i) genotypic traits that did not differ between experiments but had a high genetic variability, namely plant architecture and RUE (ii) environmental differences, essentially incident light, that affected both biomass and leaf area, (iii) plant traits that differed between experiments due to environmental variables, in particular leaf growth...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Forests {{strongly}} {{influence the}} amount and duration mountain snow storage because forest cover modifies both snow accumulation and ablation processes. Quantifying and predicting forest effects on snow processes and snow storage is critical for understanding the effects of forest change on snow storage, and subsequent impacts on downstream water resources. However, both the magnitude and direction of forest modifications of individual snow processes vary with climate, topography, and forest characteristics. Accurate prediction of the net effects of forest change on mountain snow storage, particularly in a warming climate, depends on accurately representing the spatiotemporal variability of forest-snow interactions. With a goal to better understand forest-snow processes in the maritime snow zone, we collected snow observations over four winters within diverse forest types in western Washington, USA. We utilize these new observations to quantify forest effects on snow duration, {{as well as to}} assess the robustness of remote methods to observe snow-covered area within a forest. We find that mean snow duration is 8 days longer in forest gaps than in forested plots, but that snow duration in thinned forest and dense forest are indistinguishable at the 1600 m 2 plot-scale. We additionally show that time-lapse cameras and spatially distributed ground temperature sensors are both robust methods for observing snow duration, and make suggestions about the optimal spatial density of snow observations within forests. The entire four-year dataset and related metadata are extensively described, and are now publicly available for potential use in numerous modeling applications. To expand our focus on forest-snow interactions to the Pacific Northwest, USA, regional-scale, we collaborate with other research institutions and engage citizen scientists. Regional synthesis and analysis of snow depth and duration at 12 out of 14 paired open-forest locations show that differential snow duration ranges from synchronous, to snow lasting up to 13 weeks longer in the open. The differences in snow duration are attributed to forest effects on snow accumulation, with larger differences between snow accumulation rates than between ablation rates in the open and forested sites through the duration of the forest snowpack. In 2 out of the 14 locations, differential snow duration is 2 - 5 weeks longer in the forest. These 2 sites are subject to hourly average wind speeds ranging up to 8 and 17 m s- 1. Therefore, longer snow duration in the forest likely results from a combination of enhanced deposition of snow and reduced snow loss from canopy interception in the forested sites. These findings suggest that a regional framework to understand forest effects on snow storage in the maritime to maritime-continental transitional climate across the Pacific Northwest must account for high <b>interception</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in warmer climates as well a high winds due to topographic exposure and climate. Lastly, we assess the influence of forest structural characteristics on snow storage in western Washington by linking lidar-derived forest canopy metrics to snow depth and snow duration. By using a matrix decomposition method to collapse the variance of spatially distributed observations of snow depth onto a few dominant modes, we show that the top two modes represent forest effects on snow accumulation and ablation, respectively. Furthermore, gridded metrics of canopy cover and height that quantify the canopy directly overhead, rather than to the south, correlate equally strongly (r 2 of up to 0. 74) with the spatial coefficients that scale both of these modes. This finding suggests that the role of forests in shading the snowpack from sunlight is diminished at this site. Furthermore, multivariate analysis of physiographic predictors of snow duration across a range of elevations and years quantifies the important role of canopy characteristics in controlling snow duration. At the study site in western Washington, the binary simplification of considering forested versus open locations is supported by evidence for a stepped response, in which snow duration shifts from longer to shorter around values of 60 - 70 % canopy cover. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that forest effects on snow accumulation dominate the overall influence of forest on snow storage in the Pacific Northwest, USA, resulting in larger magnitude and longer duration snow storage in canopy gaps, except in locations subject to high wind speeds...|$|R
