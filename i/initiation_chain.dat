50|$|In {{the radical}} {{polymerization}} of ethylene, its π bond is broken, {{and the two}} electrons rearrange {{to create a new}} propagating center like the one that attacked it. The form this propagating center takes depends on the specific type of addition mechanism. There are several mechanisms through which this can be initiated. The free radical mechanism {{is one of the first}} methods to be used. Free radicals are very reactive atoms or molecules that have unpaired electrons. Taking the polymerization of ethylene as an example, the free radical mechanism can be divided into three stages: chain <b>initiation,</b> <b>chain</b> propagation, and chain termination.|$|E

Martinists generally believe that to be an authentic initiate, one {{must be able to}} show a chain of Initiatic Succession which goes back to Saint-Martin himself. However, Restivo states that [...] "Martinist authenticity is not contingent upon acceptance or initiation into a filiation or succession of other Martinists as no personal <b>initiation</b> <b>chain</b> from Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin exists in the sacramental manner of ordination as culmination of mastery in an Initiatic order." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ionic {{polymerization}} {{in which}} the active centers are anions.Note 1: The anions may be free, paired, or aggregated.Modified from the earlier definition. Penczek S.; Moad, G. Pure Appl. Chem., Anionic addition polymerization {{is a form of}} chain-growth polymerization or addition polymerization that involves the polymerization of vinyl monomers with strong electronegative groups. This polymerization is carried out through a carbanion active species. Like all chain-growth polymerizations, it takes place in three steps: chain <b>initiation,</b> <b>chain</b> propagation, and chain termination. Living polymerizations, which lack a formal termination pathway, occur in many anionic addition polymerizations. The advantage of living anionic addition polymerizations is that they allow for the control of structure and composition.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the free}} radical nature of certain polymerizations was determined, certain {{monomers}} were observed to polymerize {{when exposed to}} light. The first to demonstrate the photoinduced free radical chain reaction of vinyl bromide was Ivan Ostromislensky, a Russian chemist who also studied the polymerization of synthetic rubber. Subsequently, many compounds were found to become dissociated by light and found immediate use as photoinitiators in the polymerization industry. In the free radical mechanism of radiation curable systems light absorbed by a photoinitiator generates free-radicals which induce cross-linking reactions of a mixture of functionalized oligomers and monomers to generate the cured film [...] Photocurable materials that form through the free-radical mechanism undergo chain-growth polymerization, which includes three basic steps: <b>initiation,</b> <b>chain</b> propagation, and chain termination. The three steps are depicted in the scheme below, where R• represents the radical that forms upon interaction with radiation during initiation, and M is a monomer. [...] The active monomer that is formed is then propagated to create growing polymeric chain radicals. In photocurable materials the propagation step involves reactions of the chain radicals with reactive double bonds of the prepolymers or oligomers. The termination reaction usually proceeds through combination, in which two chain radicals are joined together, or through disproportionation, which occurs when an atom (typically hydrogen) is transferred from one radical chain to another resulting in two polymeric chains.|$|E

The role of this modification in (hmtRNAMetCAU) for the decoding of AUA, as well as AUG, in both the peptidyl- and aminoacyl-sites of the ribosome in either <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> or <b>chain</b> elongation is still unknown. We report the first synthesis and analyses of the tRNA's anticodon stem and loop domain containing the 5 -formylcytidine modification.

40|$|Poly-ubiquitylation is {{a common}} post-translational {{modification}} that can impart various functions to a target protein. Several distinct mechanisms have been reported for the assembly of poly-ubiquitin chains, involving either stepwise transfer of ubiquitin monomers or attachment of a preformed poly-ubiquitin chain and requiring either {{a single pair of}} ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E 2) and ubiquitin ligase (E 3), or alternatively combinations of different E 2 s and E 3 s. We have analysed the mechanism of poly-ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA by two cooperating E 2 –E 3 pairs, Rad 6 –Rad 18 and Ubc 13 –Mms 2 –Rad 5. We find that the two complexes act sequentially and independently in chain initiation and stepwise elongation, respectively. While loading of PCNA onto DNA is essential for recognition by Rad 6 –Rad 18, chain extension by Ubc 13 –Mms 2 –Rad 5 is only slightly enhanced by loading. Moreover, in contrast to <b>initiation,</b> <b>chain</b> extension is tolerant to variations in the attachment site of the proximal ubiquitin moiety. Our results provide information about a unique conjugation mechanism that appears to be specialised for a regulatable pattern of dual modification...|$|E
40|$|In trimethoprim-inhibited RCstr {{strains of}} Escherichia coli, the {{expression}} of the RC control of stable RNA synthesis arose primarily from a decrease in the intracellular concentrations of glycine and methionine, and not from inhibition of the initiation of new protein chains. In non-supplemented cultures, experiments with rifampicin showed that the immediate response to the addition of trimethoprim was a rapid decrease in the rate of <b>initiation</b> of RNA <b>chains.</b> This was followed after a few minutes by a sufficiently large fall in the rate of endogenous synthesis of nucleotide bases to cause a decrease in the rate of RNA chain polymerization. Inhibition of RNA <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> was thus overridden by an accumulation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases upon the cistrons. RCrel strains also accumulated polymerases upon the DNA in similar circumstances, but did not suffer the initial effects on <b>chain</b> <b>initiation.</b> If purines were supplied before adding trimethoprim, RCstr strains polymerized RNA chains at normal rates, but initiation rates were permanently decreased. In either situation, an increased% of the RNA formed was mRNA. However, in RCrel strains supplemented with bases, trimethoprim did not affect either the rate of <b>initiation</b> of new <b>chains</b> or their rates of polymerization or the relative rates of synthesis of stable RNA and mRNA. Protein synthesis was also severely inhibited by trimethoprim. Though the addition of glycine and methionine to base-supplemented, trimethoprim-inhibited RCstr strains did not apparently affect the decreased rate of protein synthesis, RNA accumulation resumed at its normal rate. Thus, the inhibition of protein <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> had no effect on the rate of RNA accumulation in either RCstr or RCrel bacteria. The RC control does not express itself through inhibitions of protein synthesis at this level...|$|R

50|$|When radical {{reactions}} {{are part of}} organic synthesis the radicals are often generated from radical initiators such as peroxides or azobis compounds. Many radical {{reactions are}} chain reactions with a <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> step, a <b>chain</b> propagation step and a chain termination step. Reaction inhibitors slow down a radical reaction and radical disproportionation is a competing reaction. Radical reactions occur frequently in the gas phase, are often initiated by light, are rarely acid or base catalyzed and are not dependent on polarity of the reaction medium.

40|$|SummaryHedamycin is an {{antitumor}} polyketide antibiotic {{with unusual}} biosynthetic features. Earlier sequence {{analysis of the}} hedamycin biosynthetic gene cluster implied a role for type I and type II polyketide synthases (PKSs). We demonstrate that the hedamycin minimal PKS can synthesize a dodecaketide backbone. The ketosynthase (KS) subunit of this PKS has specificity for both type I and type II acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) with which it collaborates during <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> and <b>chain</b> elongation, respectively. The KS receives a C 6 primer unit from the terminal ACP domain of HedU (a type I PKS protein) directly and subsequently interacts with the ACP domain of HedE (a type II PKS protein) {{during the process of}} chain elongation. HedE is a bifunctional protein with both ACP and aromatase activity. Its aromatase domain can modulate the chain length specificity of the minimal PKS. Chain length can also be influenced by HedA, the C- 9 ketoreductase. While co-expression of the hedamycin minimal PKS and a chain-initiation module from the R 1128 PKS yields an isobutyryl-primed decaketide, the orthologous PKS subunits from the hedamycin gene cluster itself are unable to prime the minimal PKS with a nonacetyl starter unit. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> and elongation by type II PKSs...|$|R
40|$|Vanadate {{inhibits}} protein <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The {{evidence that}} supports {{this conclusion is}} as follows: (i) the biphasic kinetics of inhibition in which protein synthesis is maintained at the control rate for 1 - 2 min is followed by an abrupt decline {{in the rate of}} synthesis; (ii) inhibition is associated with a marked disaggregation of polyribosomes and a concomitant increase in 80 S ribosomes; and (iii) vanadate concentrations that inhibit protein <b>chain</b> <b>initiation</b> do not inhibit polypeptide chain elongation or the aminoacylation of tRNA. In partial reactions of protein <b>chain</b> <b>initiation,</b> vanadate concentrations that inhibit protein synthesis have no detectable effect on the formation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF- 2 -promoted ternary complex with Met-tRNAf and GTP and on the assembly of 40 S ribosomal subunit-Met-tRNAf complexes. On the addition of mRNA, the 40 S ribosomal subunit-Met-tRNAf complexes also are transformed into 80 S ribosome-mRNA-Met-tRNAf complexes, termed 80 S initiation complexes. In vanadate-treated samples, however, these 80 S initiation complexes are defective and unable to proceed beyond this step...|$|R

The 50 % inhibitory concentration of DuP 721 for protein synthesis was 3. 8 micrograms/ml, but it was greater than 64 micrograms/ml for RNA and DNA syntheses.
