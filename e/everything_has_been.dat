50|$|Thirteen:13's debut album, Deny <b>Everything,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> fully {{recorded}} {{by the time the}} band split but was never released.

25|$|Linden Lab pursues {{the use of}} open {{standards}} technologies, {{and uses}} free and open source software such as Apache, MySQL, Squid and Linux. The plan is to move everything to open standards by standardizing the Second Life protocol. Cory Ondrejka, former CTO of Second Life, stated in 2006 that a while after <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> standardized, both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{presence}} of burrowing owls conflicts with development interests, a passive relocation technique has been applied successfully: rather than capturing the birds and transporting them to a new site (which may be stressful and prone to failure), the owls are half-coerced, half-enticed to move on their own accord. The preparations need to start several {{months prior to the}} anticipated disturbance with observing the owl colony and noting especially their local movements and site preferences. After choosing a location nearby that has suitable ground and provides good burrowing owl breeding habitat, this new site is enhanced by adding burrows, perches, etc. Once the owls have accustomed to the changes and are found to be interested in the location – if possible, this should be at the onset of spring, before the breeding season starts – they are prevented from entering the old burrows. A simple one-way trapdoor design has been described that is placed over the burrow for this purpose. If <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> correctly prepared, the owl colony will move over to the new site {{in the course of a}} few nights at most. It will need to be monitored occasionally for the following months or until the major human construction nearby has ended.|$|E

"Being judged {{before you}} today stands {{a nation that}} has been {{deprived}} of everything that is dear and sacred to it from its emergence in its own land – the graves of its patriarchs, the graves of its great kings, the graves of its holy prophets and, above all, the site of its glorious Temple. <b>Everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> taken from it and of all the witnesses to its sanctity, only one vestige remains – one side of a tiny portion of a wall, which, on one side, borders the place of its former Temple. In front of this bare stone wall, that nation stands under the open sky, in the heat of summer and in the rains of winter, and pours out its heart to its God in heaven." ...|$|E

500|$|Catherine Black {{has found}} Dickerson's {{biological}} mother, a Mrs. Dechant (Lynda Boyd). Having given Dickerson {{up for adoption}} as a teenager, she is now a suburban housewife. Dickerson had tried several years previously to reconnect with her, though she {{wanted nothing to do}} with him. Catherine asks her for help, and she begrudgingly agrees to see her son. She recoils when he hugs her, blaming the government for making him what he is. Rejected, Dickerson confesses to the murders. Connor is able to see all of this, his connection to it not yet uncovered. Frank Black is unconvinced that <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> wrapped up, and realizes that Connor is involved—he wants Dickerson to himself. [...] "Stop looking" [...] was his message to Dickerson, to stop looking for affection anywhere else.|$|E
500|$|The Dykeenies' musical {{style has}} been noted {{primarily}} as indie rock, with influences including The Cribs, Bloc Party and The Futureheads. Their musical style has also been compared to art rock and, more prominently, art pop. God Is in the TV Zine described [...] "New Ideas" [...] as sounding [...] "like the first few tracks of Silent Alarm", as well as comparing [...] "Will It Happen Tonight?" [...] to We Are Scientists. Dykeenies have also stated that David Bowie is a major influence of the band, releasing a cover version of Starman {{as part of their}} Live at the Apple Store, Glasgow EP. One particular live review even linked the band to the short-lived [...] "New Rave" [...] genre, as well as comparing lead singer Brian Henderson's vocals to that of Brian Molko. Nothing Means <b>Everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noted as being a more mature pop album, with [...] "The Panic" [...] in particular noted as having dark lyrical content.|$|E
2500|$|Papoose has {{described}} the album as a [...] "New York style album". The album according to Papoose details his struggle and is his life story. Some of the concepts of songs on the album date back to his {{time when he was}} with Jive, but all records have been updated and <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> remixed and remastered and changed around. The album will contain 20 tracks with two skits. The track list was revealed on February 23, 2013.|$|E

2500|$|American goods, {{exactly like}} the great Israeli goods, are {{forbidden}}. It is also forbidden to advertise these goods, even though {{in many cases they}} prove to be superior. America today is a second Israel. It totally supports the Zionist entity. The usurper could not do this without the support of America. [...] "Israel’s" [...] unjustified destruction and vandalism of <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> using American money, American weapons, and the American veto. America has done this for decades without suffering the consequences of any punishment or protests about their oppressive and prejudiced position from the Islamic world.|$|E
2500|$|Romário {{announced}} on 15 April 2008 at his DVD launch {{that he would}} retire from the game of football. He cited his weight as {{a major factor in}} his decision to retire from the game. Romário played for many clubs that spanned across five continents for over two decades. He scored 71 goals in 85 appearances for Brazil (including appearances and goals in the Olympics) and claimed to have scored over 1,000 club goals.

2500|$|Grande's {{music is}} {{generally}} pop and R, {{although it has}} elements of funk, dance and hip hop. Grande said she grew up mainly listening to urban pop and 90s music. Grande's debut album, Yours Truly was complimented for recreating the R [...] "vibe and feel of the 90s" [...] {{with the help of}} songwriter and producer Babyface. The follow-up, My <b>Everything,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as an evolution from her first album with a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres. The Los Angeles Times review of her third album, Dangerous Woman, commented that it is [...] "impressive how fully she inhabits the emotional environment of each song here, even when one directly contradicts another. ... She's ... deft [...] adapting to different styles".|$|E

2500|$|Sontag {{writes that}} the {{convenience}} of modern photography has created an overabundance of visual material, and [...] "just about <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> photographed". This has altered our expectations {{of what we have}} the right to view, want to view or should view. [...] "In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what {{we have the right to}} observe" [...] and has changed our [...] "viewing ethics". Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them.|$|E
