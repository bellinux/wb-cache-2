25|$|Although {{still an}} {{important}} industrial city, Hopewell {{has struggled with}} transitions through loss of jobs due to plant closures, changes in residential housing patterns, {{and the costs of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>clean-up.</b> Much of its middle class population moved to neighboring Prince George and Chesterfield Counties for newer housing during the suburban expansion of the 1960s and 1970s. The city's housing stock is dominated by relatively small homes with a significant percentage being offered as rental properties. Of these, many were hastily constructed over a century ago by DuPont to house plant workers during the First World War.|$|E

2500|$|Suri and Chapman {{argue that}} a net {{pollution}} reduction may not actually be occurring on global scales. Wealthy nations have a trend of exporting the activities that create the most pollution, like manufacturing of clothing and furniture, to poorer nations that {{are still in the}} process of industrial development (Suri and Chapman, 1998). This could mean that as the world's poor nations develop, they will have nowhere to export their pollution. Thus, this progression of environmental clean up occurring in conjunction with economic growth cannot be replicated indefinitely because there may be nowhere to export waste and pollution intensive processes. However, Gene Grossman and Alan B. Krueger, the authors who initially made the correlation between economic growth, <b>environmental</b> <b>clean-up,</b> and the Kuznets curve, conclude that there is [...] "no evidence that environmental quality deteriorates steadily with economic growth." [...] And Yandle et al. conclude that [...] "policies that stimulate growth (trade liberalization, economic restructuring, and price reform) should be good for the environment".|$|E

500|$|To {{assist with}} river cleanup and the {{associated}} funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor John Delaney of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an American Heritage River, beginning in 1997. The designation by the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to coordinate efforts among federal agencies to improve natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation. The campaign was controversial as the Republican mayor defended asking for federal government assistance, writing [...] "Other rivers have relied heavily on federal help for massive <b>environmental</b> <b>clean-ups.</b> It's the St. Johns' turn now." [...] Twenty-two towns along the St. Johns and environmental, sporting, recreation, boating, and educational organizations also supported its designation, but several prominent Republican politicians expressed concerns over increased federal regulations and restrictions on private property ownership along the river; the Florida House of Representatives passed a resolution asking President Bill Clinton not to include the St. Johns. Despite this, Clinton designated the St. Johns as one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers out of 126 nominated in 1998 for its ecological, historic, economic and cultural significance.|$|R
