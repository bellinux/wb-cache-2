500|$|Speculation about Dempsey's {{exit from}} Grey's Anatomy began in November, when Dempsey casually {{mentioned}} {{during an interview}} that he might be leaving the series very soon. Despite signing on for two more years {{at the end of the}} tenth season of the show, he disclosed that the eleventh season would be his last. The announcement was made public on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of [...] "How to Save a Life". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained how the decision could have been made when he had just renewed his contract as he asserted on the natural developments leading up to his exit from the long-running series. He said, [...] "It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded, and it just naturally came to be. Which was pretty good. I like the way it has all played out." [...] He went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, as he said, [...] "Things happened very quickly, where we were like, Oh this is where it’s going to go. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> unfolded in a very organic way."

Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} not about the real life [...] "Son of Sam", serial killer David Berkowitz. Smith explained, [...] "It's not about the serial killer.

There are some {{destructive}} figures in it, 'Son of Sam', Shiva... but Shiva's also associated with creativity...

5000|$|As {{revealed}} on {{an episode}} of Live From The Bluebird Cafe, the song is a semi-autobiographical account of a period when the song's writer, Matraca Berg, lived in Louisiana and became homesick for Nashville shortly thereafter. Gary Harrison said that [...] "that song broke {{every one of those}} hard-and-fast rules that Nashville was still adhering to at the time.
