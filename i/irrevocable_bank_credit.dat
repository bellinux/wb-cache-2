40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> channel of monetary {{policy in the}} Philippines by adding and respecifying a dynamic, structural, economy-wide macro econometric model. The main {{question is whether the}} credit channel matters in transmitting impulses to the real economy in the Philippines. The evidence on the <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> channel is obtained by estimating changes in <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> that take into account not only the monetary policy indicators, but specific banking indicators to monetary policy actions, such as bank capital. Simulation results suggest that <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> channel matters in Philippine monetary transmission mechanism. The total demand impact of changes in <b>bank</b> <b>credit</b> is the sum of various effects in the money supply, Treasury bill and lending rates, personal consumption and investment, all of which have significant impact on aggregate demand. However, the impact of a monetary policy tightening on output appears to be relatively moderate and quite long. Meanwhile, the impact on the price level appears to be stronger and shorter compared to the impact on output. In addition, bank capital is found to have significant effects on <b>bank</b> <b>credit,</b> implying that it could potentially be a key determinant of monetary policy transmission.

This paper tests this and other predictions of the Burkart and Ellingsen model using a large sample of more than 28, 000 Canadian firms. The author uses an endogenous method to divide the firms into the appropriate wealth categories rather than arbitrarily selecting firms likely to be credit-rationed. The data support the main predictions of the model quite well.
