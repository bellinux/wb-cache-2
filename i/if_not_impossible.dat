5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{lost the}} {{governorship}} that fall, and in 1856 the Democrats {{combined with the}} remaining Whigs {{in the state legislature}} to repeal the Maine law entirely. Some of the other states that had passed Maine laws followed suit as they learned that the promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b> Dow continued to travel the country (and the United Kingdom) speaking in support of prohibition, but to little legislative effect. Maine passed a new, much milder Maine law in 1858, which Dow disliked but defended as better than nothing.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wael Haddara, {{president}} of the Muslim Association of Canada, said that he [...] "respects" [...] Fatah for his passion {{but that it was}} [...] "hard, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> downright <b>impossible,</b> to find something positive that he has ever said about Muslims." [...] As a result, Haddara argues, Muslims are no longer listening to Fatah.|$|R
5000|$|Sultan-Zade {{was removed}} from the {{leadership}} of the Persian Communist Party in 1932 and later expelled. He returned to work in the Soviet economic apparatus following his cashiering by the Persian party. According to a 1984 journal article by his biographer, Sultan-Zade's activities after this date become [...] "difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> completely <b>impossible,</b> to trace." ...|$|R
30|$|As a swift {{commercialisation}} {{of actual}} biotechnology drugs {{is very difficult}} <b>if</b> <b>not</b> even <b>impossible,</b> {{for a number of}} companies this meant orienting major parts of their research operations to developing a research technology product to be sold to other companies and academic research. Having such a product in turn could generate financial resources to do other kinds of research and development work.|$|R
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to deduce.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} {{like that of a}} human (being {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated iliac blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee from the hip. This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion. Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to grasp branches with the hindlimbs. Besides locomotion, A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E
40|$|In {{the mobile}} cloud (e. g. {{vehicular}} cloud), users collabo-rate and share images amongst different screen sizes. Simi-lar images {{do not share}} overlapping blocks, thus deduplica-tion is difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> near <b>impossible</b> even when two images are slightly similar. In this paper, we present a method to achieve linearly scalable deduplication storage and dissemi-nation for photos shared within the cloud...|$|R
60|$|Anderson Rover {{heaved a}} deep sigh, which was echoed by his sons. To get down into that mass of rocks a {{distance}} of from one to two hundred feet would surely be a herculean task, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> an <b>impossible</b> one. And then, too, there was a question {{whether or not the}} treasure had not dropped down through some hole {{in the bottom of the}} cave after the earthquake.|$|R
500|$|On 9 June 1961, {{a second}} USAF/NASA flight {{evaluation}} of the Avrocar {{was conducted on the}} similarly modified second prototype at the Avro facility. During these tests, the vehicle reached a maximum speed of [...] and showed the ability to traverse a ditch six feet across and [...] deep. Flight above the critical altitude proved dangerous <b>if</b> <b>not</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> due to inherent instability. The flight test report further identified a range of control problems.|$|R
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E
5|$|Crispi was {{replaced}} {{as prime minister}} by Antonio Di Rudinì in February 1891, who was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti in May 1892. On January 20, 1893, when peasants of Caltavuturo occupied communal land that they claimed was theirs, local authorities killed 13 and wounded 21 in the Caltavuturo massacre. Disturbances continued throughout the year. The Fasci started out as urban movements, animated by artisans, which evolved into a more popular and combative mass movement with the adherence of sulphur miners, and in a later stage with the involvement of peasants and sharecroppers. In the autumn of 1893, labour conflicts in the cities and the mines came together with the protests and claims of the farmers. The movement reached its greatest breadth in the manifestations against taxes, involving the lowest tiers {{of the city and}} the countryside, becoming difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> to control by its leaders.|$|E
5|$|Hitler gave Rommel {{command of}} the newly re-formed Army Group B, which {{included}} the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions. Recognizing that Allied air superiority would make it difficult <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> to move reserves into position once the invasion was underway, Rommel decided to concentrate the defences along the coast. The 716th Infantry Division, which had been stationed in the area since March 1942, was significantly understrength, with only 6,000 men. This unit received reinforcements, {{and some of the}} older men were replaced by younger soldiers. It was also supplemented by several battalions of Osttruppen (eastern soldiers), conscripted Soviet prisoners of war. The 352nd Infantry Division, a full-strength unit of around 12,000, was brought into the area by Rommel on 15 March and reinforced by two additional regiments. About 2,000 men, a mixture from the two infantry divisions, were stationed in the coastal area between Arromanches and Asnelles.|$|E

50|$|For a {{deterministic}} language, if one {{is given}} {{the current state of}} a program, the next state can always be predicted. This is not true for a nondeterministic language. Most languages are deterministic, but some languages, such as Befunge, supply a built-in randomization instruction. Moreover, languages such as Java2k have only randomized instructions. Thus, getting even trivial programs to have a reliable output is often a monumental, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> outright <b>impossible,</b> task.|$|R
50|$|Judge Aiken began {{trying the}} arrested protesters on June 17. His {{handling}} of the cases of those arrested has received criticism from several people and {{organizations such as the}} United States Department of Justice. During the trials Aiken refused to give out bills of particulars or grant continuances or bail. He also announced guilty verdicts from a pre-typed script and made it nearly, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> completely, <b>impossible</b> for the defendants to appeal their sentences.|$|R
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible</b> on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
25|$|Estimates for {{the extent}} of search {{behavior}} by adoptees have proven elusive; studies show significant variation. In part, the problem stems from the small adoptee population which makes random surveying difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Applying {{standard}} diffraction {{techniques to}} crystal powders or polycrystals {{is tantamount to}} collapsing the 3D reciprocal space, as obtained via single-crystal diffraction, onto a 1D axis. The resulting partial-to-total overlap of symmetry-independent reflections renders the structure determination process more difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite their {{distinct}} working {{styles and}} preferences, {{it is very}} difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> altogether <b>impossible,</b> to ascribe most of their songs to only one of them. In most of the songs, they invariably contributed to one another's creation, either {{in the form of}} improvisation of tune or of orchestration, thus, making their compositions truly a joint effort. Furthermore, each of the two could compose in other's style now and then thereby making the identification still more difficult.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 1961, {{a second}} USAF/NASA flight {{evaluation}} of the Avrocar {{was conducted on the}} similarly modified second prototype at the Avro facility.

25|$|NST's C-G {{range is}} wider, both lower and higher, than the E-E range of {{standard}} tuning {{in which the}} strings are tuned to the opennotes E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4.

25|$|Because most MKUltra {{records were}} {{deliberately}} destroyed in 1973 {{by order of}} then CIA director Richard Helms, it has been difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> for investigators to gain a complete understanding {{of the more than}} 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MKUltra and related CIA programs.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{empirical}} phenomena {{are considered}} continuously variable, meaning that social developments have no parameters or constants, only variables, {{which makes it}} very difficult, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>impossible,</b> to extract historical laws or make predictions.

50|$|The European Boxing Union {{went through}} a period of {{economical}} difficulties during World War II.
