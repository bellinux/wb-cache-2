5|$|Gamma decay: {{this process}} {{results from a}} change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, {{resulting}} in the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{man-made}} {{sources of}} thallium pollution include gaseous <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> cement factories, coal burning power plants, and metal sewers. The {{main source of}} elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see.

5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to}} have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> light by a living organism. It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
30|$|The GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> 51.6  g CO 2 e/MJ for the {{synthetic}} diesel fuel {{are less than}} that for petroleum diesel fuel (52.8  g CO 2 e/MJ), since {{the synthetic}} diesel fuel provides improved fuel economy and reduced <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and CH 4 compared to petroleum diesel. The reduction in GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> 52.8 and 52.6  g CO 2 e/MJ for petroleum diesel, using the 20 - and 100 -year lifetime models, respectively, is nearly the same, since the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> CH 4 from diesel vehicles are small compared to CO 2 emissions.|$|R

5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emission</b> <b>of</b> {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} coal property and stove efficiency on the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAHs) and oxygenated PAHs (oPAHs) during the combustion, fifteen coal/stove combinations were tested in this study, including five coals of different geological maturities in briquette and chunk forms burned in two residential stoves. The <b>emission</b> factors (EFs) <b>of</b> pPAHs and oPAHs were {{in the range of}} 0. 129 - 16. 7 mg/kg and 0. 059 - 0. 882 mg/kg, respectively. The geological maturity of coal significantly affected the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> pPAHs and oPAHs with the lower maturity coals yielding the higher emissions. The chunk-to-briquette transformation of coal dramatically increased the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> pPAHs and oPAHs during the combustion of anthracite, whereas this transformation only elevated the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> high molecular weight PAHs for bituminous coals. The influence of stove type on the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> pPAHs and oPAHs was also geological-maturity-dependent. High efficiency stove significantly reduced the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> PAHs from those relatively high-maturity coals, but its influences on low-maturity coals were inconstant.
