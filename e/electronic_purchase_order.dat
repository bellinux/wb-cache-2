50|$|There {{are lots}} of names/terms for <b>Electronic</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Orders.</b> It is {{sometimes}} known as: E-Procurement, E-Purchasing, E-Purchase Requisition. These terms are normally all referring to <b>Electronic</b> <b>Purchase</b> <b>Orders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> are {{no longer}} paper-based, but rather {{transmitted}} electronically over the Internet. It is common for <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> {{to be used to}} buy goods or services of any type online.|$|R
5000|$|Ordernet was {{an early}} {{e-commerce}} initiative that provided <b>electronic</b> interchange of <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> and associated business documents between manufacturers and distributors. In particular, it was set up as a service bureau that would provide a solution to distributors looking to handle business-to-business transactions. [...] In 1975 Informatics had arranged with the National Wholesale Druggists’ Association to create a central clearinghouse for the processing of <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> within the industry. [...] In 1978 that association formally endorsed the use of Ordernet, which led Informatics to create an Ordernet Services Division. [...] As a business unit within Informatics, this division was essentially a one-person effort at the beginning.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve their goals, {{organizations}} collaborate with business partners. Such collaborations represent enactments of inter-organizational business processes and may be supported through the exchange of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) messages (e. g., <b>electronic</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>orders,</b> invoices etc.). For gaining insights on such processes, recently two distinct approaches for enabling the application of process mining techniques on inter-organizational business processes based on the interchanged EDI messages have been proposed: (i) Message Flow Mining (MFM) and (ii) Physical Activity Mining (PAM). In this paper, we present {{a case study in}} which we apply the PAM methodology on a real-world EDI data set obtained from a German manufacturer of consumer goods. Our results demonstrate potential insights that can be gained from applying process mining techniques in the context of inter-organizational business processes...|$|R

50|$|Another {{enterprise}} {{software application}} being leveraged on a mobile platform is procurement. This trend {{is led by}} the consumer shopping experience. Over 36% of online sales on Black Friday in 2015 came from mobile shopping, according to IBM. As more shoppers are migrating to mobile applications, procurement departments need to keep up with user preferences. This mobile platform provides capabilities to complete the procurement process from start to finish. This includes searching for items and services, comparing vendors and prices, submitting purchase requests, approving requests, <b>electronic</b> signing, <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> and invoicing. Being able to accomplish this all in one place from any device significantly streamlines business procurement and operations.|$|R
50|$|Merchant data {{transmitted}} via a value-added network (VAN) was generally formatted as {{electronic data interchange}} (EDI). Online businesses found EDI was too cumbersome to accommodate all the file formats and business rules the growing volume of e-commerce retailers required. CommerceHub developed a web-based approach to serve e-commerce integration needs with their Universal Connection Hub, a translation engine that provides integration to translate and normalize supply chain communications, and enable <b>electronic</b> processing of <b>purchase</b> <b>orders,</b> change orders, and remittance confirmations in native file format. The Universal Connection Hub supports industry communications and file format options including web browser, VPN, VAN, FTP, web services, HTTPS, EDI, XML, flat files, spreadsheets, and others.|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys {{practical}} {{issues in the}} design of a formal language for business communication (FLBC) in which transactions are put together by combining meaningful elements, much as a programming language encodes algorithms. Such a language is preferable to existing codes such as ANSI X 12 and UN EDIFACT because of its much greater versatility. The new language is tentatively named LEC (Language for Electronic Commerce). 1 The problem 1. 1 Why a new language? Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the automated exchange between computers of the messages needed to carry out business transactions. Examples include <b>electronic</b> funds transfers, <b>purchase</b> <b>orders,</b> invoices, and various kinds of administrative information. EDI users range from corporations to armed forces to museums and libraries. Present-day EDI messages look like Figure 1, and I want to make them look like Figure 2.

5000|$|Creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is {{typically}} {{the first step}} of the purchase to pay process in an ERP system. <b>Purchase</b> <b>orders</b> may require a SKU code. Within an ERP system, a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> can be created manually, and may require confirmation or changes via editing. Within an ERP system (such as in SAP), manually creating a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> within the system may look something like [...] "Logistics -> Materials Management -> <b>Purchasing</b> -> <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Order</b> -> Create" [...] and providing a Transaction Code. This document type will be chosen from the screen. A vendor code lookup may need to be selected for a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> steps, as well as things like organization group and company code.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this paper was done in CV. Rooesman, a small scale shoes and bag manufacturer company located in Yogyakarta Indonesia. Their strategy to response the demand is make-to-order. This company receives many <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from several countries such as Japan, South Korea, and USA. Each <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is unique for example in term of design, complexity of the production process and raw material needed. Currently CV. Rooesman has difficulty to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. Ideally, all <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from the customers have to be accepted. However due to the some factors such as limitation of resources that the company have i. e. human resources (number of workers and skill of workers needed) and other factor such as characteristic of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> the company have to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. It {{happened in the past}} that the company accepted the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> without considering those factors then the order was not be able to deliver on time {{and the quality of the}} products did not meet the expectation of the customer. As a result, the company paid the penalty and the products were rejected by the customer. The {{research in}} this paper therefore tries to model <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> selection problem using Analytic Network Process. There are four clusters considered in the model which are: Characteristic of the <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (Design of the Product, Quantity Order, Characteristic of the Customer, and Expected Quality), Complexity of the Production Process (Number of Workers Needed, Ability to Make the Prototype, Manufacturing Lead Time, Skill of the Worker), Economical Value (Production Cost, Selling Price and Price of Raw Material), and Alternative <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> (<b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 1, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 2, <b>Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> 3) ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{a typical}} <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> may not contain {{contract}} language (in fact most contain {{little more than}} a list of the goods or services the buyer desires to purchase, along with price, payment terms, and shipping instructions), the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is a specially regarded instrument regulated by the Uniform Commercial Code or other similar law which establishes a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> as a contract by its nature. Yet despite the nature of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> with a legal document such as the terms & conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.|$|R

50|$|A master-detail {{relationship}} is a one-to-many type relationship. Examples of a master-detail relationship are: {{a set of}} <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> {{and a set of}} line items belonging to each <b>purchase</b> <b>order,</b> an expense report with a set of expense line items or a department with a list of employees belonging to it. An application can use this master-detail relationship to enable users to navigate through the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> data and see the detail data for line items only related to the master <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> selected.|$|R

50|$|The {{record of}} <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> in most {{business}} firms {{are still on}} paper and thus {{there is a need}} for proper <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> format. Many users wish to have professional formatting for <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> for several reasons. A company may wish to have a strong understanding of purchase transactions or to know the basic requirements of <b>purchase</b> <b>order.</b> It may also make it part of business documentation, which makes the process easier while keeping record of all transactions and to have good impression on the client or customer.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} a <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> that moves through various departments for authorization and eventual <b>purchase.</b> The <b>order</b> may be moved from department to department for approval automatically. When all authorizations are obtained, the requester of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is notified {{and given the}} authorization. A workflow process may involve constant change and update. For example, the normal approver of <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> may be on vacation, in which case, the application will request approval from alternate approvers.|$|R

40|$|The Electronic Data Interchange {{over the}} Internet (EDI-INT) {{standards}} provide a secure means of transporting EDI and XML business documents over the Internet. EDI-INT includes different implementation protocols that {{work over the}} Internet’s three major transports — SMTP, HTTP, and FTP. Each uses Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), digital signatures, encryption, and message-receipt validation to ensure the necessary security for business-to-business communications. Numerous retailers, manufacturers,and other companies within busi-ness supply chains are leveraging Applicability Statement # 2 (AS 2) and other standards developed by the IETF’s Electronic Data Interchange over the Internet (EDI-INT) working group (www. imc. org/ietf-ediint/). Founded in 1996 to develop a secure transport service for EDI business documents, the EDI-INT WG later expanded its focus to include XML and virtually any other electronic business-documentation format. It be-gan by providing the digital security and message-receipt validation for In-ternet communication for MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions) packaging of EDI. 1 EDI-INT has since become the leading means of business-to-business (B 2 B) transport for retail and other industries. Although invisible to the consumer, stan-dards for secure <b>electronic</b> communica-tion of <b>purchase</b> <b>orders,</b> invoices, and other business transactions are helping enterprises drive down costs and offer flexibility in B 2 B relationships. EDI-INT provides digital security of email, Web, and FTP payloads through authentication, content-integrity, confidentiality, and re-ceipt validation. History Western Union first demonstrated EDI in the 1850 s with the telegraph, but lack of infrastructure hindered its wider use. By the 1960 s, however, the necessary tech-nology was available to facilitate EDI among business trading partners. As EDI took hold and replaced hardcopy deliv-ery, large companies, such as Sears and General Motors, created their own pro...|$|R
