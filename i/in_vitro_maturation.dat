In vivo and <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> pollen <b>maturations</b> were followed and compared by transmission electron microscopy, and several <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> parameters were tested in terms of carbohydrate physiology. In vivo, pollen maturation was initiated at the vacuolated microspore stage, and consisted of two successive phases. The first phase was characterized by reactivation of microspore organelles, followed by microspore mitosis, starch synthesis and vacuole breakdown. During the second phase, starch was progressively degraded whereas lipid and phytine reserves accumulated. In vivo, pollen maturation occured within 14 days and pollen germination rate was 73. 6 ± 2. 2 %.

40|$|Fatty acid {{oxidation}} is {{an important}} energy source for the oocyte; however, {{little is known about}} how this metabolic pathway is regulated in cumulus-oocyte complexes. Analysis of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation showed that many are regulated by the luteinizing hormone surge during in vivo maturation, including acyl-CoA synthetases, carnitine transporters, acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and acetyl-CoA transferase, but that many are dysregulated when cumulus-oocyte complexes are matured under <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>maturation</b> conditions using follicle stimulating hormone and epidermal growth factor. Fatty acid oxidation, measured as production of 3 H 2 O from [3 H]palmitic acid, occurs in mouse cumulus-oocyte complexes in response to the luteinizing hormone surge but is significantly reduced in cumulus-oocyte complexes matured in vitro. Thus we sought to determine whether fatty acid oxidation in cumulus-oocyte complexes could be modulated during <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>maturation</b> by lipid metabolism regulators, namely peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonists bezafibrate and rosiglitazone. Bezafibrate showed no effect with increasing dose, while rosiglitazone dose dependently inhibited fatty acid oxidation in cumulus-oocyte complexes during <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>maturation.</b> To determine the impact of rosiglitazone on oocyte developmental competence, cumulus-oocyte complexes were treated with rosiglitazone during <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>maturation</b> and gene expression, oocyte mitochondrial activity and embryo development following in vitro fertilization were assessed. Rosiglitazone restored Acsl 1, Cpt 1 b and Acaa 2 levels in cumulus-oocyte complexes and increased oocyte mitochondrial membrane potential yet resulted in significantly fewer embryos reaching the morula and hatching blastocyst stages.

40|$|In this study, porcine embryos were {{produced}} <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> from slaughterhouse sow or gilt oocytes which were matured and fertilized <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and subsequently cultured to the blastocyst stage. <b>In</b> <b>vitro</b> produced blastocysts are of poorer quality than their in vivo counterparts, and {{suffer from a}} high incidence of embryo mortality during culture and foetal mortality after (non-) surgical transfer. The causes of such abnormalities can possibly be ascribed to a number of factors such as the high incidence of polyspermy (oocyte penetration by more than one sperm cell), a reduced number of cells in transfer-stage blastocysts, deviant ratio of inner cell mass (cells giving rise to the foetus) to trophectoderm cells (cell layer developing into the placenta) and a higher incidence of programmed cell death (apoptosis). This study demonstrated that the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> oocyte <b>maturation</b> milieu, is an important determinant of blastocysts quality. Supplementation of oocyte maturation medium with sow follicular fluid, in contrast with gilt follicular fluid, reduced polyspermy and improved the morphological quality of resultant blastocysts, while modulation of hormone levels and addition of oviductal epithelial cells during <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> oocyte <b>maturation</b> increased the total blastocyst cell number. Supplementation of the embryo culture medium with growth hormone improved blastocyst quality by reducing DNA fragmentation (albeit that apoptosis in all was not decreased) and enhancing blastocyst expansion. Growth hormone treatment did not improve pregnancy rates up to day 11 following non-surgical transfer, but all pregnancies resulted from batches of blastocysts which had a larger mean batch diameter.
