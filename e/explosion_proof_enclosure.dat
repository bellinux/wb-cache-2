40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a FUR Systems A 40 M infrared (IR) digital camera for thermal monitoring of a Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Ethanol bi-propellant Reaction Control Engine (RCE) during Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) testing at the National Aeronautics & Space Administration's (NASA) White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Typically, NASA has relied mostly on the use of ThermoCouples (TC) for this type of thermal monitoring due to the variability of constraints required to accurately map rapidly changing temperatures from ambient to glowing hot chamber material. Obtaining accurate real-time temperatures in the JR spectrum is made even more elusive by the changing emissivity of the chamber material as it begins to glow. The parameters evaluated prior to APS testing included: (1) remote operation of the A 40 M camera using fiber optic Firewire signal sender and receiver units; (2) operation of the camera inside a Pelco <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> <b>enclosure</b> with a germanium window; (3) remote analog signal display for real-time monitoring; (4) remote digital data acquisition of the A 40 M's sensor information using FUR's ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2. 8 software; and (5) overall reliability of the system. An initial characterization report was prepared after the A 40 M characterization tests at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to document controlled heat source comparisons to calibrated TCs. Summary IR digital data recorded from WSTF's APS testing is included within this document along with findings, lessons learned, and recommendations for further usage as a monitoring tool for the development of rocket engines...|$|E
50|$|There are {{multiple}} {{ways to make}} equipment explosion-proof, or safe for use in ex-hazardous areas. Intrinsic safety {{is one of a}} few methods available for ex-hazardous areas. Others include <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> <b>enclosures,</b> venting, oil immersion, powder and sand filling, and hermetic sealing. For handheld electronics, intrinsic safety is the only realistic method that allows a functional device to be explosion-proof. A device termed intrinsically safe is designed to be incapable of producing heat or spark sufficient to ignite an explosive atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|In {{the event}} that an entry rescue must be performed, rescue {{personnel}} will wear protective clothing appropriate for the situation. This may include a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), protective headgear {{and the use of}} <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> lighting (to prevent igniting any gases). The rescuer may also wear a full body harness with an attached safety line, especially if a vertical descent is required.

On single alternator circuits, the power may be split between the engine starting battery and the domestic or house battery (or batteries) by use of a split-charge diode (battery isolator) or a voltage-sensitive relay.|$|R
50|$|Low {{temperature}} {{underfloor heating}} {{is embedded in}} the floor or placed under the floor covering. As such it occupies no wall space and creates no burn hazards, nor is it a hazard for physical injuries due to accidental contact leading to tripping and falling. This has been referenced as a positive feature in healthcare facilities including those serving elderly clients and those with dementia. Anecdotally, under similar environmental conditions, heated floors will speed evaporation of wetted floors (showering, cleaning, and spills). Additionally, underfloor heating with fluid filled pipes is useful in heating and cooling <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> environments where combustion and electrical equipment can be located remotely from the explosive environment.|$|R
40|$|Pipe {{systems that}} are used in the process {{industry}} may occasionally be subjected to internal deflagration and detonation waves.

On request of and in corporation with BASF in Ludwigshafen, Germany, the design rules for piping subjected to internal detonations have been reviewed, focusing on two main subjects: the generation and propagation of detonation waves and secondly the response of the piping to the loads imposed by detonation waves. This paper will focus mainly on the last subject, i. e. the response of the piping on the dynamic loads. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

40|$|A {{current to}} {{pressure}} (I/P) transducer {{will be used}} in the D-Zero piping system. The transducer is necessary to precisely control the control valve positioners located at the argon and nitrogen dewars. A 4 - 20 rnA signal will come from the PLC function of the TI 565. This electric signal must be converted by the transducer to a pneumatic signal of 3 - 15 psi which will position the actuator. By doing this, the valve can be opened or closed to any adjusted amount from the control room or a remote I/P controller. A total of 9 transducers will be used at the dewars. The nitrogen dewar will have 3 that are located outside and will have to be weatherproof.

40|$|Due to {{drastic changes}} of the harsh {{environment}} in coal mine, the function of protection system of <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> fan may deteriorate. The fan shows delay or tripping in advance, leading to poor ventilation, temperature increase, and causing gas explosion. To address these problems, a method for dynamic tracking and processing of sampling signal based on embedded processor (Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) architecture) is proposed. The method uses ARM as the control core, taking advantage of its rich resources. With the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and data fusion algorithms, a mathematical model of dynamic tracking on temperature and current signal is constructed, and the double closed-loop monitoring and protection on temperature and current is achieved. Simulation effect: The fan operates stably and reliably under the monitoring by this system. This proves that the method is feasible and effective. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{solving the}} problem of <b>explosion</b> <b>proof</b> in {{measurement}} of thermal gas flow using electronic sensor by presenting {{a new type of}} flow sensor by optical fiber heating. A measuring unit based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for fluid temperature and a unit for heat dissipation are designed to replace the traditional electronic sensors. The light in C band from the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light source is split, with one part used to heat the absorbing coating and the other part used in the signal processing unit. In the heating unit, an absorbing coating is introduced to replace the traditional resistance heating module to minimize the risk of explosion. The measurement results demonstrate a fine consistency between the flow and temperature difference in simulation. The method to enhance the measurement resolution of flow is also discussed...|$|R
