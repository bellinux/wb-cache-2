40|$|OBJETIVO: {{investigar}} a ocorrência de queixas auditivas em <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> da cidade de Recife/PE. MÉTODOS: foi realizada uma entrevista com 30 <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys,</b> com idade entre 19 e 28 anos, abordando informações ocupacionais, conhecimentos gerais sobre o ruído e queixas auditivas (diminuição da acuidade auditiva, desconforto a sons intensos, zumbido, sensação de ouvido abafado e otalgia). A análise foi realizada por meio de abordagem quantitativa, utilizando o teste estatístico t-student. RESULTADOS: dentre os dados mais relevantes, destacam-se: 46, 7 % dos <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> apresentaram, espontaneamente, queixas auditivas, em especial, a diminuição da acuidade auditiva (relatada por todos os sujeitos); 14 <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> (46, 67 %) referiram desconforto a sons intensos e 13 (43, 33 %) mencionaram zumbido. Todos afirmaram ter conhecimento sobre os riscos do ruído para a saúde auditiva, mas 76, 7 % não realizam qualquer medida preventiva de suas consequências. A perda auditiva foi referida pelos sujeitos como o principal risco da exposição a níveis intensos de pressão sonora. CONCLUSÃO: todos os <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> apresentaram queixa de perda auditiva e, entre as demais queixas auditivas, destacaram-se o desconforto a sons intensos e o zumbido. Tendo em vista a irreversibilidade da perda auditiva induzida por elevados níveis de pressão sonora, os <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> devem ser periodicamente avaliados a fim de que se confirme ou não a perda auditiva de que se queixaram e, caso ela exista, deve ser monitorada para que seja passível de intervenção pelo fonoaudiólogo. Desta forma, percebe-se a necessidade de atuação da Fonoaudiologia junto aos <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys,</b> uma vez que poder-se-á propiciar a otimização do exercício profissional com o mínimo de risco possível. PURPOSE: {{to investigate}} the occurrence of auditory complaints in <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> {{from the city of}} Recife/PE. METHODS: an interview was carried through with 30 <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> aged between 19 and 48 years, involving occupational information, general knowledge about noise and auditory complaints (diminished auditory acuity, discomfort under intense sound, tinnitus, sultry ear sensation and otalgia). The analysis was carried out through a quantitative approach and using t-student statistical test. RESULTS: among the most relevant data we can empathize that: 46. 7 % of the <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> showed, spontaneously, auditory complaints, in special, reduction of the auditory acuity (referred by all subjects); 14 <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> (46. 67 %) related to feel discomfort to intense sound and 13 (43. 33 %) mentioned tinnitus. All of them affirmed to know the risks of noise related to auditory health, but 76. 7 % do not apply any prevention against its consequences. Hearing loss was related as the main risk of exposure to high level of sound pressure. CONCLUSIONS: all <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> complained on hearing loss and, among the other auditory complaints, we may emphasize discomfort under intense sound and tinnitus. Considering the irreversibility of high sound pressure induced hearing loss, the <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> might be periodically evaluated as for hearing in order to confirm or discard the hearing loss they complaint. If hearing loss exist, it might be monitored, in order to make possible an intervention by the speech-language therapist. Such being the case, we may perceive the need for speech therapy concerning the <b>disc</b> <b>jockeys</b> for optimizing their professional performance with less risks...|$|R
