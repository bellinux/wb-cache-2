40|$|Due to the {{diminishing}} reserves {{of fossil fuels}} and increased pollution from exploitation of these fuels, the world is focusing on the renewable energy sources. Energy from tidal waves {{is one of the}} most exciting forms of renewable energy because of its consistent nature. Hence, the predictable, consistent and reliable nature of marine currents has enthused the researchers to emphasize on harnessing energy from marine currents in order to meet the renewable energy targets. Exploitation of this technology is underway and further research is required to extract this energy optimally. Operating under water and harnessing kinetic energy has restated the importance of Vertical Axis Marine Current Turbines (VAMCTs). Recent studies have shown that the shape of the blades, within a VAMCT, has an appreciably considerable effect on its performance output. The flow field in the vicinity of the VAMCT is greatly affected by the design and shape of the <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> This paper presents an effort carried out to analyze the effect of the shape of the <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> of a VAMCT on its performance output. VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> has been analyzed and the results have been compared with the existing literature for the performance output from a VAMCT having straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> It has been shown that a VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> performances superiorly as compared to straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades.</b> Furthermore, the operational range of a VAMCT with curved <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> increases significantly as compared to straight <b>stator</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The J79 was {{a brand-new}} engine, with {{development}} continuing throughout the YF-104A test phase and during service with the F-104A. The engine featured variable incidence compressor <b>stator</b> <b>blades,</b> a design feature that altered {{the angle of}} the <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> automatically with altitude and temperature. A condition known as [...] "T-2 reset", a normal function that made large <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> angle changes, caused several engine failures on takeoff. It was discovered that large and sudden temperature changes (e.g., from being parked in the sun prior to becoming airborne) were falsely causing the engine <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> to close and choke the compressor. The dangers presented by these engine failures were compounded by the downward ejection seat, which gave the pilot little chance of a safe exit at low level. The engine systems were subsequently modified and the ejection seat changed to the more conventional upward type. Uncontrolled tip-tank oscillations sheared one wing off of an F-104B; this problem was apparent during testing of the XF-104 prototype and was eventually resolved by filling the tank compartments in a specific order.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} {{analytical}} profiling of radial <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> is considered, which {{in combination with}} numerical modelling of three-dimensional viscous flows allows us to improve {{the efficiency of the}} flow part of high-loaded centripetal turbines. The profile of radial blades is determined in a curvilinear coordinate system and consists of the trailing and leading edges, and also of suction and pressure sides described by polynomial curves of the 5 th and 4 th order, respectively. Thanks to this method, highly efficient radial <b>stator</b> <b>blades</b> of high-loaded stages can be designed. The special form of blade-to-blade channels allows us to obtain a low level of profile and trailing edge losses, as well as low supersonic and shock wave losses of kinetic energy. Three variants of turbines with different types of <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> profiles are considered: the profile developed using a standard method for axial blades; the “half-drop” profile and the profile developed using the proposed method. For the stator profile developed in this paper, the stator kinetic energy losses related to the enthalpy drop in the stage were decreased by 2, 2 % compared to the profile of a classic form, and by 1, 1 % compared to the “half-drop” profile. Using of the high-loaded stage with a new type of <b>stator</b> <b>blade</b> profile allowed us to significantly improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the flow part in the whole stage.
