The statue is still missing its left hand and glasses. The KFC outlet where this statue once stood has since closed; the statue is now located at an outlet near Koshien Stadium.

25|$|New York City police detectives {{began their}} search {{by looking at}} Moore's apartment. Her {{departure}} {{seemed to have been}} abrupt and unplanned. Her cat had not been fed, nor any arrangements made for it. Prescription medication for the lupus she suffered from was left behind, and Moore had not <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> more pills from the pharmacy. Despite the shortcomings that ACS found in her treatment of her children, Moore had never missed family events such as birthdays of her children.|$|E
25|$|Behind a solid {{effort from}} running back Jermelle Lewis and wide {{receiver}} C.J. Jones, the Hawkeyes quickly jumped out to a 100 lead. And {{if it were not}} for a fumble punt, the game wouldn't have <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> closer. As it is, Michigan's Chris Perry scored moments later and Iowa took a 106 lead into halftime. After a Michigan field goal pushed the score to 109, Iowa took over. The Hawkeyes scored 24 unanswered points to finish the game as Lewis and Jones racked up two touchdowns each. Quarterback Brad Banks threw for 222 yards and three touchdowns as Iowa handed Michigan their worst home loss since 1967.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Gareth K. Vile of The Skinny {{gave the}} book {{three out of}} five stars, and commented, [...] "By {{transplanting}} his thuggish noir from Manchester to LA, Ray Banks' second Cal Innes novel has two sets of mean streets to pace. Not that his grasp of characterisation has <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> stronger: Donkey Punch is as terse and macho as Saturday's Child, although his hardboiled writing style has become more poised and confident." [...] Andrea Mullaney reviewed the book for Scotland on Sunday and wrote, [...] "Vivid and realistic, with an appealingly flawed hero and an interesting setting amid the underside of modern LA, this is a knockout." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{issue is}} controversial. Bethe {{considered}} Teller's {{contribution to the}} invention of the H-bomb a true innovation as early as 1952, and referred to his work as a [...] "stroke of genius" [...] in 1954. In both cases, however, Bethe emphasized Teller's role as a way of stressing that the development of the H-bomb could not have been hastened by additional support or funding, and Teller greatly disagreed with Bethe's assessment. Other scientists (antagonistic to Teller, such as J. Carson Mark) have claimed that Teller would have never <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> closer without the assistance of Ulam and others. Ulam himself claimed that Teller only produced a [...] "more generalized" [...] version of Ulam's original design.|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

[...] In 2006 Mike Fuhre, the former chief of the Kingwood VFD, criticized HFD for allocating fewer staff and pieces of equipment to Kingwood than had existed during the existence of the VFD. Fuhre said that there were occasions when Kingwood had no coverage because all of the firefighters were called to other locations, and still do.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 May 2016 Adams reiterated his {{apology for}} the use of [...] "nigger" [...] but {{appeared}} to double down on the use by saying [...] "The whole thing was to make a political point, if I had left that word out would the tweet have <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> attention?". He also stated [...] "I was paralleling the experiences of the Irish, not just in recent times but through the penal days when the Irish were sold as slaves, through the Cromwellian period."

The historical accuracy of these comments has been questioned by historians and met with a backlash in the media.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, the University of Oregon [...] "came under – and {{resisted}} – {{pressure from}} the Chinese consul general in San Francisco" [...] to cancel a lecture by Peng Ming-Min (see above). Glenn Anthony May, a UO history professor wrote an article expressing concerns that Confucius Institutes [...] "come with visible strings attached." [...] For instance, host institutions must sign a memorandum of understanding to support the One-China policy. [...] "At universities, we normally {{have an opportunity to}} debate issues like that, allowing professors like me and students to take issue publicly with our government's policy. Hanban, for obvious reasons, wants no such discussion to occur." [...] Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Portland State University, rejects May's criticisms CIs hinder open discussions of issues such as the treatment of political activist Liu Xiaobo. Meiru Liu explained that while Falun Gong, dissidents and 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are not topics the Confucius Institute headquarters would like to see organized by the institutes, they are [...] "not major interest and concerns now by general public at large here in the US." [...] Fellow UO professor and CI director Bryna Goodman countered May, noting the local Confucius Institute hosted forums on sensitive topics such as China's internet censorship and economic regulations, and [...] "We haven't <b>gotten</b> <b>any</b> topic that has been proposed to us that we have considered out of bounds." ...|$|E
