500|$|Inglis {{had close}} {{contacts}} with industry {{and was able}} to establish a professorship in aeronautical engineering and links with a nearby Air Ministry experimental flight station. [...] He was also successful in arranging with the War Office for Royal Engineers officers to study the Engineering Tripos at the university. [...] The university drew praise for the quality of its teaching during Inglis' tenure, though his department has been criticised for its [...] "comparative neglect of original research". [...] From 1923, he was involved with the analysis of vibration and its effects on railway bridges, including a period spent working with Christopher Hinton during the latter's final year as a student at Cambridge. [...] Inglis was appointed to a sub-committee of the British government's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Bridge Stress Committee by Ewing, who was chairman, and became responsible for almost all of the mathematics of the investigation. [...] Inglis derived a theory that allowed for the accurate assessment of the vibrations caused by hammer blow force imparted to the bridge by locomotives, and the committee's 1928 report included recommendations that the hammer blow force be included in bridge <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> in the future. [...] During the course of this work Inglis was able to show that the increased oscillation of bridges at train speeds beyond those that corresponded with the natural frequency of the bridge was due to the influence of the locomotive's suspension– the first time that this phenomenon had been explained. [...] Inglis' work on bridge vibration has been described as his most important post-war research. [...] He followed up the work by using a harmonic series and Macaulay's method to approximate the vibration of beams of non-uniform mass distribution or bending modulus. [...] This work is related to the later method used by Myklestad and Prohl in the field of rotordynamics.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, a {{group of}} activists and {{engineers}} calling themselves the New Alchemists believed the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. The New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional construction techniques, they designed a series of [...] "bioshelter" [...] projects, {{the most famous of}} which was the Ark Bioshelter community for Prince Edward Island. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, fish tanks raising tilapia for protein, a greenhouse watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the [...] "New Alchemy Institute". The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the turbine}} exit, the working fluid enters the {{condenser}} where it rejects heat, -Q, {{to the cold}} sea water. The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle, requiring condensate pump work, W. Thus, the Anderson closed cycle is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated {{more than a few}} degrees Fahrenheit. Owing to viscous effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser. This pressure drop, which depends on the types of heat exchangers used, must be considered in final <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> but is ignored here to simplify the analysis. Thus, the parasitic condensate pump work, W, computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included. The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work, W, and the warm water pump work, W. Denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by W, the net work from the OTEC plant, W is ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{engineers}} {{responsible for}} the design of the canal levees and the I-walls embedded in them overestimated the soil strength, meaning that the soil strength used in the <b>design</b> <b>calculations</b> was greater than what actually existed under and near the levee during Hurricane Katrina. [...] They made unconservative (i.e., erring toward unsafe) interpretations of the data: the soil below the levee was actually weaker than that used in the I-wall design (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 48). [...] Another critical engineering oversight that led to the failure of the 17th Street Canal involves not taking into account the possibility of a water-filled gap {{which turned out to be}} a very important aspect of the failures of the I-walls around New Orleans. [...] “Analysis indicate that, with the presence of a water-filled gap, the factor of safety is about 30 percent lower. [...] Because a factor of safety of 1.3 was used for design, a reduction of 30 percent would reduce the factor of safety to approximately one: a condition of incipient failure.” (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 51) This meant that the design included a safety factor of 30% ("1.3"), and could cope in theory with stresses 30% more than expected, but the error due to the water gap was about 30%, which immediately used up the entire safety margin, leaving no leeway in the design if any other excess stress occurred.|$|E
