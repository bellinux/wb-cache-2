An early Giorgio Chiellini header hit the bar and it {{set the tone for}} the first half, as the Italian international's team dominated the chances, but failed to score. Parma came into it in the second half and Sebastian Giovinco had opportunities to give them the lead. Both sides had dubious penalty appeals turned down and usual second choice goalkeeper Nicola Pavarini continued his good form in goal. Recently departed Hernán Crespo had said an emotional goodbye to the fans before the match.|$|E
25|$|In January 1969, McLain was {{selected}} as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, DC, but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled <b>for</b> <b>Wednesday</b> the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd. McLain was a nonconformist and liked to play by his own rules. He had learned to fly and purchased an airplane. Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning. He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9-2 lead. McLain created more dissension when he clashed with Tigers' manager Mayo Smith over the latter's role in the firing of Johnny Sain as the team's pitching coach. Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore's Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award. It was the last award of his major league career.|$|E

500|$|On 11 January 2008, Wallwork {{signed for}} Sheffield Wednesday on a free {{transfer}} {{until the end}} of the season, with a view to an extension afterwards. He made his debut the following day, coming on as a half-time substitute for Steve Watson in a 1–0 defeat away at Cardiff City. He lost his place in the team to new signing Adam Bolder, and although he came on as an early substitute for Graham Kavanagh against Charlton Athletic on 12 February 2008, he did not play for nearly another month until his appearance in a 2–1 victory against Queens Park Rangers. Wallwork played just seven games <b>for</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> who released him on 14 May 2008. He trained with former club Carlisle United in August 2008, but failed to earn a permanent contract.

Manager Danny Wilson described Cresswell as [...] "one for the future" [...] after admitting the player [...] "is not the striker people may perceive as the big one we were chasing". His debut came in Wednesday's 2–1 home defeat to Coventry City on 3 April 1999, before scoring his first goal with an 87th-minute winner at home to Liverpool in a 1–0 win on 8 May. He finished 1998–99 with one goal in seven appearances <b>for</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> Cresswell completed 1999–2000 with two goals in 25 appearances, having been given few opportunities in the team, as Wednesday were relegated into the First Division.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson congratulated Arsenal {{on their}} win and {{said of the}} game: [...] "It was about {{trying to make sure}} {{everyone}} was fit <b>for</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> I think we have managed to do that. There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E
