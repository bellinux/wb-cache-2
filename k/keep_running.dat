This greatly improved the availability of the system.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 Robert Triffin, Belgian American economist, {{noticed that}} holding dollars was more {{valuable}} than gold because constant U.S. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. What would later {{come to be known}} as Triffin's Dilemma was predicted when Triffin noted that if the U.S. failed to <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> deficits the system would lose its liquidity, not be able to keep up with the world's economic growth, and, thus, bring the system to a halt. But incurring such payment deficits also meant that, over time, the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> up and down a tree with nesting materials.|$|E

This would be {{parallel to the}} Fourth Avenue subway line, one block east under Fourth Avenue. Between either 10th or 19th Street (depending on which bridge option was chosen) and 39th Street, the BQX would definitively run along Third Avenue. From 39th Street to 58th Street, the BQX could swing west to 39th Street to serve Industry City, the Brooklyn Army Terminal, and the industrial center of Sunset Park; or it could <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> along Third Avenue and serve residents of western Sunset Park. The BQX would end at Third Avenue and 59th Street, {{a block from the}} entrance to the 59th Street subway station.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though this}} solar {{technology}} {{may have a}} higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel, the low maintenance and operation cost {{and the ability to}} operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to <b>keep</b> <b>running.</b> A small rural community could use a system like this indefinitely, and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup. In a larger community, it could at least contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival. This technology is capable of pumping hundreds of gallons of water per day, and is limited only by the amount of water available in the water table.|$|E

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{in dealing with}} the fossil fuel {{phase-out}} has been job loss. Companies in the fossil fuel industry have begun to experience the effects of the phasing-out of fossil fuels like coal. For example, Consol Energy, originally a coal-producing company, has begun the transition to becoming a natural gas producer. Not only does this shift affect its current role in the coal industry but it also has led to employment cuts. With the shuttering of coal plants, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association estimates that over one million jobs will be lost. With the coal industry aging, many coal mines are deteriorating and becoming costly to <b>keep</b> <b>running.</b> As a result, coal plants are no longer a reliable, go-to energy source for the United States.|$|E

Ip is allowed to <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> his school {{on the condition that}} he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun School and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames him since he wouldn't pay his protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and also insists they finish their fight, but during this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears, earning respect from him. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise is that we are going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant â€“ we <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E

Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said BeyoncÃ© was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E

2500|$|Probably {{the most}} famous play to evoke the Miracle of the Meadowlands, {{although}} with a very different outcome, occurred almost three decades later in a [...] As in 1978, an Indianapolis turnover on downs had given Pittsburgh {{the ball on the}} Indianapolis 2-yard line and an apparent three-point victory over the heavily favored Colts in the game's final two minutes. However, the Steelers had to <b>keep</b> <b>running</b> the ball, as the Colts still had all their timeouts left. A field goal would have at least required the Colts to score a touchdown (plus kick the extra point) to win the game, while a touchdown would essentially clinch victory, so it was in the Steelers' interest to <b>keep</b> <b>running.</b> A pass would run the risk of being intercepted, or seeing the defense knock the ball out of the quarterback's hand. But on the very first play, running back Jerome Bettis, who had not fumbled all season, had the ball knocked loose by Indianapolis middle linebacker Gary Brackett. Defensive back Nick Harper recovered the ball and appeared to be on the way to an Edwards-like touchdown, but Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger managed to tackle Harper near midfield.|$|E
