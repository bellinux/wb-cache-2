40|$|Background: For {{manufacturing}} suppliers, careful {{handling of}} business relationships with dealers {{is an essential}} function required for business success. End consumers rely on dealers for product information, advice and after sales support; all of which being factors capable of enhancing their perceived value of the product. The importance of the dealers for the end consumers implies {{that it is in}} the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to manage their relationship with the dealers in a satisfactory manner in order of gaining their support and commitment. In the case of suppliers in the Swedish market for outdoor power equipment, managing this relationship with servicing dealers is of great importance to their business success and viability. Successful management of such relationships requires coordination and cooperation. Thus, it is in the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> to understand how long-term cooperation with dealers can be enhanced. Purpose: Our research focuses on identifying determinants that enhance sustainable cooperation between manufacturers and servicing dealers in the Swedish outdoor power equipment market. Method: A survey was conducted among servicing dealerships in Sweden testing eight hypotheses developed through an adaption of Morgan and Hunts’ (1994) Commitment-trust theory together with an extensive literature review. The results were ana-lysed and tested with correlation analysis. Conclusions: Trust and commitment were found to be determinants in fostering sustainable cooperation between dealers and manufacturers in the Swedish market for outdoor power equipment. Furthermore, four important antecedents for dealer commitment were identified; supplier commitment, support, termination costs and participation. Whereas, communication was found to be an important precursor for trust...|$|E

40|$|In a broad sense, {{the term}} „competition” defines the {{relations}} between economic operators acting on the same market seeking attainment <b>of</b> certain <b>interests</b> in economic freedom conditions.

Hence, the need for prior assessment relating to the potential effect of a regulation on competition.

40|$|Advanced {{industrial}} countries provide over $ 120 billion annually on various {{terms and conditions}} to support exports and investments abroad. The regime governing these official trade finance (OTF) flows has puzzling features. The legal basis of the regime, officially known as the Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits (Arrangement), is ambiguous. Its proceedings are secret. Its membership is restricted to {{a relatively small number}} of states. Finally, some sectors and modes of finance are more tightly regulated than are others. Some are not regulated at all. My research goal was not only to explain the unusual institutional features and scope of the regime as it currently stands, but also to explain why this regime emerged. I argue that the Arrangement is best understood as a cartel comprised <b>of</b> the leading <b>suppliers</b> <b>of</b> state- backed trade finance. Supplier states comprise the rich {{industrial countries}} that "produce" official export finance or "give" foreign aid to finance the exports of capital goods, military equipment and agricultural products sought by buyer states. Buyer states are generally developing countries, which have limited ability to pay in cash or self finance these imports. (cont.) The cartel serves the collective <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> states in: 1) controlling the predatory use of export finance to shift rents from one supplier state to another; 2) controlling the unintentional transfers <b>of</b> wealth from <b>supplier</b> states to buyer states. By colluding to limit competition through jointly agreed upon rules, supplier states increase their market power vis-A-vis buyer states. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) became the forum of choice for the Arrangement because it permitted secrecy and selective membership that better aligned the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> states against buyer states. However, cartels, whether market distorting or market correcting, are imperfect arrangements. To succeed they require the control of a large market share., the presence of weak and disorganized buyers, and access to information on financing terms on a timely, ex ante basis. The body of evidence gathered for this dissertation shows this to hold true for official trade finance, explaining the variation in rule formation across sectors and across modes of financing. by Peter C.

40|$|As is {{the case}} for {{traditional}} goods, information providers must consider which product they want to offer to their customers at what price. Product policy, i. e. the presentation of the service offer (Meffert, 2005, 327), and pricing policy (Diller, 2008, 21 et seq.) are two of the central setscrews in a company’s marketing mix. The close connection of these two entrepreneurial action parameters becomes clear in the economical price definition (Diller, 2008, 31), in which the price is represented as a quotient of remuneration and scope of services. This exemplifies on the one hand that the customer always considers the relation between the re-muneration for and service of an offer. In this sense, prices can only be too high when the corresponding service is inadequate. On the other hand, the quotient makes the diametrically opposed <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> and customer very clear. Suppliers are interested in a particularly high price quotient, customers in a par-ticularly low one. Here, too, the context of our considerations will allow us only the mention of product and pricing policy’s particularities as relevant for information providers...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyUsing {{survey data}} on {{technical}} assistance projects that was collected by the International Competition Network's Competition Policy Implementation Working Group during 2004 and 2005, I estimate the effect {{of different types of}} technical assistance on several performance measures of recipient competition authorities. Moreover, I examine whether the impact of each type of technical assistance varies with the capacity of a recipient authority to absorb technical assistance (which I will refer to as absorptive capacity) and the socioeconomic development of the recipient country. A clear pattern of results emerges. Not all forms of technical assistance are alike in their effects and the impact on recipient authority performance appears to vary systematically with absorptive capacity and socio-economic development. Taken at face value, and supposing that maximizing the positive effect on recipient authority performance is the sole objective of a technical assistance programme in competition law and enforcement, these findings have implications for the mix of technical assistance activities that should be offered to competition authorities. These findings may, therefore, be <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to <b>suppliers</b> <b>of</b> technical assistance which include established competition authorities, aid ministries, and international organizations...|$|R
40|$|In many industries, the {{importance}} of software components provided by third-party suppliers is steadily increasing. As the suppliers seek to secure their intellectual property (IP) rights, the customer usually has no {{direct access to the}} suppliers' source code, and is able to enforce the use of verification tools only by legal requirements.

As the protocol is based on well-known (and relatively lightweight) cryptographic primitives, it allows a straightforward implementation on top of existing verification tool chains.

40|$|This model {{describes}} the working of hub-and-spoke collusion {{that has been}} discussed recently by competition policy authorities. We develop a model of tacit collusion between a manufacturer and two retailers, competing a la Rotemberg and Saloner (1986). The best collusive equilibrium between retailers is ine ¢ cient {{and it is in}} the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>supplier</b> to help retailers reach a more e ¢ cient collusive equilibrium. The hub and spoke conspiracy reduces double marginalization, but raises the ability of retailers to collude. The impact of a hub-and-spoke cartel on consumer’s welfare depends on the bargaining power in the relationship. If the supplier has the bargaining power, the agreement, comparable to a vertical restraint, can be welfare improving in reducing double marginalization. When retailers have the bargaining power, the agreement is closer to an horizontal agreement in which retailers use the supplier to improve their collusive scheme, which leads to a loss of welfare. The result has important implications for competition policy and antitrust enforcement which are further developed in our companion paper Sahuguet and Walckiers (2013).

After the Cold War, the focus on the importer's human rights record increase in exporter policies. We examine the arms transfer patterns of the four major democratic suppliers between 1976 and 2009 to determine empirically whether the patterns of transfers match policy. We argue that if practice matches policy, then democratic suppliers should not transfer weapons to states violating human rights. However, as global <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> these <b>suppliers</b> have shifted over time we condition our arguments by stating that if practice matches policy, then there still may be transfers of major weapon systems, but of types that are not as useful for violating human rights. We build on existing arms transfer literature by disaggregating exports based on weapons type. The ordered logits we run for each major democratic supplier from 1976 - 2009 show that the major democratic suppliers generally do not account for human rights violations in the importing state, with the one exception being the United States transfer of land weapon systems...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a two-echelon {{assembly}} {{system and}} explores several important issues in managing decen-tralized supply chains. First, we investigate {{the behavior of}} the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system’s competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm’s head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified. Under the transfer payment contract, the system optimal policy is the unique Nash equilibrium in the decentralized supply chain. Discussion on the relationship between our coordination scheme and existing methods in the literature is also provided.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The term Corporate Social Responsibility {{has evolved}} ever {{since it was}} coined in second half of 20 th century. Broadly, CSR is a way a {{business}} achieves a balance or integration of economic, political, social and ethical dimensions; {{while at the same}} time addressing shareholder and stakeholder expectations. CSR is a concept whereby corporate organizations take social responsibility and create products or services for greater good of the society and consistent with the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> customers, <b>suppliers,</b> employees, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders, as well as the environment. Most of the time, these activities and actions are considered to be on voluntarily basis to improve society. The way businesses engage/involve the shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, governments, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and other stakeholders is usually a key feature of the concept. However, considering various entities or stakeholders stated above, it is not surprising to note that conflict <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> exists among various stakeholders in respect of activities performed by a particular organization. Thus, a need arises to rethink the normative approaches to CSR and evaluate other avenues for a better solution. Considering that CSR is interdisciplinary and affects many facets of society simultaneously, it is considered that coopetition may hold the key to solve complex relationship of various stakeholders and their conflict <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Coopetition is a promising and challenging perspective to understand cooperation between competing individuals and/or organizations. In the literature, coopetition phenomenon has been connected with strategic alliances, territorial development work, and resource-based view.
