60|$|It {{was indeed}} time to stop; {{for on the}} barbecue, or terrace of white plaster, which ran all round the <b>front,</b> <b>lay</b> {{sleeping}} full twenty black figures.|$|E
60|$|They shot {{round the}} bend, and Jim threw down his pole. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a broad expanse of sand, broken by belts of shining water. A flock of oyster-catchers, {{screaming}} noisily, circled about the foreground; {{but this was}} all.|$|E
60|$|The Indian gravely {{raised his}} paddle, and {{pointed in the}} {{direction}} in which his own steady look was riveted. Duncan's eyes followed the motion. A few rods in their <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> another of the low wooded islets, but it appeared as calm and peaceful as if its solitude had never been disturbed by the foot of man.|$|E

60|$|We {{had come}} to an end. A great {{projecting}} buttress of crag rose sheer in <b>front.</b> Above <b>lay</b> loose boulders. Below was a shrub-hung precipice. The birds we had seen from home were still circling and screaming.|$|R
2500|$|On the <b>front</b> lawn <b>lay</b> {{the bodies}} of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims, except Parent, had been stabbed {{numerous}} times. The coroner's report for Tate noted {{that she had been}} stabbed sixteen times, and that [...] "five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal".|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} gloom began to lighten {{and they came}} out into the {{luminous}} clearness of the tropic night. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a few flat blocks of houses, surrounded by fields of cane, and {{here and there a}} patch of broad-leafed bananas. Passing through the silent village they reached a long building which Gomez said was the Romanez hacienda.|$|E
60|$|Erling did the same, {{and both}} drew up their steeds {{with their backs}} towards an impenetrable thicket. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a level stretch of ground, {{encumbered}} only here and there {{with one or two}} small bushes, beyond which they had a view far into the dark forest, where the armour of the approaching horsemen could be seen glancing among the tree stems.|$|E
60|$|They {{were passing}} through a verdant glen {{at the foot of}} the mountains, the air of which was perfumed with wild flowers, and filled with the garrulous music of paroquets and monkeys. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the grand range of the Winterberg, with its coronet of rocks, its {{frowning}} steeps, its grassy slopes, and its skirts feathered over with straggling forest,-- all bathed in the rich warm glow of an African sunset.|$|E
50|$|The army {{participated in}} the Leningrad-Novgorod and Pskov-Ostrov operations, the later while {{assigned}} to the 3rd Baltic Front.In the late hours of , long-range bombers from the Baltic Fleet attacked the main German command points on the defensive line, presaging the Krasnoye Selo-Ropsha Offensive. On January 14, troops from both the Oranienbaum foothold and Volkhov Front attacked, followed the next day by troops of the 42nd Army {{under the command of}} Ivan Maslennikov from the Pulkovo Heights. An artillery barrage was launched all along the <b>front,</b> <b>laying</b> down 220,000 shells onto the German lines. Fog inhibited major progress for the first few days, although the 2nd Shock Army and 42nd Army advanced two miles on a seven-mile front while in combat with the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions.|$|R
6000|$|The queen {{remained}} {{for some time}} at Moclin, administering comfort to the wounded and the prisoners, bringing the newly-acquired territory into order, and founding churches and monasteries and other pious institutions. [...] "While the king marched in <b>front,</b> <b>laying</b> waste {{the land of the}} Philistines," [...] says the figurative Antonio Agapida, [...] "Queen Isabella followed his traces as the binder follows the reaper, gathering and garnering the rich harvest that has fallen beneath his sickle. In this she was greatly assisted by the counsels of that cloud of bishops, friars, and other saintly men which continually surrounded her, garnering the first fruits of this infidel land into the granaries of the Church." [...] Leaving her thus piously employed, the king pursued his career of conquest, determined to lay waste the Vega and carry fire and sword to the very gates of Granada.|$|R

60|$|One afternoon--a bright glowing afternoon--in {{the autumn}} of the year, Mr Hazlit sat in a {{favourite}} bower {{in the garden of}} his cottage, with Aileen on one side of him, and Edgar on the other. At the foot of the garden a miscellaneous group of boys, girls, and babies, of all ages, romped and rolled upon the turf. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the yellow sands, and, beyond, the glorious glittering sea rolled away to the horizon.|$|E
60|$|We sat together, upon a day, in {{the shade}} of a ravine far from the barracks, where a {{watercourse}} used to run in rainy weather. Behind us was the scrub jungle, in which jackals, peacocks, the gray wolves of the North-Western Provinces, and occasionally a tiger estrayed from Central India, were supposed to dwell. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the cantonment, glaring white under a glaring sun; and on either side ran the broad road that led to Delhi.|$|E
60|$|The {{light was}} rapidly going {{and the wind}} was falling. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a stretch of moor, seamed by black peat-hags, in some of which water glistened; beyond the moor rough heather-covered slopes ran up to the black hillcrest. A curlew whistled overhead, and the sharp cry of a grouse rose from the darkening heath. Except for this, it was very still and the {{landscape}} looked strangely desolate. Not far ahead a patch of roof showed faintly among some stunted ash-trees.|$|E
5000|$|Prof. Sahay demitted the Office as Founder Director of IIM Raipur {{after about}} {{six and a}} half years (2010-2017) on a very {{satisfying}} note. IIM Raipur has been ranked at 14th position in India in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIFR2017) ranking released by MHRD, GoI. Last year IIM Raipur was ranked at 18th position in the NIRF2016. There has been excellent growth on all <b>fronts</b> <b>laying</b> a very solid foundation. IIM Raipur is today known for academic excellence, high quality research, strong international and corporate linkages. Placement has been outstanding since inception. Over one-third of the PGP Class went overseas to complete their one term under exchange program to partner institutions. Doctoral Programs of IIM Raipur are most sought after with about 60 research scholars on roll. Some of them will be receiving Fellowship in the 6th Annual Convocation this year. It is important to share that construction of 200 acres of state-of-the-art campus is going in full swing and will be ready by December 2017. This has been possible with the support and guidance of one and all.|$|R
50|$|In October 1916, Herbert {{started his}} post as a liaison {{officer with the}} Italian army, whose <b>front</b> line <b>lay</b> in Albania. He {{apparently}} {{was unaware of the}} clause partitioning Albania signed with Italy in the secret Treaty of London on 26 April 1915. When the Bolsheviks published its secret provisions in 1917, he rejected the idea of Albania as merely a small Muslim state, the fiefdom he believed of Essad Pasha. In December, he was back in England.|$|R
2500|$|The extratropical cyclone {{that would}} set the {{synoptic}} stage for the outbreak was centered over northwestern Montana at 7 am CST on March 17. Meanwhile, a diffuse area of surface low pressure was centered near Denver, Colorado in association with a lee trough. Occluded <b>fronts</b> <b>lay</b> from Hudson Bay southwestward into the northern Plains states and into the lee trough. The synoptic cyclone moved south-southeastward across the mountain states to eastern Colorado. A warm front stretched along the Gulf Coast, separating warm, moist air from cool showery weather with areas of fog that extended from Texas to the Carolinas. A well-mixed early season continental tropical (cT) air mass existed over West Texas and northern New Mexico. To the east of this hot, dry air, buoyant maritime tropical (mT) air was advecting from the Gulf of Mexico. Simultaneously, a mid to upper level shortwave trough likely approached the northwest coast of the US and moved rapidly through the persistent ridge then digging southeastward across the Great Basin and central Rocky Mountains and emerging in the Plains over Colorado. This initiated [...] "Colorado low" [...] cyclogenesis.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{squadron}} of Hussars which came first {{to the spot where}} the rebel flag had waved. A dense litter of Arab dead marked the place. Within, the flag waved no longer, but the rifle stood in the mimosa bush, and round it, with their wounds in <b>front,</b> <b>lay</b> the Fenian private and the silent ranks of the Irishry. Sentiment is not an English failing, but the Hussar captain raised his hilt in a salute as he rode past the blood-soaked ring.|$|E
60|$|She {{continually}} peeped {{out through}} the lattice, but could see little. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the brown leaves of last year, and upon them some yellowish-green ones of this season that had been prematurely blown down by the gale. Above stretched an old beech, with vast armpits, and great pocket-holes in its sides where branches had been amputated in past times; a black slug was trying to climb it. Dead boughs were scattered about like ichthyosauri in a museum, and beyond them were perishing woodbine stems resembling old ropes.|$|E
60|$|The {{window at}} which he stood was in {{the second floor of}} that portion of the castle which was nearest to the keep. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the broad moat, with the moon lying upon its surface, now clear and round, now drawn {{lengthwise}} as the breeze stirred the waters. Beyond, the plain sloped down to a thick wood, while further to the left a second wood shut out the view. Between the two an open glade stretched, silvered in the moonshine, with the river curving across the lower end of it.|$|E
6000|$|A {{cart and}} horse beside the rivulet stood; [...] Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone. [...] She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood [...] As the wain <b>fronted</b> her,--wherein <b>lay</b> one, [...] A pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone. [...] 545 [...] The carman wet her lips as well behoved; [...] Bed under her lean body there was none, [...] Though even to die near one she most had loved [...] She could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved.|$|R
60|$|The engine whistle shrieked out {{and once}} more the din of {{conflict}} headed to the <b>front.</b> Neale <b>lay</b> there, seeing {{the reality of what}} he had so often dreamed. These old soldiers, these toilers with rail and sledge and shovel, these Irishmen with the rifles, they were the builders of the great U. P. R. Glory might never be theirs, but they were the battle-scarred heroes. They were as used to fighting as to working. They dropped their sledges or shovels to run for their guns.|$|R
60|$|Harry Esmond got off {{the horse}} to run to his mistress, as did little Frank, {{and one of the}} grooms took charge of the two beasts, while the other, hat and periwig in hand, walked by my lord's bridle to the <b>front</b> gate, which <b>lay</b> half a mile away.|$|R
60|$|In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> an {{upheaval}} of rock, stretching {{almost like}} a wall across the line they were following. It {{was a sort of}} natural outwork, pushed out by nature in front of the hill, and rose some fifty feet above the level of the plain. There were many places at which it could be climbed, and up one of these the track ran obliquely. Hitherto it had been but an ill-defined path, but here some efforts had been made to render it practicable, by cutting away the ground on the upper side, to enable laden mules to pass up.|$|E
60|$|I said nothing. It did {{not seem}} that talking would do any good, and the {{engineer}} might not have welcomed my advice. The great light was very close. I could see the cars behind it and hear the grind of brakes, while a man was bent double over a lever where the blaze of our head-lamp ran along the ground. The engine rocked beneath us; there was a heavy lurch as the fore-wheels struck the points; then Robertson laughed exultantly and wiped his greasy face. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> only the open prairie and flying snow, while the black shape of the freight-train grew indistinct behind.|$|E
60|$|The {{extensive}} enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of these, {{three or}} four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it was {{in the rear of the}} house. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holy-days.|$|E
60|$|Now the Easterns stayed their advance, {{for their}} <b>front</b> ranks <b>lay</b> prone, and those behind must climb over {{them if they}} could. Yes, {{standing}} there in glittering groups they rocked and hesitated although their officers struck them with swords and lances to drive them forward. Once more our front rank rose and loosed, and once more we dropped and let the shafts of the second speed over us. It was too much, flesh and blood could not bear more of those arrows. Thousands upon thousands were down and the rest began to flee in confusion.|$|R
60|$|Outside all {{was calm}} and quiet. The night was fine, {{and the stars}} were {{twinkling}} brightly overhead. The little <b>front</b> garden <b>lay</b> before the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.|$|R
60|$|Down {{the hall}} they went, Bridge leading {{with the boy}} and girl close at his heels while the two yeggs brought up the rear. Their {{footsteps}} echoed through the deserted house; but brought forth no answering clanking from the cellar. The stairs creaked beneath the unaccustomed weight of so many bodies as they descended toward the lower floor. Near the bottom Bridge came to a questioning halt. The <b>front</b> room <b>lay</b> entirely within his range of vision, and as his eyes swept it he gave voice to a short exclamation of surprise.|$|R
60|$|Now {{with the}} shadows of the night a weight of fear seemed to be lifted off our hearts and we grew hopeful, aye, almost joyous. That hated city was behind us. Behind us were the Khania with her surging, doom-driven passions and her stormy loveliness, the wizardries of her horny-eyed mentor, so old in years and secret sin, and the madness of that strange being, half-devil, half-martyr, at once cruel and a coward--the Khan, her husband, and his {{polluted}} court. In <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the fire, the snow and the mystery they hid, sought for so many empty years. Now we would solve it or we would die. So we pressed forward joyfully to meet our fate, whatever it might be.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{waited for}} the reports with breathless attention, I was much struck at that moment by the {{singularity}} of {{the circumstances in which}} we were placed. On our left stood the rhinoceros, not fifteen yards off; on our right the giraffe raised his long neck above the bushes, about twenty yards distant, apparently uncertain whether it was safe to advance to the water; while in <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> the lake, reflecting the soft, clear moonlight, and beyond that the phalanx of elephants, enjoying themselves vastly. I had but two moments to take it all in at a glance, for Jack said [...] "Now!" [...] in a low tone, and instantly the loud report of the two rifles thundered out upon the night air.|$|E
60|$|The sure-footed mules, braced {{hard against}} {{the weight of the}} carriage, slid down a steep descent across {{slippery}} stones when Clare, who wondered {{what would happen if the}} worn-out harness broke, rode into Adexe. Gleaming white houses rose one above another among feathery palms, with a broad streak of darker green in their midst to mark the shady alameda. Behind, the dark range towered against the sky; in <b>front</b> <b>lay</b> a foam-fringed beach and the vast blue sweep of dazzling sea. Music came up through the languid murmur of the surf, and the steep streets were filled with people whose clothes made patches of brilliant color. The carriage jolted safely down the hill, and Clare looked about with interest as they turned into the central plaza, where the driver stopped.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} hours of , {{long-range}} bombers from the Baltic Fleet attacked the main German command {{points on the}} defensive line. On January 14, troops from both the Oranienbaum foothold and Volkhov Front attacked, followed the next day by troops of the 42nd Army {{under the command of}} Ivan Maslennikov from the Pulkovo Heights.

Fog inhibited major progress for the first few days, although the Second Shock Army and 42nd Army advanced two miles on a seven-mile front while in combat with the 9th and 10th Luftwaffe Field Divisions, and the Volkhov Front pushed the Germans back about three miles. It thawed on the 16th, and the Second Shock Army managed to move forward 23 kilometers. On the 19th, the Second Shock Army captured Ropsha and the 63rd Guards Rifle Division, part of the 42nd Army, drove the Germans out of Krasnoye Selo. By January 26, German troops had been pushed 100 kilometers away from the city, and the Moscow-Leningrad Railroad line had been opened. The next day, Stalin declared the city to have been relieved, and Leningrad celebrated with a red, white and blue salute from 324 Katyusha rocket launchers and artillery pieces at 8 pm, which was inconceivable during the siege due to blackout.|$|R
60|$|Yard by yard {{the speed}} increased, and yard by yard the black {{stallion}} drew ahead. Now in <b>front</b> of them <b>lay</b> a furlong {{or more of}} bad ice encumbered with lumps of frozen snow {{that had not been}} cleared away, which caused the sleigh to shake and jump as it struck. Lysbeth looked round.|$|R
60|$|It was nightfall by {{the time}} the launch was clear of the bayou. In <b>front</b> of them <b>lay</b> the calm waters of Lake Sico--a shallow expanse, with mud flats at one side and a {{wilderness}} of trees, bushes, and wild canebrake at the other. They shut off the power and listened. Not a sound broke the stillness.|$|R
