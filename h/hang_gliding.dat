5|$|Some of the area's large reservoirs, {{for example}} Carsington Water, have become centres for water sports, {{including}} sailing, fishing and canoeing, {{in this most}} landlocked part of the UK. Other activities include air sports such as <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and paragliding, birdwatching, fell running, off-roading, and orienteering.|$|E
5|$|The Manor Park Club multi-sports complex, {{close to}} the town centre, {{provides}} the area with indoor and outdoor sports facilities including tennis, squash, indoor bowls, racketball, archery and table tennis. It is assisted by grants from various bodies, including the Malvern Hills District Council, the Sport England Lottery, and the Lawn Tennis Association. In 2010, a new indoor facility was unveiled at the club by tennis player Tim Henman. Traditional outdoor bowls is played on a green in Priory Park. Other public areas such as Victoria Park in Malvern Link provide space for field sports and tennis. Malvern Town FC has a football first team that plays in the West Midlands Regional League and which has twice reached the third qualifying round of the FA Cup. The Malvern Hills are a popular launching site for <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and paragliding and Malvern has a local <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> club. Cricket is provided for at Barnards Green Cricket Club, a professional class ground.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight {{simulator}} {{that puts the}} player in control of one of six pilots {{as they try to}} earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and <b>hang</b> <b>gliding.</b> Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings is {{an amateur}} flight {{simulator}} {{game in which}} the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, <b>hang</b> <b>gliding,</b> skydiving, {{and the use of}} a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.|$|E
5|$|Within this {{framework}} certain sectors of GA are governed on a devolved basis. In all cases the CAA/EASA retains responsibility for safety regulation, but representative bodies, particularly of sectors {{that are not}} included in the scope of EASA, are granted greater oversight of their activities. The majority of microlight aircraft are regulated by the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA), although a significant number are regulated by the Light Aircraft Association (LAA), formerly known as the Popular Flying Association. The LAA is the primary regulator for amateur built aircraft, as well as vintage and classic aircraft. Parachuting is governed by the British Parachute Association, although the aircraft used in this activity are generally CAA-regulated. Balloon and airship flying is overseen by the British Balloon and Airship Club. The UK-specific National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) is administered by the National Pilots Licensing Group Ltd., supported by the LAA, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association UK, the British Gliding Association, and the British Microlight Aircraft Association. Separate from these devolved groups, gliding in the UK is self-regulated. The British Gliding Association was until recently responsible for glider airworthiness, now formally regulated as a result of EASA legislation, and still retains control of pilot certification. <b>Hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and paragliding activities (i.e. foot-launched gliders) are governed by the British <b>Hang</b> <b>Gliding</b> and Paragliding Association.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational <b>hang</b> <b>gliding,</b> hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, <b>hang</b> <b>gliding,</b> is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E

25|$|Horse racing {{events are}} held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at the Jockey Club. An {{impressive}} place with excellent grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best {{horses in the}} nation. <b>Hang</b> <b>gliding</b> in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide excellent take-off locations and great landing zones on the beach.|$|E
25|$|Damage and {{disturbance}} {{to wildlife}} : Wildlife may be {{disturbed by the}} level of use {{on some of the}} areas of the parks that are open to the public. Moorland and chalk downland is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. Orienteering, mountain biking and <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of types differing in the {{construction}} of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and paragliding. However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare. Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as the paper plane and balsa wood glider.|$|E
25|$|Church Stretton is a {{major centre}} for the sport of archery, {{and there is also}} a gliding air field and station atop the Long Mynd, owned by the Midland Gliding Club.

He died from injuries incurred after BASE jumping off Angel Falls in Venezuela, the highest waterfall in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Paresev {{completed}} nearly 350 flights {{during a}} research program that ran from 1962 until 1964. Using the fully flexible parawing or the tube-stiffened paraglider of the Paresev 1A, 1B, 1C as an alternate to spacecraft recovery was deemed too unreliable upon unfolding so round parachutes for water landings were used instead. The Paresev and other flexible-wing {{projects such as}} the Ryan XV-8 stopped being funded by NASA on 1965. Although Rogallo wrote about, modeled, and spoke about recreational applications including <b>hang</b> <b>gliding,</b> NASA {{was not in the}} business of applying Rogallo's family of airfoils to personal aircraft such as kites, hang gliders, and powered light aircraft.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s Østfold County Municipality {{was working}} with {{proposals}} for establishing a civilian airport in Østfold. Although the county was home to Rygge Air Station, Østfold did not house any civilian airports. In 1986 the Civil Aviation Administration recommended that an airport be constructed at Rudskogen in Rakkestad. Widerøe stated that they would consider international flights to Gothenburg and Copenhagen. The plans evolved into a center for aerial and motor sports. Rudskogen Motorsenter was being planned as Eastern Norway's main road racing circuit and would be situated next to the airport. The airport would become the basis for sailplanes, <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and parachuting, in addition to recreational aircraft.|$|E

500|$|To {{establish}} better transport capabilities, {{and create}} a solid ground for the emerging air sports that are already available in the town (e.g. <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> or paragliding), an airport is planned northeast of the city, between the Krapina River and the railroad. The land at this location is unused, uninhabited, and administratively selected for sports and recreation. The arrangement of the runways, taxiways, air traffic control building, hangar, and other necessary buildings have already been determined. The airport is intended to serve primarily as a sports airport, for teaching flying, and for charter flights. [...] the date when the construction starts {{had not yet been}} announced.|$|E
500|$|Lake James {{has been}} {{the site of a}} plane crash and a rare <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> fatality. [...] In 1971 a Piper Tri-Pacer crashed into Lake James, killing the pilot. [...] The plane was flying at low {{altitude}} when a wing hit the water about [...] from the shore. The wing was torn off, and the plane plunged into water about [...] deep. [...] Another fatality happened in 1972, when a hang-glider was killed. The kite was being pulled by a boat when the flyer lost control, causing the kite (and flyer) to plummet about [...] before striking the surface of the lake. [...] The lake has also been the site of accidents involving thin ice. An example transpired in January 1985 when four snowmobiles broke through thin ice, and three people drowned.|$|E
500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are <b>hang</b> <b>gliding</b> and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main events in Pilotwings 64 {{required}} to complete the game, {{each of which has}} its own objectives and unique flight controls centered around the Nintendo 64 controller's single analog stick. The first, <b>hang</b> <b>gliding,</b> usually requires the player to fly through a series of floating marker rings or snap a photograph of a particular piece of scenery before landing in a target area. The player's movement is affected by wind currents and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the [...] "Rocket Belt", a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt's equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings or popping large balloons before landing. The third event, the gyrocopter, challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles. Pilotwings 64 also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions. The player can also earn medals on many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the [...] "Jumble Hopper", which grants the player special spring-loaded boots to be used in bouncing across the landscape to an end space. Lastly, Pilotwings 64 features a [...] "Birdman" [...] mode that puts the character in a bird suit and gives players the opportunity to freely explore the game's detailed, object-dense environments set among its four distinct islands. One of the islands is based on the United States, and has geographical replications of famous landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore and major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City.|$|E
