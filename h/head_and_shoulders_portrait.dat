The photograph was blurred as the authorities suspected {{him of being}} a minor. In November 2011, van Helsum's DNA {{was taken to a}} local police data bank after he initially refused to give a sample. Fingerprints and photographs, along with DNA samples, circulated through Interpol and other major police forces and showed that Van Helsum did not have a criminal record. Police attempted to search for a grave with no success and Van Helsum was unable to locate the forest he was living in. A couple from Switzerland had contacted police to come forward believing that Van Helsum was their grandson and had DNA samples taken.|$|E
50|$|Of the European {{painters}} of the subject, the Flemish Jacob Jordaens depicted Odysseus escaping {{from the cave}} of Polyphemus in 1635 (see gallery below) and others chose the dramatic scene of the giant casting boulders at the escaping ship. In Guido Reni's painting of 1639/40 (see below), the furious giant is tugging a boulder from the cliff as Odysseus and his men row out to the ship far below. Polyphemus is portrayed, as often happens, with two empty eye sockets and his damaged eye located in the middle on his forehead. This convention goes back to Greek statuary and painting and is reproduced in Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein's 1802 <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>portrait</b> of the giant (see below).|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 Denomie {{decided to}} create a {{portrait}} a day for one year {{as a way to}} make painting more of a priority in his life. His busy life wasn't allowing him to work in the studio as often as he liked, and upon returning to the studio after a week of not working he felt like a foreigner. This has led to a collection of hundreds of portraits, primarily small scale works (5x7 inches, 6x8 inches) of American Indians that Denomie describes as [...] "Rugged Indians". The <b>portraits</b> are generally <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>portraits,</b> with the individual faced forward, taking between 15-30 minutes to complete. The concept, similar to Chris Ofili's Afro Muses series, allowed for Denomie to get his [...] "head into the oven" [...] of art creation. Succeeding at this project, Denomie is currently not painting a portrait a day.|$|R
2500|$|Strathcona is commemorated in Manitoba by the Rural Municipality of Strathcona and {{by three}} streets in Winnipeg: Donald Street and Smith Street in the {{downtown}} core, and Strathcona Street in the city's West End. In Alberta he is commemorated by the Calgary neighbourhood of Strathcona Park by the Edmonton neighbourhood of Strathcona, and by the municipality of Strathcona County. In British Columbia, the Vancouver neighbourhood of Strathcona {{takes its name from}} the Lord Strathcona School built in 1891, and Mount Sir Donald in Glacier National Park is named after him. There are oil portraits of Lord Strathcona by many artists, but the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury seems to have made a number of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>portraits</b> of him from 1898 (examples may be found at the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad offices, and in the Hudson's Bay Company [...] ), and the artist also presented his 1899 bust-length charcoal and crayon drawing of Strathcona to McGill University in Montreal in 1916.|$|R

50|$|Crosse's work is refined, and in {{the best}} {{examples}} the sitters really {{look as if they}} could walk right out of the frame, they are so lifelike. Crosse’s miniatures often seem to be dominated by a shade of greenish-blue, maybe influenced by the early work of Joshua Reynolds. His works tend to have a greenish-blue hue to them, and his red pigments have faded a little over the years. He seldom signed his work. The fashion of the time was for women to increasingly wear their hair high on their head, and often it was powdered. It is interesting to see how Crosse manages to fit a <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>portrait</b> of a lady with stacked hair on to such a small piece of ivory. Men generally wore their hair ‘en queue’, pulled back into a ponytail tied with a black ribbon; often they wore powdered wigs over their hair, or powdered their hair directly.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, {{which became}} {{very popular in}} Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which {{promoted}} simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, {{where it had been}} considered [...] "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness" [...] (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of Zen master Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>portrait.</b> This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the suiboku-ga, or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.|$|E

He created the first photographic images of the islands and its peoples as well as images of missionary work, which were distributed commercially through Henry King of Sydney.

5000|$|Helen Huth {{was painted}} by George Frederic Watts, {{probably}} shortly before her marriage, 'looking like a mere girl' [...] {{in a painting}} (formerly in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) which has now disappeared, and he painted her again in a full-length portrait around 1857, two years after her wedding, a portrait that 'enjoyed considerable status {{as part of the}} noted collection of modern art featuring the work of Watts and Whistler that the sitter and her husband formed after their marriage in 1855.' Both Louis Huth and Helen Huth were depicted in magnificent marble portrait busts by a leading sculptor of the Victorian age, Alexander Munro, both busts exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1860. Helen Huth was also painted by Watts in a <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>portrait</b> in the early 1860s. The importance of the Huths in Watts' oeuvre of portraits cannot be under-estimated. Apart from four other women, Watts painted more portraits of Helen than any other - four in total - which, as Bryant noted, 'sheds light on the interaction between sitter and portraitist.' Next Helen Huth was painted by Whistler, in a painting entitled Arrangement in black, no. 2: portrait of Mrs Louis Huth, for which Huth paid 600 guineas. [...] Painted in 1872-3, some 13 years after the bust by Munro was modelled, the portrait reflects Whistler’s admiration for Velásquez, an appreciation shared by Louis Huth. It was first shown publicly at Mr Whistler's Exhibition, Flemish Gallery, Pall Mall, London, 1874. [...] In addition to Whistler’s portrait of Mrs Huth, the Huths owned other works by Whistler, including the paintings Symphony in White, No. 3 (Barber institute of Fine Arts, University of Birmingham); and Variations in Pink and Grey: Chelsea (Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, United States), for which latter painting Huth paid 250 guineas; and the Venice watercolours The Bridge; flesh colour and brown (The Burrell Collection, Glasgow Museums); The Storm - Sunset (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University); and Fishing Boat (Cincinnati Art Museum). [...] They also owned other paintings by Watts, including Daphne, (untraced), Galatea, Sir Galahad (sold Christie’s, London, 19 February 2003, lot 34), and Una and the Red Cross Knight (exhibited at the Royal Academy 1869, Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight).|$|E

Since <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are linked {{together by the}} neck, constraints for the motion of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> exist which are exploited to improve the motion estimation. In this paper, the human neck joint is modelled by a spherical joint between <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> its 3 D position is calculated.
