5|$|Both {{character}} and actress received mixed reviews from critics throughout the series; Baxendale received the Best Actress {{award from the}} Broadcasting Press Guild for her portrayal of Rachel in the pilot and {{was nominated for a}} British Comedy Award. However, television reviewers criticised the character when the series began. Rachel's diagnosis with Asherman's syndrome in the fourth series drew criticism from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which had been consulted during the writing of the storyline. When the series ended, there was a 20% increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> taking out life insurance policies with one provider, Tesco Personal Finance, which a spokesperson for the company attributed to Rachel's premature death.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bridge on}} the site was a toll bridge built by Julian Tolmé in 1873, in the {{expectation}} that the western terminus of the Hammersmith and City Railway would shortly be built on the north bank, leading to a sharp increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> wanting to cross the river at this point. The railway terminus was not built, and problems with drainage on the approach road made access to the bridge difficult for vehicles. Wandsworth Bridge was commercially unsuccessful, and in 1880 it was taken into public ownership and made toll-free. Tolmé's bridge was narrow and too weak to carry buses, and in 1926 a Royal Commission recommended its replacement.|$|E

5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor.

Overall we observed that there exist similar patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authors as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers <b>in</b> a component in both journals and conferences, which shows the moderate increase over 2001 - 2010. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> experimental results show that there is a marginal deviation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers <b>in</b> component, which ranges from 2.93 to 3.63 on average. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authors <b>in</b> component shows a bigger deviation than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> papers whose range is from 4.21 to 7.06 on average.

25|$|A permit {{cancellation}} {{policy was}} adopted in 1998.

But with the rapid rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> using the Smith River, FWP changed this policy in 1998, so that cancelled permits would not be reissued on any week when the number of people on the river exceeded 300.

A 2014 review found a 5% increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} how changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions from waiting lists and changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to <b>the</b> lists {{are related to}} list size and waiting times, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of local waiting list initiatives. DESIGN [...] Review of national and Körner statistics. SETTING [...] England (1987 - 94) and districts of the former Oxford region (1987 - 91). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Correlation <b>of</b> quarterly changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions from waiting lists in England with changes in total list size, <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> patients waiting one to two, or over two years, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to <b>the</b> lists; examination of changes in waiting list statistics for individual district specialties in one region in relation to funding for waiting list initiatives. RESULTS [...] Nationally, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions to hospital from lists closely correlated with changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to lists (r = 0. 84; P < 0. 01). After adjusting for changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> additions to lists, changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions correlated inversely with changes in list size (r = - 0. 62; P < 0. 001). Decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients waiting from {{one to two years}} were significantly associated with increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> admissions (r = - 0. 52; P < 0. 01); locally, only six of 44 waiting list initiatives were followed by an increase in admissions and a fall in list size, although a further 11 were followed by a fall in list size without a corresponding increase in admissions. CONCLUSIONS [...] An increase in admissions improved waiting times but did not reduce list size because additions to the list tended to increase at the same time. The appropriateness of waiting list initiatives as a method of funding elective surgery should be reviewed...|$|R
25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation {{is likely to}} be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

Some teachers and civil servants were expelled from Czechoslovakia while some left due to the harsh circumstances. There are many examples of Hungarians who were forced {{to leave their homes}} from this territory (two famous ones are the families of Béla Hamvas, and of Albert Szent-Györgyi). The high number of refugees (and even more from Romania) necessitated entire new housing projects in Budapest (Mária-Valéria telep, Pongrácz-telep), which gave shelter to refugees numbering at least in the ten-thousands.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a crisis}} arrived. The United States {{drastically}} reduced its immigrant quotas, causing shipping companies {{to lose a}} large part of their income and to have to adapt to this circumstance. The Great Depression also played an important role, causing a drastic decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> crossing the Atlantic {{and at the same time}} reducing the number of profitable transatlantic voyages. In response, shipping companies redirected many of their liners to a more profitable cruise service. In 1934, in the United Kingdom, Cunard Line and White Star Line were in very bad shape financially. Chancellor of the Exchequer Arthur Neville Chamberlain proposed to merge the two companies in order to solve their financial problems. The merger took place in 1934 and launched the construction of the Queen Mary while progressively sending their older ships to the scrapyard. The construction of a second ship, the Queen Elizabeth, was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.|$|E

Poverty and migration are caused mostly {{by the lack of}} economic development in the state, which leaves most of {{the population}} working in the least productive sector.

Within Oaxaca, many people leave rural villages to work in the city of Oaxaca, the Papaloapan area and the coast.
