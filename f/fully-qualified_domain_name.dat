40|$|A <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> is {{a unique}} {{alphanumeric}} designation that facilitates reference to sets of numbers which actually locate a particular computer on the Internet. <b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> are a fundamental part of the Internet&# 039;s user interface. Improving the usability of the Internet depends upon effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy. This study is intended to contribute to improvement in Internet usability for the end users of <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> Benefits of more usable <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> include: higher sales, customer satisfaction and productivity, and reduced support costs. <b>Domain</b> <b>name</b> policies worldwide vary considerably. Consequently, end users are inconvenienced by contradictory <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies, diminishing the predictability of an entity&# 039;s <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> and thus decreasing usability for end users. The study objective was to develop criteria with which policy makers can evaluate their <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies, {{in order to improve}} the usability of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> for end users. The main research question posed was: What are the criteria for an effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy? The research methodology included a literature review, <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy examination and an ethnographic narrative. The literature review found existing research examining either <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> or usability in isolation. However, research examining the intersection of the two is scarce. The existing research describes <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> as part of the web user interface. In practical terms, this is about how people use <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> to access web sites, email addresses and other Internet resources. It was established that the predictability (and thus usability) of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> relies on effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy. The non-standardised and widely delegated process of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy development leads to unpredictable and inconsistent <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> The narrative recollection presented the researcher&# 039;s inside perspective on the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> industry, with a focus on <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> usability. The researcher provided first-hand insights into the evolution of the industry and policy development process, from Australian and international perspectives. To address the problem of poor <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> usability, a framework for <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy evaluation is proposed. The framework extends the current research that treats <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> as a user interface by proposing criteria which address usability concerns. The framework allows policy makers to critically assess <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies with end users in mind. Examples of the criteria include: understanding who are its intended and untended users, and whether it&# 039;s consistent with other <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> The framework has the potential to set an international standard for the critical evaluation of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy, and become the basis for further research. This study was developed from the researcher&# 039;s perspective as a participant in the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> industry. A secondary lens regarding the usability of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> was then applied. This study has only scraped the surface in terms of how the research fields of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> and usability may be considered together. The research methodology for this study was primarily qualitative and interpretive. A quantitative study of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies globally could provide further insight into areas including: the differences in second level country code <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> and language implications of <b>domain</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the legal}} issues, which brought by the {{development}} of information and communication technologies, is also the issue of <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> With the development of the Internet, many human activities moved into the electronic world, including business activities.

40|$|Legal {{protection}} of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> The {{main purpose of}} this thesis is to provide complex information about the topic of <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> In the last fifteen years, <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> have become a very valuable estate, that can generate millions of dollars. The value of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> have been a cause of various exploitations, namely speculative domain registrations of attractive <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> These registrations are infringing third person rights, mostly trademark rights. The issue at hand with <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> {{seems to be the}} registration process. The first come, first serve principle that is associated with <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registration can be a cause of various legal infringements. The thesis is divided into eight chapters.

50|$|<b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> {{are often}} simply {{referred}} to as <b>domains</b> and <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registrants are frequently {{referred to as}} domain owners, although <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> registration with a registrar does not confer any legal ownership of the <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> only an exclusive right of use for a particular duration of time.
