5|$|Richard Wesley Hamming (February 11, 1915 – January 7, 1998) was an American {{mathematician}} {{whose work}} had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications. His contributions include the <b>Hamming</b> <b>code</b> (which {{makes use of}} a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), and the Hamming distance.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunication, a <b>Hamming</b> <b>code</b> is {{a linear}} error-correcting code. Hamming codes can detect {{up to two}} {{simultaneous}} bit errors, and correct single-bit errors; thus, reliable communication is possible when the Hamming distance between the transmitted and received bit patterns is {{less than or equal}} to one. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can only detect an odd number of errors. Hamming codes are of fundamental importance in coding theory and remain of practical use in modern computer design. Hamming codes were invented in 1950 by Richard Hamming at Bell Labs.|$|E

2500|$|Like EIA-608 bits are {{transmitted}} {{in the order}} of LSB to MSB with odd parity coding of 7-bit character codes. [...] However unlike EIA-608, the digital DVB version is transmitted the same way. [...] For single bit error recovery during transmission, the packet address (page row and magazine numbers) and header bytes [...] (page number, subtitle flag, etc.) use <b>hamming</b> <b>code</b> 8/4 with extended packets (header extensions) using hamming 24/18, which basically doubles the bits used.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunication, <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> are {{a family}} of linear error-correcting codes that generalize the Hamming(7,4)-code, and were invented by Richard Hamming in 1950. <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without {{detection}} of uncorrected errors. By contrast, the simple parity code cannot correct errors, and can detect only an odd number of bits in error. <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> are perfect codes, that is, they achieve the highest possible rate for codes with their block length and minimum distance of three.|$|R

40|$|Generalized Tanner graphs {{have been}} implicitly studied {{by a number}} of authors under the rubric of {{generalized}} parity-check matrices. This work considers the conditioning of binary hidden variables in such models in order to break all cycles and thus derive optimal soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoding algorithms. Conditionally cycle-free generalized Tanner graphs are shown to imply optimal SISO decoding algorithms for the first order Reed-Muller codes and their duals - the extended <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> - which are substantially less complex than conventional bit-level trellis decoding. The study of low-complexity optimal SISO decoding algorithms for the family of extended <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> is practically motivated. Specifically, it is shown that exended <b>Hamming</b> <b>codes</b> offer an attractive alternative to high-rate convolutional codes in terms of both performance and complexity for use in very high-rate, very low-floor, serially concatenated coding schemes.
