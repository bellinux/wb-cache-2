5|$|Jackson {{also stated}} during the 1993 {{interview}} that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended {{to be part of}} one of many being filmed. He sustained second-degree burns to <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first {{in order to deal with}} the intense pain.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1984, Michael {{and other}} members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi {{commercial}} overseen by executive Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to <b>his</b> <b>scalp.</b> Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor. Dusenberry recounted the episode in his memoir, Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach of more than 20 countries and would provide financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi, which later signed other music stars such as Britney Spears and Beyoncé to promote its products.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about as big as a dollar where the redskins had taken <b>his</b> <b>scalp.</b> It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E

The following events happened extremely quickly. Bryant took aim from his hip and pointed his rifle at Moh Yee (William) Ng and Sou Leng Chung, who were visiting from Malaysia, who were at a table beside Bryant. He shot them at close range, killing both instantly. Bryant then fired a shot at Mick Sargent, grazing <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> and knocking him to the floor.

25|$|In 1960, age 64, Breuning was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer. It was successfully treated and the cancer did not return. Breuning {{did not have any}} other health issues until he broke his hip at the age of 108. He spent eight days in the hospital and was totally healed in 21 days. In November 2007 at the age of 111, Breuning was fitted with hearing aids. The week before his 113th birthday in September 2009, Breuning fell and bruised <b>his</b> <b>scalp,</b> but was otherwise unhurt. Breuning was in excellent health, walking unaided and refusing to use the elevator to reach his second floor apartment until he broke his hip. Breuning began to slow down physically in his last year, requiring first a walker and then a motor scooter to get around although his mental state was undiminished to the end.|$|E
25|$|During {{his playing}} career, Raja was known {{primarily}} as a dashing middle-order left-handed batsman, with a characteristically generous backlift and breathtaking stokeplay combining a keen eye with wristy execution. Raja also bowled flat wrist spin {{with his right hand}} that was good enough to take 51 wickets in Tests, with <b>his</b> <b>scalps</b> including Clive Lloyd, Roy Fredericks, Glenn Turner and Viv Richards. In all, he played in 250 first-class matches, scoring 11,434 runs at an average of 35.18, including 17 centuries, and taking 558 wickets at an average of 29.05.|$|R

500|$|German machine gunners had {{occupied}} a commanding vantage overlooking the sunken road, {{and began to}} rain down heavy fire around Towner's position. One of the bullets struck his helmet, inflicting a gaping wound to <b>his</b> <b>scalp.</b> Refusing to be evacuated for medical treatment, Towner continued firing his gun as the German pressure increased and the situation grew critical. Eventually the Australian infantry were forced to retire a short distance, but with all its crew having become casualties, one gun was left behind. Alone, Towner dashed out over no man's land and retrieved the weapon. With this gun he [...] "continued to engage the enemy whenever they appeared", putting a German machine gun out of action with his accurate fire.|$|E
500|$|A biographer {{states that}} in 1993, the {{entertainer}} admitted taking Valium, Xanax, and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him. While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> resulting from his accident in 1984. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately [...] in weight and had stopped eating. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking. He could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with. It took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums.|$|E
500|$|The head wounds are {{consistent}} with a 1485 poem by Guto'r Glyn in which a Welsh knight, Sir Rhys ap Thomas killed Richard and [...] "shaved the boar's head". It had been {{thought that this was}} a figurative description of Richard being decapitated, but the skeleton's head had clearly not been severed. Guto's description may instead be a literal account of the injuries that Richard suffered, as the blows sustained to the head would have sliced away much of <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> and hair and slivers of bone. Other contemporary sources refer explicitly to head injuries and the weapons used to kill Richard; the French chronicler Jean Molinet wrote that [...] "one of the Welshmen then came after him, and struck him dead with a halberd", and the Ballad of Lady Bessie recorded that [...] "they struck his bascinet to his head until his brains came out with blood." [...] Such accounts would certainly fit the damage inflicted on the skull.|$|E

60|$|This {{taking the}} hair off people's heads, or scalping, {{as it is}} called, is a common {{practice}} among the North American Indians. When a savage kills his enemy he runs <b>his</b> <b>scalping</b> knife round the dead man's head, seizes the hair {{with his left hand}} and tears the scalp off. Indeed this dreadful cruelty is sometimes practised before death has occurred. The scalp with its lock of hair is taken home by the victor, and hung up in his tent as a trophy of war. The man who can show the greatest number of scalps is considered the greatest warrior. The dresses of Indian warriors are usually fringed with human scalp-locks.|$|R

500|$|During the New X-Men story arc [...] "The Quest for Magik," [...] Anole and {{his classmates}} are sucked {{down into the}} {{dimension}} of Limbo by the demon Belasco. They are soon attacked by {{a large group of}} demons, and Anole takes charge, rallying the students around the defenseless Blindfold, only to have his right arm severed at the shoulder by a demon. Later he is trapped in stone by the machinations of Darkchilde as she attempts to create a powerful Soulsword from Pixie's soul. Anole manages to break himself free and stop Darkchilde from completing the process, saving Pixie. Anole then finds that he has generated a larger and stronger reptilian arm replacing the one he lost, a previously unknown aspect of his mutation. The arm itself is spikey, resembling <b>his</b> <b>scalp,</b> with razor sharp claws.

500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli’s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came <b>his</b> <b>scalp.</b> Lalli then died a painful death.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men {{under the command of}} Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the {{surrounding}} country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback. [...] This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. [...] The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. [...] A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, [...] "Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out?" [...] upon which he was slashed on <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.|$|E

500|$|The Week two {{game of the}} 1964 {{season was}} played in Pittsburgh. Tittle was brutally tackled by Steelers {{defensive}} end John Baker during the second quarter. It was here that Morris Berman, a photographer for the Pittsburgh Gazette, snapped a now famous picture of the injured quarterback kneeling {{on the ground with}} blood running down <b>his</b> <b>scalp.</b> Tittle spent that night in a hospital, then returned to play the following week. But {{it was clear that he}} was not the same player, and the Giants finished with a disappointing 2-10-2 record. Tittle retired the following summer, and in 1971 was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Following the season Gifford and Alex Webster announced their retirement, and Jack Mara, who had been President of the team for since he was 22, died at the age of 57. [...] The team rebounded with a 7–7 record in 1965, before compiling a league-worst 1–12–1 record in 1966, with their defense setting a new league record by allowing over 500 points. This season also included a 72–41 loss to the rival Redskins at D.C. Stadium in the highest-scoring game in league history. Interest in the team was waning, especially with the rise of the AFL's New York Jets, who featured a wide-open style of play and a charismatic young quarterback in Joe Namath.|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into <b>his</b> <b>scalp</b> regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E
