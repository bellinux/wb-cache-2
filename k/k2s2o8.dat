50|$|Potassium persulfate is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula <b>K2S2O8.</b> Also known as potassium peroxydisulfate or KPS, it {{is a white}} solid that is highly soluble in water. This salt is a powerful oxidant, commonly used to initiate polymerizations.|$|E
5000|$|The peroxydisulfate ion, , is a oxyanion. It is {{commonly}} referred to as the persulfate ion, but this term also refers to the peroxomonosulfate ion, [...] Approximately 500,000 tons of salts containing this anion are produced annually. Important salts include sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8), potassium persulfate (<b>K2S2O8),</b> and ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8). These salts are colourless, water-soluble solids that are strong oxidants.|$|E

Upon {{reaching}} this temperature, {{a total of}} 200 grams of potassium peroxidisulfate (<b>K2S2O8)</b> in portions of about 40 grams each is added at intervals of, for example, 1 hour. After addition of the final portion of oxidant, stirring is continued for 3 hours. The product is then filtered, washed to free it of alkali substances, dried at a temperature of approximately 80° C and reduced to particle form.|$|E
40|$|Electrolytes of {{different}} types are almost always present in wastewater and they can control some of {{the properties of the}} water. These electrolytes can even determine the appropriate method for wastewater treatment. Recently, these electrolyte effects were used in a suitably designed bubble column evaporator (BCE) for a surprisingly large range of water treatment processes, including solute decomposition and coliform inactivation, which were pioneered in the present work. It was discovered that hot inlet air, e. g. at 150 °C, could be pumped into a BCE to produce a continuous flow of hot bubbles, whose surfaces can decompose thermally unstable solutes, such as NH₄HCO₃ and <b>K₂S₂O₈.</b> The experimental results indicated that the BCE process was more efficient than direct heating, especially when bubble coalescence inhibition effects caused a reduction in bubble sizes and increased bubble densities of the hot bubbles within the column. A continuous stream of hot bubbles in a BCE was also used to develop a novel coliform inactivation method. In this process, it appears that the membranes of microorganisms colliding with these hot bubbles can be thermally disrupted, which leads to their failure and leakage and so the inactivation of the organism. Importantly, in addition to the inhibition effects of electrolytes on bubble coalescence, specific electrolytes can also affect electrostatic surface forces between bubbles and cells and so can play a significant role, in one example increasing the inactivation rate from 29 % to 99. 9 %, by the addition of a low level of CaCl₂. Lastly, the study of the effects {{of different}} ions (e. g. monovalent, divalent and trivalent) on a monitor microorganism (i. e. Escherichia coli) was carried out. This led to a comprehensive and relatively integrated understanding of the cell’s surface charging properties in aqueous solutions, of use in the development of water treatment processes. Many techniques like zeta potential, light scattering size measurement, coliform colony incubation and so on were applied in this study. In addition, phospholipid vesicles were used as surface charging models for these cells and the effects of various ions were studied on their stability and charge...|$|E
40|$|The bubble column {{evaporator}} (BCE) was {{studied for}} novel applications {{in determining the}} enthalpy of vaporisation (ΔHvap) of concentrated salt solutions, decomposing solutes in salt solutions and controlling chemical precipitation. These BCE applications have potential uses in many industries, such as in desalination and water treatment. The project involved studies on the physical properties of various salt solutions by the main method of the BCE process. The BCE process offers a novel utilisation of the gas/liquid interface where the heat and mass transfer is efficiently carried out. Fine bubbles are produced through a porous sinter when a gas is sparged into column solutions. These bubbles, due to the inhibition effect of coalescence in some concentrated salt solutions, can be maintained at a small size to produce a high-density bubble column. The theoretical basis of the BCE process was also studied by modelling the energy balance in the column, the evaporation process and the solute decomposition process. ΔHvap values for concentrated salt solutions were accurately and precisely determined using a BCE system at room temperatures. It was established {{that the use of}} a vacuum space around the column and automatic-temperature-acquisition systems can enhance the accuracy and precision of these ΔHvap measurements. The accuracy was better than 1. 0 % compared to literature values. The BCE method typically gave high precision of ΔHvap data with a normal distribution. It was discovered that hot inlet air, at 150 C, can be used in the BCE to produce a continuous flow of hot surfaces, which can thermally decompose unstable solutes, such as NH₄HCO₃ and <b>K₂S₂O₈.</b> It was found that the BCE process was significantly more efficient than direct heating, for example, using a water bath at the same temperature. Lastly, it was discovered that chemical precipitation from supersaturated solutions was strongly inhibited by the BCE process. When CaCl₂ and Na₂SO₄ solutions were mixed to precipitate CaSO₄. 2 H₂O, the BCE process inhibited induction and growth of the precipitates, which were otherwise readily formed in a simple stirred system. These results suggest that the BCE process could be useful for the controlled production of nanometre and micrometre size particles...|$|E
