40|$|Egypt {{has been}} able to escape high {{inflation}} by depleting its stocks of creditworthiness, money illusion, and enforceable foreign-exchange controls. These nonrecoverable assets are quickly becoming extinct and the economy is on an unsustainable path. The authors present a short- and medium-term dynamic model of the Egyptian economy and use it to simulate the effects on output and inflation of a stabilization-cum-adjustment program. Their conclusion is to make the public sector live within its means, and to do so at once. This is a demanding prescription; political and social pressure can become intolerable under adjustment. The authors show that both a slowdown in output and the initial rise in inflation associated with a tough reform program will be short-lived. And a <b>do-nothing</b> <b>strategy</b> will soon push the country into a serious crisis, the correction of which will certainly be more painful.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of adult HIV/AIDS in Thailand is declining due to intense prevention strategies, {{but it still}} {{continues to be a}} critical health problem with a {{prevalence of}} 1. 5 %. Several HIV vaccine candidates for the prevention of HIV infection or progress to AIDS were examined in clinical trials. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a vaccination regimen (rBCG prime-rDIs boost) currently in its pre-clinical phase. The cost-effectiveness of three interventions (vaccination, highly active antiretroviral treatment [HAART], and the combination of the two) through an existing vaccination program was assessed in a Markov model. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was the main effectiveness measure. In the base case the efficacy of the vaccine for preventing HIV infection was assumed to be 30 %. The cost of the vaccine was estimated {{on the basis of its}} predicted production capacities in Thailand. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of vaccination, HAART, and the combination were about $US 75, $US 610, and $US 267 per DALY averted compared with the <b>do-nothing</b> <b>strategy</b> in the base case. The HAART-only strategy seemed to be less cost-effective than the other options under the current assumptions. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the new HIV infection rate and the vaccine efficacy could affect the results...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore an {{important}} but relatively uncharted territory: the actual functioning of performance measurement systems (PMS) in their organisational context. The objective of the paper is to document the ways in which managers go about aligning operational measures with their organisation's strategy in practice. Design/methodology/approach - This research adopts an interpretive multiple-case approach in order to gather rich data on the strategies used in managing operational PMS. Data were collected from detailed interviews with managers and supervisors in four government agencies. Findings - The expectations were that the operations managers would adjust their performance measures to support the changes in strategy. This was not the case. All the interviewees employed one or more tactics to cope with the tensions between strategy and performance measures. The ten tactics identified are collected into three strategies; <b>do-nothing</b> <b>strategy,</b> pseudo-realigning strategy, and distracting strategy. Research limitations/implications - This paper casts some doubt on the practice, rather than the principle, of strategy-aligned performance management. More work needs to be carried out to ascertain how other, both for profit and public sector, organisations deal with these tensions in practice. Practical implications - From a practitioner point of view it raises the question as to whether senior managers are exerting sufficient control over the alignment issue or providing suitable tools, methods or indeed incentives to bring alignment about. Originality/value - The paper highlights a gap between theory and practice and suggests that the way to ensure implementation of "modern management methods," might be to deal firstly with the issues of relevance, timeliness, structure, integration, and symmetry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} truck lane restriction on urban freeways using traffic simulation models. The study includes three main parts: Part (1) provides insights into conditions under which truck lane restrictions would work well; Part (2) identifies the best number of lanes to restrict and shows {{that this is an}} important factor in the success of lane restriction; Part (3) investigates potential impacts of truck lane restriction through a case study using a region with some of the highest truck volumes in the U. S., the I- 710 corridor in Los Angeles County, California. The study begins by examining the potential impacts of truck lane restrictions using two representative hypothetical freeways. This is because the impacts of truck lane restrictions will vary with differing traffic and geometric conditions. Results suggest that truck lane restriction could work well when the rate of flow is more than 1300 vehicles per hour per lane and where trucks make up at least 10 percent of the total traffic. Three scenarios are developed. These are <b>do-nothing</b> (no <b>strategy</b> implemented), alternative I (the one leftmost lane restricted from trucks), and alternative II (the two leftmost lanes restricted from trucks). These are examined in a pair-wise manner. Results show that determining the best number of restricted lanes is very important. Through the I- 710 case study we find that alternative II would have the most positive effects on traffic congestion and travel time variance. Based on these results, we conclude that truck lane restriction strategies, which are very simple and cost-effective to implement, may contribute to improved traffic flow on urban freeways.

40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{evidence}} to guide the management of otitis media with effusion (OME), which is a common problem causing significant hearing impairment in children with cleft palate. The insertion of grommets is currently being used to correct hearing impairment and prevent complications of unmanaged OME, but there is ongoing discussion about whether the benefits of grommets outweigh the costs and risks. A decision-tree model was developed to assess the surgical insertion of grommets with two non-surgical alternatives (hearing-aids and do-nothing strategies) in cleft palate children with persistent bilateral OME. The model assumed a 2 -year time horizon and a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were valued using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated by linking utility values with potential hearing gains measured in decibels. Multiple data sources were used, including reviews of the clinical effectiveness, resource use and utility literature, and supplemented with expert opinion. Uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Expected value of perfect information {{analysis was used to}} calculate the potential value of future research. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the grommets strategy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 9, 065 per QALY gained compared with the <b>do-nothing</b> <b>strategy,</b> and the hearing-aids strategy was extended dominated by the grommets strategy. The population expected value of perfect information was £ 5, 194, 030 at a willingness to pay threshold of £ 20, 000 per QALY, implying that future research could be potentially worthwhile. This study found some evidence that the insertion of grommets to manage cleft palate children with bilateral OME is likely to be cost-effective, but further research is required to inform this treatment choice...|$|E
30|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of household adaptation, different classifications of adaptation measures have been constructed, but classifications of adaptive households are rare. Harvatt et al. (2011) categorized households into active and non-active types; non-active households respond with a <b>do-nothing</b> <b>strategy</b> {{as a result of}} denying the risk or living with it, whereas active households take reducing or changing measures. By classifying the measures undertaken by households, Thurston et al. (2008) categorize flood resistance and resilience measures into categories of temporary resistance (e.g. installing door guards), of permanent resistance (e.g. permanent flood proof external doors), of resilience without resilient flooring (e.g. raising electrics) and of resilience with resilient flooring (e.g. sealed floors). Linnekamp et al. (2011) categorize flood protection into individual actions, such as raising the level of own yards, and collective actions, such as assisting neighbours in undertaking protective measures. Classifications of adaptation measures and of households with regard to their adaptation behaviour also exist in studies on river flooding. Precautionary river flooding measures can be categorized according to their costs and efforts: low-cost measures (e.g. relocation of water-sensitive objects), medium-cost measures (e.g. flood-adopted interior fitting) and high-cost measures (e.g. flood proof air conditioning) are mentioned as household and household business measures by Kreibich et al. (2011). Adaptive behaviour can also be classified into protection against financial risks (by purchasing insurances), acquisition of information about precaution and precaution itself, by flood-proofing and retrofitting property (e.g. adapting use of building) (Thieken et al. 2007). An example of a classification of specifically structural protection measures is the one study carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA London (2008)), which distinguishes between measures at property-level (e.g. against the entry of water into the house) and resilience (reduction of damaging by entered water). The classification methods applied in these studies differ; ad-hoc classifications are frequently used, whereas systematic approaches, such as statistical ones, have not been used extensively in the literature on household-level adaptation to coastal and river flooding.|$|E
