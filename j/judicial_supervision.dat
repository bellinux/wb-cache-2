500|$|Before the 1979 Act, English law did {{not provide}} many ways to avoid the Case Stated procedure, even prohibiting parties from agreeing in advance not to use it; {{this was due to}} Scrutton LJ's statement, in Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, that [...] "There must be no Alsatia in England where the King's writ does not run". In The Lysland, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales gave a {{decision}} interpreted as saying that the courts must consider a Case Stated [...] "even if there is no great some in dispute, no point of general importance is involved or the answer is reasonably clear". Lord Denning's statement in that case has been described as [...] "he death knell of arbitrator autonomy", and led to arbitrators almost automatically asking for <b>judicial</b> <b>supervision</b> for fear that they would otherwise be found to have committed misconduct. For obvious reasons, companies and parties to a case who submit their issues to arbitration expect something private, quick, and cheap, with fixed results. The traditional English emphasis on judicial oversight, therefore, meant that with the Case Stated procedure, London was a highly unpopular venue for arbitration.|$|E
500|$|Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, the {{decision}} {{in which it was}} decided agreements excluding <b>judicial</b> <b>supervision</b> are invalid, is partially overruled by Sections 3 and 4.

Section 3(6) provides an exception, which covers [...] "domestic" [...] arbitration agreements; these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom, and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in the UK. In this situation, the exclusion clause is only valid if agreed to after the start of arbitration. A second exception is found in Section 4(1); where the contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction, to do with commodities trading, or an insurance agreement, it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after the start of arbitration or the law applicable to the contract is not that of England and Wales. In any situation, the High Court can be asked to give a decision on a point of law, or the exclusion clause removed, should all parties agree.|$|E

40|$|Back in the sixties, {{everyone}} quipped that “Negro removal” – not “urban renewal” – was {{the driving}} force for metropolitan gentrification. Behind the joke, there was an underlying truth – witnessed in the developing law of eminent domain. Thus, the same United States Supreme Court that had pondered the racial repercussions of the “separate but equal” doctrine in Brown and demanded that classification based on race be scrutinized with particular care in Bolling, upheld the eviction of thousands of African Americans as a proper exercise of eminent domain only six months later in Berman. Bearing in mind that public purposes are the heart of eminent domain, {{this article focuses on}} the takings law’s paradoxical treatment of destitute segments of American society, including racial minorities. The analysis that follows spotlights the “blinding” strategies that powerful partisan players use to keep the political phase in the making of “public goods” under the radar of public consciousness and potential pretext claims. The “blinded rider” dilemma discussed below shifts eminent domain’s focus from “holdouts” to the political process that controls the definition, means and limits of public purposes. It therefore exposes the congested nature of all public goods, specifically the existence of a political platform abundant with competing public goods bearing different prospects but also distinct distribution disparities. It is the author’s hope that, by bringing the “blinded rider” phenomenon to the fore, this article will enable courts to capture fully the risks and benefits {{associated with the use of}} eminent domain, reduce the distribution disparities imposed by eminent domain, and correspondingly improve the adequacy of the “just compensation” condition. Equipped with this broader understanding of public goods’ theory, <b>judicial</b> advanced <b>supervision</b> would direct the use of eminent domain power for the benefit of all segments of society, including those historically most disadvantaged...|$|R

40|$|In {{the social}} and {{economic}} history of Iran, as of other Moslem countries, bazaars and guilds of craftsmen and tradesmen working in them have always played an important part. After a discussion of the historical background, this thesis examines the functions of the guilds in the later Safavid period (c. 1597 - 1722 A. D.), when Iran was a large and generally stable empire administered on bureaucratic rather than feudal lines. Guild practices and traditions from the period endured into the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Evidence is adduced to show that the guilds had a dual role as spontaneous associations for defence of their members' interests and as agencies used by the Safavid government for collection of taxes, control of prices, and procurement of goods and labour. Among the subjects which are examined are the functions of responsible officials and headmen, the taxes and the tax collection methods, the apprenticeship system, price <b>supervision,</b> <b>judicial</b> and penal matters, and guild restrictions. Attention is also given to the Safavid government's intervention in economic life through royal industrial establishments and royal monopolies. Although merchants were not organized in guilds, they influenced the life of the bazaars, and so too did the East India Companies which established "factories" in Iran during the period. Attention is therefore given to the activities of Muslim Iranian, Armenian, Jewish, and Hindu merchants and financiers, and of the English and Dutch East India Companies...|$|R

Tabled in 1979, {{this is the first}} time a digitised version of this report, known as the 2 ̆ 7 Bowen report 2 ̆ 7, has been made publically available. The intention to establish this inquiry was announced in a press statement issued by the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser on 16 December 1977. The statement mentioned the difficult position in which a Prime Minister finds himself when he is called upon to pass judgment on colleagues with whom he has worked closely, particularly as the Prime Minister must act as a judge and jury when allegations of impropriety are raised. Fraser expressed his disatisfaction with a previous inquiry on the topic, conducted by a Parliamentary committee. He stated that he would instead he would appoint a judge or Queen 2 ̆ 7 s Counsel, to be assisted by a businessman and an accountant, to carry out a new inquiry. On 15 February 1978 Fraser stated that the new inquiry would be conducted by the Chief Judge of the Federal Court of Australia, the Hon. Sir Nigel Bowen, K. B. E., as well as Sir Cecil Looker, and Sir Edward Cain, C. B. E. The terms of reference were: 1. To recommend whether a statement of principles can be drawn up on the nature of private interests, pecuniary or otherwise, which could conflict with the public duty of any or all persons holding positions of public trust in relation to the Commonwealth. 2. To recommend whether principles can be defined which would promote the avoidance and if necessary the resolution of any conflicts of interest which the Inquiry may, under paragraph (1) above, find to be possible. 3. In the event of a finding under paragraph (2) above that principles can be defined, to recommend what those principles should be. 4. Without limiting the scope of paragraph (3) above, to recommend whether or not a register under <b>judicial</b> or other <b>supervision</b> should be maintained so that, in the event of allegations of impropriety, the allegation may be open to judicial investigation and report. 5.

40|$|Giving {{effect to}} the {{constitutional}} right to equality and the peculiar nature thereof in a heterogeneous society such as South Africa {{has proved to be}} a perplexing task. This is apparent when analyzing case law on the subject which demonstrates that our courts are regularly confronted with complex equality claims, and as a consequence, naturally have to make difficult decisions which in turn contribute toward our emerging and developing equality jurisprudence and ultimately the achievement of the constitutional standard of equality. This treatise considers substantive equality as a species of equality in the workplace and the defence of affirmative-action justification in terms of section 6 of the Employment Equity Act. In doing so, it outlines the seemingly peculiar application of affirmative action in a society that was once divided along racial and gender lines, a society that has once experienced one of the most severe forms of racial discrimination in the form of apartheid and its associated laws, policies and practices. This oppressive political regime had the effect of entrenching a deep legacy of racism, deprivation, exclusion and discrimination into the social fabric of society, which in turn had a disproportionate impact on the majority of people or categories of people relative to an elite minority. The legacy of this oppressive political system remains alarmingly evident today. The treatise reveals the challenges and difficulties a society faces in attempting to break with past patterns of disadvantage and its efforts to build a society that is non-racist, non-sexist, socially just and inclusive. The Constitution with its transformative vision should be considered the genesis of this credible and abiding process of redress. It is this exercise of redress coupled with the Constitution’s transformative mandate that raises difficult issues of restoration and reparation for past injustice, and the most appropriate and accommodating manner to do so. In addition to the Constitution, Parliament has enacted national legislation as a transformative agent in the workplace. The EEA as a legislative instrument was designed to give effect {{to the constitutional}} right to equality in the workplace. It emphatically prohibits unfair discrimination, but also obliges designated employers to implement affirmative-action measures. For such measures not to be unfairly discriminatory, they must be consistent with the purpose of the EEA. A plain reading of the EEA reveals that it does not provide sufficient guidelines for valid affirmative action. However, the EEA provides an interpretive injunction in that it must be interpreted in light of the Constitution and international law. In this regard the Constitutional Court in Minister of Finance v Van Heerden 1 in interpreting the Constitution, developed a test to assess whether a restitutionary measure such as affirmative action is in fact and in law a valid measure. To date this test is generally not followed, despite the authority of the judgment. In this regard, the courts have developed sound, but sometimes inconsistent principles and standards to test for the validity of affirmative action and to adjudge whether such measures are compliant with the Act. The test has also recently been reaffirmed in the recent judgment of South African Police Service v Solidarity obo Barnard. 2 It is anticipated that affirmative-action case law will henceforth develop along the same lines. In this we appreciate <b>judicial</b> guidance and <b>supervision</b> in interpreting and pronouncing upon the legitimacy and validity of affirmative-action measures...|$|R
