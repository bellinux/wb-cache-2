However, many species of Gomphonema Ehrenb. do not have a wide round pole that resembles a head, instead they may have the same contour on both poles.

40|$|Abstract: Caprinuloidea rudists are locally {{abundant}} and widespread in Lower Cretaceous (Albian Stage) Edwards Formation in Texas. Landward {{of the shelf}} margin on the shallow marine Comanche Shelf rudists built circular and elongate bioherms with coarse-grained flank deposits. Two caprinid morphotypes suggest that some lived as elevators above the substrate and others were recumbent upon mobile grain flats. Elevators have elongated attached valves and weakly coiled <b>free</b> <b>valves</b> and recumbents have arcuate attached valves and strongly coiled <b>free</b> <b>valves.</b> Detailed morphologic studies are not possible on the many molds and casts, but a few specimens are silicified. Their internal structures {{can be seen by}} X-ray computed tomographic scanning (CT), which provides three-dimensional representations of internal features. This technique enables the specific identification of caprinid rudists that otherwise could only be identified by sectioning the specimen. The abundant Edwards species is identified as Caprinuloidea perfecta because it has only two rows of polygonal canals on its ventral and anterior margins. X-ray CT images reveal ontogenetic stages of these unusual gregarious bivalves. Allometric to isometric growth characterizes the left-free valve (LV). Although the prodissoconch is unknown, the plots suggest that the initial length was greater than the width, which is like the D-shaped prodissoconch of Cardiacea. The LV has the morphology of loosely coiled gastropods an...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Process {{industry}} involves large plants; mainly {{operating in}} continuous form, to achieve economic mass production output. However {{in some situations}} process vessels and tanks are used, where batch processes, take place. These tanks often contain reactants and products in the liquid state. After treatment or processing, valves are opened to allow the product to drain and vessels may receive the next batch. However, with conventional valves {{there will always be}} an amount of fluid trapped between the valve closing element and the tank or vessel, especially for those which are jacketed to allow heating or cooling. This amount is usually untreated, that is to say has not undergone the changes or processing taking place on the fluid bulk in the vessel. Moreover, no matter how accurately this amount is estimated to be isolated from the processed amount leaving the vessel, it will still contaminate with the processed product. From hygiene point of view, this may not be accepted. In this work a valve design is introduced; where no fluid is trapped between a process tank and the valve closing element. When the valve is opened the fluid flows to the outlet flow line without any contamination with unprocessed fluid. Thus a contamination <b>free</b> <b>valve</b> design is utilised to achieve hygiene design tanks or vessels used in batch based processes. Thus cheap equipment acquiring the hygiene requirements necessary for food and some other products that only can be achieved using expensive mass production lines is obtained...|$|E

50|$|On {{the front}} end of the cranks, there are 30-degree {{inclined}} rods that are connected to the inclined plungers of the pump proper. The unusual diagonal plungers were created in part by the limitation of the existing engine room. The crank configuration is set in a way that the 6 ft stroke is reduced to 4 ft stroke for the inclined rods. Each plunger pumps water in two pump chambers with total of six chambers for the pumping engine. With the reduction of the strokes and the relation of diameters, a higher capacity for pressure can be achieved. The efficiency of the engine also comes from the design of the pump valves by Prof. Riedler. The pump valves which are connected rings that can move up and down to open can close the valves. The pump valve mechanism is controlled by a diagonal rod, powered from a 12 ft stroke horizontal rod which is connected the crank.
