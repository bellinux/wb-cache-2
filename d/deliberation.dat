5|$|After {{one hour}} of jury <b>deliberation,</b> Wise {{was found guilty of}} first-degree murder. The jury urged mercy in sentencing, and the judge {{sentence}}d Wise to a life sentence in prison, under the terms of which she could only be freed by executive clemency.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political <b>deliberation.</b> His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal <b>deliberation</b> can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

40|$|Jury <b>deliberations</b> receive {{extensive}} {{protection from}} public examination. These protections make jury <b>deliberations</b> much less {{accessible to the}} public than most other governmental <b>deliberations.</b> This Comment examines the constitutional, common law, and statutory protections for jury <b>deliberations</b> and the dangers that these protections seek to prevent. The Author argues that a limited post-verdict right of access to jury <b>deliberations</b> could restore public faith in the jury and could eventually {{improve the quality of}} jury <b>deliberations.</b> The Author suggests a possible framework that would provide the public with a limited right of access and still address the primary concerns that led to the current protections. The Comment concludes with a postscript addressing the use of audiovisual equipment in the jury room...|$|R

5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans were submitted {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of <b>deliberation</b> and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E
5|$|After much <b>deliberation,</b> Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E

40|$|The {{cooperative}} work process, {{which involves}} <b>deliberations</b> between experts and laity, is restricted by its access to spatial and aspatial information. This paper addresses these concerns {{as to how}} a planning information system can be fashioned to support such <b>deliberations.</b> In particular, by identifying {{the kinds of questions}} that come up in <b>deliberations</b> about institutional knowledge—relationships within {{the current state of the}} world, permissions, intentional changes to the world—tied to locations. Identifying what actions are permitted, prohibited, or have contingencies depends on expert inference that considers overlapping regulations and intentions of other strategic players like governments, their hierarchies (Federal, state, local etc.), developers, and interest groups, in the process. This knowledge necessary in conducting meaningful <b>deliberations</b> is not adequately addressed in systems, including participatory Geographic Information Systems. This paper focusses on specific semantic relationships—complementarity, substitutability, alternatives and interdependence—that need be considered in design of a system that supports <b>deliberations</b> about making plans, using plans and enforcing regulations, among different groups with various levels of expertise...|$|R
5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} absence of any physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of <b>deliberation</b> on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|His law {{practice}} had many influential clients, including Lord Braco and {{the sons of}} Lord Fraser of Lovat. Pitfour was one of 15 advocates acting in a case raised by Alexander Fraser against Lord Fraser claiming the liferents to the Lovat estates. Eventually a compromise was reached; Lovat retained the liferents and Fraser gained a monetary sum instead. As the negotiations had taken many hours of legal <b>deliberation</b> over a three-year period, the case proved very profitable for Pitfour.|$|E
5|$|In the Springtime of the Peoples {{during the}} Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries {{took to the}} streets, many flying the tricolour. Liberals took power and, after {{prolonged}} <b>deliberation,</b> a national assembly was formulated. This Frankfurt Parliament declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deliberations</b> are key {{units of}} {{analysis}} in non-linear, knowledge work. They are 'choice points' that move knowledge work forward. As originated and defined by Cal Pava (1983) in a second-generation development of STS theory, <b>deliberations</b> are patterns of exchange and communication to reduce the equivocality of a problematic issue; for example, for systems engineering work, what features to develop in new software. <b>Deliberations</b> are not discrete decisions--they are a more continuous context for decisions. They have 3 aspects: topics, forums, and participants.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Audrina {{purchases}} {{a home in}} Hermosa Beach, while Stephanie {{begins a}} romantic relationship with Josh. To the surprise of the guests, Brody attended Kristin's farewell party that evening. He confesses that he is saddened by her move, but she maintains that the decision is in her best interest. The next day, after much prior <b>deliberation,</b> Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott's house and begins unpacking her belongings.|$|E
5|$|Nerva's brief reign was {{marred by}} {{financial}} difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir. After some <b>deliberation</b> Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva {{died of natural causes}} on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan.|$|E

5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. After decades of <b>deliberation</b> between an offensive strategy and an accommodative policy, the decision to build the first major Ming walls in the Ordos was agreed upon as an acceptable compromise the 1470s.|$|E

Admiral Wright stuck by his reduced sentences.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its <b>deliberation</b> about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' main goal is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E

Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less than four hours of <b>deliberation,</b> the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
