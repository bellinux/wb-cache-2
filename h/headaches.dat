5|$|A {{migraine}} is {{a primary}} headache disorder characterized by recurrent <b>headaches</b> that are moderate to severe. Typically, the <b>headaches</b> affect {{one half of the}} head, are pulsating in nature, and last from two to 72 hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell. The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{etiology}} of <b>headache</b> in stroke is not known, {{and its relation}} to migraine and tension-type <b>headache</b> is unclear. The aim of our study was to investigate and classify <b>headache</b> appearing in stroke patients prospectively, using the new <b>headache</b> classification as determined by the <b>Headache</b> Classification Committee of the International <b>Headache</b> Society (1988). Methods: Two hundred eighty consecutively admitted patients aged younger than 81 years with acute stroke were examined and questioned about <b>headache</b> and prior <b>headache</b> complaints; 238 (85 %) were able to communicate. Results: Sixty-five (27 %) of the 238 patients experienced <b>headache</b> from 3 days before to 3 days after stroke. <b>Headache</b> occurred in 50 % of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, in 26 % with infarction, and in 15 % of patients with lacunar infarction. <b>Headache</b> was more common when stroke occurred in posterior circulation than anterior circulation (P<. 02). Fifty-six patients were able to give further information about <b>headache</b> characteristics. The <b>headache</b> in thromboembolic stroke was classified as tension-type <b>headache</b> (25 patients), migraine-like <b>headache</b> (14 patients), and other <b>headache</b> (12 patients). Migraine was more frequent in vertebrobasilar stroke. <b>Headache</b> was lateralized in 33 % of cases.

5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down.

40|$|Background. Tinnitus and <b>headache</b> are {{frequent}} disorders. Here, we aimed {{to investigate whether}} the occurrence of <b>headache</b> among tinnitus patients is purely coincidental or whether tinnitus and <b>headache</b> are pathophysiologically linked. We investigated a large sample of patients with tinnitus and <b>headache</b> to estimate prevalence rates of different <b>headache</b> forms, to determine the relationship between tinnitus laterality and <b>headache</b> laterality, and to explore the relationship between tinnitus and <b>headache</b> over time. Method. Patients who presented at a tertiary referral center because of tinnitus and reported comorbid <b>headache</b> {{were asked to complete}} validated questionnaires to determine the prevalence of migraine and tension-type <b>headache</b> and to assess tinnitus severity. In addition, several questions about the relationship between <b>headache</b> and tinnitus were asked. Results. Datasets of 193 patients with tinnitus and <b>headache</b> were analysed. 44. 6 % suffered from migraine, 13 % from tension-type <b>headache,</b> and 5. 7 % from both. <b>Headache</b> laterality was significantly related to tinnitus laterality and in the majority of patients fluctuations in symptom severity of tinnitus and <b>headache</b> were interrelated. Conclusion. These findings suggest a significant relationship between tinnitus and <b>headache</b> laterality and symptom interaction over time and argue against a purely coincidental cooccurrence of tinnitus and <b>headache.</b> Both disorders may be linked by common pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the importance of genetics in tension-type <b>headache.</b> A MEDLINE search from 1966 to December 2006 was performed for “tension-type <b>headache</b> and prevalence ” and “tension-type <b>headache</b> and genetics”. The prevalence of tensiontype <b>headache</b> varies from 11 to 93 %, with a slight female preponderance. Co-occurrence of migraine increases the frequency of tension-type <b>headache.</b> A family study of chronic tension-type <b>headache</b> suggests that genetic factors are important. A twin study analysing tension-type <b>headache</b> in migraineurs found that genetic factors play a minor role in episodic tension-type <b>headache.</b> Another twin study analysing twin pairs without co-occurrence of migraine showed a significantly higher concordance rate among monozygotic than same-gender dizygotic twin pairs with no or frequent episodic tension-type <b>headache,</b> while the difference was minor in twin pairs with infrequent episodic tensiontype <b>headache.</b> Frequent episodic and chronic tension-type <b>headache</b> is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, while infrequent episodic tensiontype <b>headache</b> is caused primarily by environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|Six hundred <b>headache</b> {{patients}} were questioned systematically about factors which precipitated, aggravated or relieved <b>headache,</b> their personal well-being, symptoms of muscular contraction, {{and other features}} thought {{to be associated with}} <b>headache</b> (migraine in the immediate family, ice cream <b>headache,</b> icepick-like pains, symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, travel sickness, and allergies).

Differences between cluster and noncluster <b>headache</b> in age and sex distribution, precipitating and relieving factors, and family history of migraine supported the view that cluster <b>headache</b> is a distinct entity. The results of other analyses emphasized the continuum between migraine, tension-vascular and tension <b>headache.</b> Indications of neurovascular involvement both during and between <b>headache</b> episodes were most apparent toward the migraine end of the <b>headache</b> spectrum, whereas psychological factors and symptoms of muscular contraction were associated more frequently with constant than with episodically-recurring <b>headache...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of primary <b>headache</b> disorders is clinical {{and based on}} the diagnostic criteria of the International <b>Headache</b> Society (ICHD- 3 -beta). However several brain conditions may mimic primary <b>headache</b> disorders and laboratory investigation may be needed. This necessity occurs when the treating physician doubts for the primary origin of <b>headache.</b> Features that represent a warning for a possible underlying disorder causing the <b>headache</b> are new onset <b>headache,</b> change in previously stable <b>headache</b> pattern, <b>headache</b> that abruptly reaches the peak level, <b>headache</b> that changes with posture, <b>headache</b> awakening the patient, or precipitated by physical activity or Valsalva manoeuvre, first onset of <b>headache</b> ≥ 50 years of age, neurological symptoms or signs, trauma, fever, seizures, history of malignancy, history of HIV or active infections, and prior history of stroke or intracranial bleeding. All national <b>headache</b> societies and the European <b>Headache</b> Alliance invited to review and comment the consensus before the final draft. The consensus recommends brain MRI for the case of migraine with aura that persists on one side or in brainstem aura. Persistent aura without infarction and migrainous infarction require brain MRI, MRA and MRV. Brain MRI with detailed study of the pituitary area and cavernous sinus, is recommended for all TACs. For primary cough <b>headache,</b> exercise <b>headache,</b> <b>headache</b> associated with sexual activity, thunderclap <b>headache</b> and hypnic <b>headache</b> apart from brain MRI additional tests may be required.

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic <b>headaches</b> — <b>headaches</b> that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

40|$|<b>Headache</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} reported pain in children and is associated with missed schooldays, anxiety, depressive symptoms and various physical symptoms. A secular trend of increasing <b>headache</b> prevalence has been suggested. Few {{studies have focused on}} tension-type <b>headache</b> among children from the general population. The aims of this thesis were to describe the prevalence, incidence and prognosis of tension-type <b>headache,</b> migraine and overall <b>headache</b> in schoolchildren, to identify medical, psychological and social factors associated with these <b>headache</b> types, and to determine whether the prevalence of <b>headache</b> has increased over the last decades. In 1997, 1850 schoolchildren aged 7 - 15 years from the city of Uppsala participated in a questionnaire study and 1371 (74. 1 %) responded. Out of these, a randomly selected, stratified sample of 131 children and their parents were interviewed. Three years later, 122 children from the interview sample replied to an identical <b>headache</b> questionnaire. Compared with a similar study in 1955, a significantly lower proportion of schoolchildren reported no <b>headache.</b> The prevalence of tension-type <b>headache</b> increased with age and was significantly higher in girls than boys after the age of twelve. Similar age and gender differences were obtained for migraine. A higher proportion of girls reported frequent <b>headache</b> than boys. Children with <b>headache,</b> especially those with migraine, as well as their first-degree relatives suffered from other pains and physical symptoms more frequently than headache-free children and their first-degree relatives. Although the likelihood of experiencing the same <b>headache</b> diagnosis and symptoms at follow-up was high, about one fifth of children with migraine developed tension-type <b>headache</b> and vice versa. Female gender was a predictor of migraine and frequent <b>headache</b> a predictor of overall <b>headache</b> at follow-up. The estimated annual incidence for tension-type <b>headache,</b> migraine and overall <b>headache</b> was 81, 65 and 131 per 1000 children, respectively. In conclusion, the results indicate that <b>headache</b> has become increasingly common among schoolchildren over the last decades. Prevention and treatment of <b>headache</b> is particularly important for girls since they have high prevalence of <b>headache,</b> frequent <b>headache</b> episodes and a poor outcome. In children with <b>headache,</b> diagnoses and treatment should be reassessed regularly and other pains should be asked about and treated as well...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Headache</b> is {{a common}} symptom and {{sometimes}} makes patients worry about stroke. Some stroke patients actually have <b>headache.</b> However, the frequency of <b>headache</b> {{at the onset of}} stroke and the relationship between <b>headache</b> and outcomes are not fully clarified. Objective: The aim of the study is to clarify frequency of <b>headache,</b> and to compare patients with <b>headache</b> with patients without <b>headache</b> in their characteristics, risk factors and early mortalities. Methods: We confirmed {{the presence or absence of}} onset <b>headache</b> in 1671 patients in the Kyoto Stroke Registry. We studied frequencies of <b>headache,</b> age, sex, blood pressure, ar rhythmia, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipemia, to bacco and alcohol use and mortality of stroke pa tients. Results: <b>Headache</b> was observed in 21. 4 % of stroke patients; 12. 0 % in cerebral infarction (CI), 29. 8 % in cerebral hemorrhage (CH), and 93. 9 % in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Blood pressure at the first medical examination after stroke was higher in pati ents with <b>headache.</b> Factors associated with <b>headache</b> were age, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension and hyperlipemia histories, alcohol use, and paresis in CI, age, alcohol and tobacco use and paresis in CH and systolic blood pressure in SAH. The mortality rate 30 days after the stroke event was higher by 6. 8 % in CI and by 11. 4 % in CH in patients with <b>headache</b> than that in patients without <b>headache.</b> The hazard ratios for death between patients with <b>headache</b> and patients without <b>headache</b> were 4. 94 (1. 73 - 14. 08, p = 0. 003) in CI, and 3. 20 (1. 10 - 9. 36, p = 0. 033) in CH. Conclusions: <b>Headache</b> is common in stroke and predicts outcome. <b>Headache</b> is associated with younger age and alcohol use in CI and CH. Patients who could express presence of <b>headache</b> at the onset of CI or CH have higher mortality than patients who could express absence of <b>headache.</b> <b>Headache</b> is important both as an identifier of stroke and as a poor prognostic indicator in stroke. </p...|$|R
