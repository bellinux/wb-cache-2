25|$|A minor {{evolution}} of the preceding One-O-Four, the Majestic, like all new Daimlers following 1937's New Fifteen, was designed around that same massive cruciform-braced box-section chassis equipped with André Girling's design of coil-sprung independent front suspension with a well-located <b>hypoid</b> bevel driven 'live' rear axle using semi-elliptic springs.|$|E
25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing differential, instead of the more common <b>hypoid</b> open differential.|$|E
2500|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or prop shaft) engages the differential through a <b>hypoid</b> gear(ring and pinion). The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. [...] This <b>hypoid</b> gear is a bevel gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|E

2500|$|Gears {{were another}} source of {{considerable}} noise, solved by employing <b>hypoid</b> gears which are mounted at a right angle to the axle, where three of the six teeth constantly engaged the main gear, reducing play and noise. [...] All movable truck parts employed rubber for noise reduction as well. [...] "Satisfactory Cushion Wheel of Vital Importance; Develop New Truck Design; Generous Use of Rubber" [...] are headings within a paper that Chief Engineer Clarence F. Hirshfeld both presented and published.|$|E
2500|$|Model X Duesenbergs {{are very}} rare. It was a sportier {{version of the}} model A with a heavier and longer ( [...] wheelbase) chassis and [...] engine that enabled it to reach [...] The most notable {{differences}} between the A and X were that the latter had <b>hypoid</b> differentials and all its valves were on one side; it sported the hydraulic brakes that Fred had originated on his 1914 racing cars. This braking system could have earned him a fortune if he had obtained a patent.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist automatic transmission fluid (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional <b>hypoid</b> gear oil. This dual circuit lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles. It has a torque handling limit of up to , and engine power outputs of up to [...] It has a total mass, including all lubricants and the dual-mass flywheel of [...]|$|E
50|$|A <b>hypoid</b> {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a <b>hypoid</b> gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the <b>hypoid</b> gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The <b>hypoid</b> gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In <b>hypoid</b> gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The <b>hypoid</b> pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> gears {{are still}} common in larger trucks {{because they can}} {{transmit}} higher torque. A higher <b>hypoid</b> offset allows the gear to transmit higher torque. However increasing the <b>hypoid</b> offset results in reduction of mechanical efficiency and a consequent reduction in fuel economy. For practical purposes, it is often impossible to replace low efficiency <b>hypoid</b> gears with more efficient spiral bevel gears in automotive use because the spiral bevel gear would need a much larger diameter to transmit the same torque. Increasing {{the size of the}} drive axle gear would require an increase {{of the size of the}} gear housing and a reduction in the ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. <b>Hypoid</b> gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between <b>hypoid</b> gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for <b>hypoid)</b> followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of <b>hypoid</b> gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a <b>hypoid</b> does. Bringing <b>hypoid</b> gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hypoid</b> gear {{incorporates}} some sliding and can {{be considered}} halfway between a straight-cut gear and a worm gear. Special gear oils are required for <b>hypoid</b> gears because the sliding action requires effective lubrication under extreme pressure between the teeth.|$|E

50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or prop shaft) engages the differential through a <b>hypoid</b> gear(ring and pinion). The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. This <b>hypoid</b> gear is a bevel gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypoid</b> {{gearings}} {{are used}} in power transmission products that are more efficient than conventional worm gearing. They are considerably stronger in that any load is conveyed through multiple teeth simultaneously. By contrast, bevel gears are loaded through one tooth at a time. The multiple contacts of <b>hypoid</b> gearing, with proper lubrication, can be nearly silent, as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{axle housing}} is a welded {{construction}} made from formed steel. The transaxle used <b>hypoid</b> gears.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypoid</b> {{bevel gears}} {{are similar to}} spiral bevel but the pitch {{surfaces}} are hyperbolic and not conical. Pinion can be offset above, or below,the gear centre, thus allowing larger pinion diameter, and longer life and smoother mesh, with additional ratios e.g., 6:1, 8:1, 10:1. In a limiting case of making the [...] "bevel" [...] surface parallel with the axis of rotation, this configuration resembles a worm drive. <b>Hypoid</b> gears were widely used in automobile rear axles.|$|E
50|$|Most {{lubricants}} for manual gearboxes and differentials contain {{extreme pressure}} (EP) additives and antiwear additives {{to cope with}} the sliding action of <b>hypoid</b> bevel gears.|$|E
50|$|Also {{note that}} the designations right hand and left hand are applied {{similarly}} to other types of bevel gear, <b>hypoid</b> gears, and oblique tooth face gears.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{was also}} new and {{features}} independent torsion bar front suspension and live rear axle with <b>hypoid</b> final drive. The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of <b>hypoid</b> gear {{is that the}} ring gear of the differential and the input pinion gear are both <b>hypoid.</b> In most passenger cars this allows the pinion to be offset {{to the bottom of}} the crown wheel. This provides for longer tooth contact and allows the shaft that drives the pinion to be lowered, reducing the [...] "hump" [...] intrusion in the passenger compartment floor. However, the greater the displacement of the input shaft axis from the crown wheel axis, the lower the mechanical efficiency.|$|E
50|$|In older {{automotive}} designs, <b>hypoid</b> gears {{were typically}} used in rear-drive automobile drivetrains, but modern designs {{have tended to}} substitute spiral bevel gears to increase driving efficiency.|$|E
50|$|API Category GL-4 designates {{the type}} of service {{characteristic}} of spiral-bevel and <b>hypoid</b> gears in automotive axles operated under moderate speeds and loads. These oils {{may be used in}} selected manual transmission and transaxle applications.|$|E
50|$|Salisbury Axle in USA {{was also}} part of the Spicer Group and in 1939 the Salisbury Transmission Company was formed in Britain to {{manufacture}} <b>hypoid</b> rear axles and, in the late 1950s, Powr-Lok limited-slip differentials.|$|E

5000|$|The IIIB, {{launched}} September 1960, {{reverted to}} a single carburettor which improved fuel consumption and facilitated servicing [...] "in remoter territories". The IIIB also received a new back axle featuring a <b>hypoid</b> bevel {{in place of the}} former model's spiral bevel.|$|E
50|$|Rear Differential StructureThe vehicle's {{rear axle}} unit {{does not use}} a {{conventional}} differential. Instead, a <b>hypoid</b> ring-and-pinion gear set supported by a cast-aluminum housing switches torque from the propeller shaft's longitudinal orientation to the lateral orientation necessary to drive the rear wheels.|$|E
