5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected <b>individual.</b> <b>Transmission</b> may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to change the economics of power delivery by allowing increased power flow over existing lines. Synchrophasor data could be used to allow power flow up to a line's dynamic limit instead of to its worst-case limit. Synchrophasor technology will usher in a new process for establishing centralized and selective controls for the flow of electrical energy over the grid. These controls will affect both large scale (multiple-states) and <b>individual</b> <b>transmission</b> line sections at intersecting substations. Transmission line congestion (over-loading), protection, and control will therefore be improved on a multiple region scale (US, Canada, Mexico) through interconnecting ISO's.|$|E

50|$|All <b>individual</b> <b>transmission</b> {{electron}} microscopy images are projections from the three-dimensional {{space of the}} samples into two dimensions (so that spatial distribution information along the projection direction is unavoidably lost). Projections along prominent (i.e. certain low-index) zone axes of 3D crystals or along the layer normal of a membrane forming protein sample ensure the projection of 3D symmetry into 2D. (Along arbitrary high-index zone axes and inclined to the layer normal of membrane forming proteins, {{there will be no}} useful projected symmetry in transmission images.) The recovery of 3D structures and their symmetries relies on electron tomography techniques, which use sets of transmission {{electron microscopy}} images.|$|E

In addition there was a nomenclature change which reverted to the plain name of Ultramatic Drive. This year also saw the selector quadrant undergo yet another change to become: PNHDLR in order to further clarify the two drive ranges and accommodate the soon to be released push button control pod.

50|$|OASIS {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the purchase and availability of transmission from <b>individual</b> <b>transmission</b> providers with a forward-looking time frame, while E-Tag is focused on real-time scheduling and power flow management across multiple systems. Nonetheless, the FERC-derived OASIS applications and NERC-derived E-Tag applications are somewhat duplicative. FERC's plan for the eventual introduction of OASIS Phase 2 envisions a combined platform to post transmission offerings, allow transmission purchases, and facilitate scheduling and flow management, effectively merging the essential functions of E-Tag and OASIS. However, there has been very little activity to move towards OASIS Phase 2 since the introduction of E-Tag 1.7 in 2002, and the future remains unclear. As both systems have increased in complexity over time, the difficulties in merging the two independently evolved systems have likewise also increased.|$|E

5000|$|A {{transmission}} line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse {{equal to the}} power supply voltage V, was invented in 1937 by British engineer Alan Blumlein and is widely used today in PFNs. [...] In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal length {{transmission line}}s, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the righthand line is charged through the impedance of the load). [...] To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits {{the line at the}} power supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance RL, the voltage step is half reflected and half transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite polarity voltage steps which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of V/2 − (−V/2) = V across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2D/c, where D is the length of the <b>individual</b> <b>transmission</b> lines. [...] A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics.|$|E
50|$|Evlutionary {{psychological}} {{accounts of}} culture, especially cultural epidemiology, may seem {{at odds with}} other disciplines in psychology and anthropology, especially research in cultural evolution (e.g. Boyd and Richerson, 1985, 2005). Cultural evolution, the domain of research focused on how culture changes through time due to different <b>individual</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanisms and population-level effects, often uses models derived from population genetics, in which agents are passive recipients of cultural traits (e.g. Bentley et al., 2004). While evolutionary psychology has focused on how behavior may result from species-typical psychological programs which led to greater fitness in ancestral environments, this work {{has been criticized for}} neglecting how behavior may be shaped by culturally transmitted information. In contrast to genetic programs, cultural evolution investigates how culture itself may evolve (Mesoudi, 2009). Gene-culture coevolution studies how culture and genetic evolution influence each other, ultimately shaping behavior, as well. Cultural evolution and evolutionary psychology may not be as disparate as one may think, though. Rather than a passive receptacle of cultural material, Boyd and Richerson (1985, 2005) suggest that our minds consist of psychological mechanisms which direct our attention to and imitate cultural traits depending on the frequency of that trait, the content of it, who carries it, etc. In this way, cultural evolution may be viewed as a particular kind of “scaling up” from the individual-level processes to population-level ones. In neither account of culture is the mind a blank slate or empty bin for cultural material (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). Some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that culturally-transmitted culture may pass through a number of lenses and filters shaped by natural selection to catch fitness-relevant information and behaviors; these filters may change due to local environmental conditions, sex, and other factors (Gangestad et al., 2006). Boyer (2000) argued that evolutionary psychology, and anthropology in general, should investigate how these cognitive predispositions to cultural material affect their representation in following generations. This research program may help to unify the two fields (Boyer, 2000). Others have suggested that evolutionary psychology, human behavioral ecology, and cultural evolution all fit nicely with each other, ultimately answering different questions on human behavioral diversity; gene-culture coevolution may be at odds with other research programs though by placing more emphasis on socially-learned behavior and its influence on human evolution (Brown et al., 2011).|$|E

The concatenated hybrid ARQ scheme we propose combines the advantages of both type-I and type-II hybrid ARQ schemes. Certain error correction capability is provided in each (re) transmitted packet, and the information can be recovered from each transmission or retransmission alone if the errors are within the error correction capability (similar to type-I hybrid ARQ). The retransmitted packet contains redundancy bits which, when combined with the previous transmission, result in a more powerful RS/convolutional concatenated code to recover information if error correction fails for the <b>individual</b> <b>transmissions</b> (similar to type-II hybrid ARQ) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} a {{small-scale}} power network incorporating four generators is investigated in this paper. The small-signal dynamic characteristics and control system performance are assessed using individual channel analysis and design (ICAD). ICAD is motivated through the {{need to understand the}} effect of system interaction on both the control design task and robustness. System interaction on <b>individual</b> <b>transmissions</b> is explicitly considered through the use of multivariable structure functions which, although scalar, encapsulate the multivariable nature of the system. The strength of such an approach is that highly successful single-input single-output classical control techniques such as Nyquist/Bode can be used without loss of multivariable information. For the example network, ICAD enables the design of the individual controllers to be performed independently of one another and determines that the effect of system interaction is not detrimental to network stability. It therefore potentially provides a strong platform for consideration of large-scale networks with embedded generation. Finally, the ICAD network control analysis an...|$|R
