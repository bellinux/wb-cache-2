500|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{with the remaining}} 25,000 being sent out to other clubs. 17,500 of those tickets were available to Southampton season ticket holders. Seat prices for the final exceeded £80, with the cheapest tickets available at £25. Southampton was given the South Stand, which was the larger end of the stadium, whereas Arsenal was situated at the opposite end. Although Southampton supporters were disappointed at the allocation share, chairman Rupert Lowe refused to criticise the FA's decision, by saying: [...] "The reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>too</b> {{many people want to}} go and there are never enough tickets." [...] In the lead up to the final, the South Wales Echo reported that many tickets were being sold on the black market, for [...] "20 times" [...] the face-value price.|$|E
500|$|Oolong tea: This tea's {{oxidation}} {{is stopped}} {{somewhere between the}} standards for green tea and black tea. The processing typically takes {{two to three days}} from withering to drying with a relatively short oxidation period of several hours. In Chinese, semi-oxidized teas are collectively grouped as blue tea (青茶, literally: blue-green tea / [...] "celadon tea"), while the term [...] "oolong" [...] is used specifically as a name for certain semi-oxidized teas. Common wisdom about lightly oxidized teas in Taiwan (a large producer of Oolong) <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>too</b> little oxidation upsets the stomach of some consumers. Even so, some producers attempt to minimize oxidation in order to produce a specific taste or allow the tea leaves to be easily rolled into the spherical or half-sphere form demanded by buyers in the market.|$|E
2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>too</b> much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{views about}} student participation in extracurricular activities. A predominant {{position is that}} colleges were after [...] "well-rounded bodies of individual specialists", suggesting {{that it is better}} for a student to be deeply involved in one or two activities rather than nine or ten superficially, such as a [...] "violin-playing quarterback" [...] or a [...] "math-medalist poet," [...] and that students should not [...] "overdo it" [...] and that parents should not become overconcerned about their child's extracurricular activities. Applicants who achieve a leadership position in an extracurricular activity are regarded more highly than applicants who merely participate in a bunch of activities. Advisors recommend that a student should choose which extracurricular activities they genuinely care about, pursue them with [...] "gusto" [...] and [...] "joyful commitment" [...] that demonstrates integrity and commitment. And, consistent with this view, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>too</b> many extracurricular activities may look suspect to admissions officers, particularly if it seems unreasonable that any person could be as active and succeed scholastically at the same time. Jobs are generally viewed favorably by admissions committees, including even part-time service jobs such as flipping hamburgers, since it suggests that a student has learned to handle time management, to accept responsibility, and develop people skills. A less dominant position was that it is helpful to be involved in a [...] "variety of activities", including jobs, internships, and community service. Some universities, such as the University of California, have formal programs for spot-checking applications for accuracy, such as sending a follow-up letter to the student asking for proof about an extracurricular activity or summer job. Advisors recommend that extracurricular activities should never interfere with a student's overall academic performance. A student with many extracurricular activities in twelfth grade, but few in preceding years, particularly when the essays focus on the extracurricular activities, is suspect; this suggests an applicant is being coached, and may reflect negatively on an application. Advisors warn against [...] "overscheduling" [...] students with too many activities or courses.|$|E
