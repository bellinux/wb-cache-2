30|$|For {{each set}} of experiments, 50 mg of sample was well {{distributed}} on the hairless abdominal skin area of approximately 3.14 cm 2. At a fixed time after application, surplus sample {{was removed from the}} skin surface, and the skin surface was washed three times with PBS and dried gently under cold wind with an <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> <b>drier.</b> A 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm skin piece was cut out from the treated area, embedded in OCT and frozen rapidly by liquid nitrogen. The specimen, taken out from liquid nitrogen, was frozen on a metal block. The metal block was then transferred into a cryostat microtome (LE ICACM 1850, Germany) for slicing the vertical cross-sections of skin. Twelve vertical skin sections with a thickness of 25 μm were obtained and stored at 4 °C until microscopy analysis.|$|R

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>hair</b> {{clippers}} {{have gradually}} displaced manual <b>hair</b> clippers. Today, <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> clippers {{are used by}} {{the vast majority of}} barbers in industrialized countries.All of these companies offer <b>electric</b> <b>hair</b> clippers in differing grades from bargain consumer units to high-end professional units. Most consumer grade clippers are intended for personal use by individual consumers and are often sold in kits which include several accessories such as clipper guides (for adjusting the length of the cut). Professional units are intended for hair care professionals and often are sold without any accessories (which must be ordered separately). The quality difference between the consumer grade and professional grade electric clippers has narrowed significantly over the years. Today the primary difference between the two grades is usually added or enhanced insulating for internal electrical components to prevent the unit from heating up during periods of prolonged usage. Some companies, such as Conair and Andis, replace some plastic parts in consumer grade units with metal parts on their professional grade units to extend the durability and useful lifespan of the product. Some companies, such as Wahl Clipper, produce specialty clippers, such as the Trim n Vac, which are designed for ease of use at home.|$|R

40|$|Inspired by {{the recent}} {{proposal}} of soft hair on black holes in Hawking et al (2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 231301), we have shown that an isolated horizon carries soft hairs implanted by electromagnetic fields. The solution space and the asymptotic symmetries of Einstein-Maxwell theory have been worked out explicitly near the isolated horizon. The conserved current has been computed and {{an infinite number of}} near horizon charges have been introduced from the electromagnetic fields associated with the asymptotic U(1) symmetry near the horizon, which indicates the fact that the isolated horizon carries a large amount of soft <b>electric</b> <b>hairs.</b> The soft <b>electric</b> <b>hairs,</b> i. e. asymptotic U(1) charges, are shown to be equivalent to the electric multipole moments of isolated horizons. It is further argued that the isolated horizon supertranslation is from the ambiguity of its foliation and an analogue of memory effect on horizon can be expected.
