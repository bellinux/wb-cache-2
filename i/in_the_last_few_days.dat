5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their demands in writing.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{prompting}} by {{the news}} media, Stilwell never complained about his treatment by Washington or by Chiang. He later served as Commander of Army Ground Forces, U.S. Tenth Army commander <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, and as U.S. Sixth Army commander after the war's conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In September, polls {{indicated}} that the vote would be closer than was indicated earlier. On 6 September a YouGov poll gave those in favour 47% versus 45% for those against; excluding those undecided, the figures were 51% and 49%, respectively. The final polls, taken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of the campaign, indicated a lead for No of 4–6%. There was no exit poll; instead, soon after polling stations had closed, YouGov released a final poll that had been taken during the day of voting, indicating 46% Yes, 54% No.|$|E

25|$|On 17 July 1811, Martínez sent 850 prisoners {{out of the}} {{fortress}} without insisting on an exchange. The starved men reported to the besiegers that they had received almost no food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before their release. The Spanish, however, kept Guillot and his officers as useful hostages. MacDonald took this {{as a sign that}} the Spanish might swiftly surrender, but Martínez held out until mid-August. The Spanish commander knew about the Tarragona catastrophe and realized relief was hopeless but he determined to hang on until the last moment. By mid-August, the defenders had eaten every horse, dog, and rat and had only three days of food left.|$|E
25|$|Early {{on in the}} campaign, {{polls showed}} the Liberals with a solid 5-10 point lead over the Conservatives, and poised to form a strong {{minority}} government at worst. Around Christmas, after reports of an RCMP investigation into allegations of insider trading within the Finance department, this situation changed dramatically, leading to the opposition parties to consistently attack the Liberals on corruption. Almost at the same time, the Boxing Day shooting, an unusually violent gun fight between rival gangs on December 26 in downtown Toronto (resulting {{in the death of}} 15-year-old Jane Creba, an innocent bystander), may have swayed some Ontario voters to support the more hardline CPC policies on crime. The Conservatives enjoyed a fairly significant lead in polls leading up to the election, but the gap narrowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a Year of Thirteen Moons (In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden, 1978) is Fassbinder most {{personal}} and bleakest work. The film follows the tragic life of Elvira, a transsexual {{formerly known as}} Erwin. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before her suicide, she decides to visit some of the important people and places in her life. In one sequence, Elvira wanders through the slaughterhouse where she worked as Erwin, recounting her history amid the meat-hooked corpses of cattle whose slit throats rain blood onto the floor. In another scene, Elvira returns to the orphanage where she was raised by nuns and hears the brutal story of her childhood. Fassbinder's camera tracks the nun (played by his mother) telling Elvira's story; she moves {{with a kind of}} military precision through the grounds, recounting the story in blazing detail, unaware that Elvira had collapsed and can no longer hear it.|$|E

25|$|After {{the males}} have arrived to the beach, the females arrive to give birth. Females fast {{for five weeks}} and nurse their single pup for four weeks; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of lactation, females come into estrus and mate. In this {{polygynous}} society, a high-ranking bull can have a harem of 30–100 cows, depending on his size and strength. Males unable to establish harems will wait on the periphery, and will try to mount nearby females. Dominant bulls will disrupt copulations of lower-ranking bulls. They can mount females without interference, but commonly break off to chase off rivals. While fights are not usually to the death, they are brutal and often with significant bloodshed and injury; however, in many cases of mismatched opponents, the younger, less capable males are simply chased away, often to upland dunes. In a lifetime, a successful bull could easily sire over 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by {{only a small number}} of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls.|$|E
25|$|Some {{money went}} to Vysotsky, {{the rest was}} {{distributed}} amongst this circle. At first this was a reasonable return on their efforts; however, as his addiction progressed and his body developed resistance, the frequency and amount of drugs needed to keep Vysotsky going became unmanageable. This culminated {{at the time of}} the Moscow Olympics which coincided with the last days of his life, when supplies of drugs were monitored more strictly than usual, and some of the doctors involved in supplying Vysotsky were already behind bars (normally the doctors had to account for every ampule, thus drugs were transferred to an empty container, while the patients received a substitute or placebo instead). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> Vysotsky became uncontrollable, his shouting could be heard all over the apartment building on Malaya Gruzinskaya St. where he lived amongst VIP's. Several days before his death, in a state of stupor he went on a high speed drive around Moscow in an attempt to obtain drugs and alcohol – when many high-ranking people saw him. This increased the likelihood of him being forcibly admitted to hospital, and the consequent danger to the circle supplying his habit. As his state of health declined, and it became obvious that he may die, his associates gathered to decide what to do with him. They came up with no firm decision. They did not want him admitted officially, as his drug addiction would become public and they would fall under suspicion, although some of them admitted that any ordinary person in his condition would have been admitted immediately.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of December 18, Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville, Virginia, {{in an effort to}} stem Stoneman's advance. Taking the regular troops with him, Breckinridge left Col. Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works. Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of the main force and ordered them to harass the Union forces. At about 3 a.m., Breckinridge and his small company began to cross Walkers Mountain. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> before the march, [...] of rain had fallen, leaving the roads muddy and travel difficult.

It also revealed that it had received a censored report by the Canadian government on human rights in Afghanistan through an access to information request, and it contained [...] "negative references to acts such as torture, abuse, and extra judicial killings [...] were blacked out without an explanation." [...] This prompted intensive questioning in the House, to which O'Connor claimed that a new agreement had been reached, saying [...] "we have, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> entered into a local agreement in the Kandahar province to enter the detention facilities any time we want." [...] This would be reaffirmed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, stating that there was [...] "no evidence that access is blocked to the prisons", and that Afghan authorities had agreed to [...] "formalize that agreement {{so there is no}} potential misunderstanding." [...] Regardless, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced that the Afghan government was to launch an inquiry about the fate of detainees. In January 2008, it was revealed that the government ceased the detainee transfers after an internal investigation revealed allegations of a detainee being abused on 5 November 2007.|$|E
500|$|Unbeknownst to the Fringe team, September has {{engineered}} several events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> including stopping {{an armed}} robbery {{to help the}} asthmatic female employee (Olivia Cheng) recover from an asthma attack, taking her inhaler. When Walter hears of this witness, he requests Peter and Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) to bring her to his lab, believing her {{to be related to}} the Observer's warning. Minutes from the lab, September rams the car in which the woman is being transported, initiating another asthma attack. September races from the scene, prompting Peter to follow him in Walter's car, requesting Walter to [...] "give me the keys and save the girl." [...] Walter realizes that September has been orchestrating the events leading up to this point and urges Peter not to go, believing that following the advice of the Observer might lead to Peter's death. Walter eventually relents and returns to help the woman, creating a makeshift inhaler before emergency help arrives. Meanwhile, Peter and Olivia follow the Observer to a rooftop. Peter corners September, who says [...] "It must be very difficult, being a father", before he shoots Peter with an energy blast that knocks him off his feet. Olivia arrives in time to give chase to the Observer but September disappears from an adjacent rooftop.|$|E

2500|$|After {{preliminary}} hearings during 2000, the inquest {{began in}} April 2001 {{with an initial}} estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks. The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: [...] "For anyone else {{it would be a}} tantrum, for me it's just raising my voice." [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> of Hancock's life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his will and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her.

Hathorn said that he had expected Byars to wage [...] "some kind of challenge [...] we didn't push the petition in any way", followed the proper legal procedures, and relied on voluntary efforts.
