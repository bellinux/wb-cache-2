500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While {{some of the}} Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the [...] "pivotal moment that changed everything", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show. [...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E

The film's score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray disc, and vinyl record. A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.|$|E
2500|$|When Jack Swigert {{is getting}} ready to dock with the LM, a {{concerned}} NASA technician says: [...] "If Swigert can't dock this thing, we don't have a mission." [...] Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was really worried about whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the job, but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Oleg Riabov, {{a fellow}} {{academic}} and publisher, commissioned Moskvin to summarize and list {{the dead in}} more than 700 cemeteries in forty regions of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. Moskvin claimed to have gone on foot to inspect 752 cemeteries across the region from 2005 to 2007, walking up to 30km (18.6 miles) a day. During these travels, he drank from puddles, spent nights in haystacks and at abandoned farms, or slept in the cemeteries themselves, even {{going so far as}} to spend a night in a coffin being prepared for a funeral. Moskvin also claimed that on his extensive travels he was sometimes questioned by police on the suspicion of vandalism and theft, but that he was never arrested or reprimanded. The work itself remains unpublished but has been described as [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "priceless" [...] by Alexei Yesin, the editor of Necrologies, a weekly paper to which Moskvin was a regular contributor. After Moskvin's arrest, Yesin stated that he was confident that there had been a mistake and Moskvin would soon be exonerated. He also told the Associated Press that Moskvin was a loner who had [...] "certain quirks" [...] but who had given no indication that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> anything unusual.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her divorce}} from Nick and his {{marriage}} to Phyllis, Sharon moved on by marrying a rival to the Newman family, Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Bergman {{said that it was}} [...] "only appropriate" [...] that the couple found each other, explaining: [...] "Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack." [...] However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her [...] "all happens so quickly" [...] which could indicate <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had [...] "lost her identity" [...] after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a [...] "needy" [...] "gum-chewing twit" [...] who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: [...] "He [...] Freaks. She wrote this scathing thing. But Nick says it's not appropriate for her to go after the mother of his son like that," ...|$|E
2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
