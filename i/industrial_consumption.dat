25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. <b>Industrial</b> <b>consumption</b> of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E

25|$|As Japan's oil {{reserves}} were rapidly depleted by the ongoing {{military operations in}} China as well as <b>industrial</b> <b>consumption,</b> {{in the latter half}} of 1941, the Japanese began preparing a military response to secure vital resources if diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation failed. As a part of this process, the Japanese planners determined a broad scheme of manoeuvre that incorporated simultaneous attacks on the British and the United States. This would see landings in Malaya and Hong Kong as part of a general move south to secure Singapore, which was connected to Malaya by the Johor–Singapore Causeway, and then an invasion of the oil-rich area of Borneo and Java in the Dutch East Indies. In addition, strikes would be made against the United States naval fleet at Pearl Harbor, as well as landings in the Philippines, and attacks on Guam, Wake Island and the Gilbert Islands. Following these attacks, a period of consolidation was planned, after which the Japanese planners intended to build up the defences of the territory that had been captured by establishing a strong perimeter around it stretching from the India–Burma frontier through to Wake Island, and traversing Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea and New Britain, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall and Gilbert Islands. With this perimeter, it was intended to block Allied attempts to regain the lost territory and defeat their will to fight.|$|E

40|$|While {{previous}} studies have examined China’s changing <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption</b> at the national level, this study argues {{that it is more}} useful, from a policy standpoint, to conduct a regional-level analysis owing to the significant regional disparity in industrialisation in the country. This study focuses particularly on Northeast China, where the implementation of the Northeast Revitalisation Strategy in 2003 has contributed to rapid reindustrialisation, which has a serious implication for <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> We decompose the region’s energy consumption changes into activity, structure, and intensity effects. Our results show that the intensity effect is not the only negative factor impacting <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption</b> during 2003 – 2012. The structure effect also has a negative impact on <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption</b> between 2005 and 2012. However, the negative impact of the two factors is weakening and not strong enough to counter the positive impact of the activity effect. This result highlights the problem of uncoordinated policy-making in Northeast China. The development strategy, which still depends highly on traditional heavy industries, is in conflict with the national strategy of energy conservation. The two conflicting objectives of industrial revitalization and energy conservation must be reconciled for sustainability in the long term. The study concludes with policy recommendations on how to achieve such reconciliation...|$|R

This study describes a method to establish a GHGs emissions inventory in Chinese cities for 6 emission sources including <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> transportation, household energy consumption, commercial energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>industrial</b> processes and waste.

40|$|The energy {{balances}} {{published by}} the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{are one of the}} most valuable sources of energy statistics covering world energy supply and demand. However, some issues arise when these data are analyzed or used directly. Even when <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption</b> alone is examined, at least three types of issues are encountered: missing data, large amounts of misallocated data in some countries, and numerous unrealistic outliers in the time-series variations. When we deal with only a few regions, we can look at data one by one and modify them. In this case, we are going to overcome these issues with a systematic method because the data covers world including more than a hundred regions. This paper proposes a data reconciliation method to treat these issues, and describes its application to world <b>industrial</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> As a result of its application, we found that the three issues mentioned above seemed to be overcome. The degree of the reconciliation by region showed that OECD countries' degree tends to be smaller than those of non-OECD countries.
