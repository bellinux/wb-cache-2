25|$|A career-spanning {{series of}} battles with Tie Domi of the New York Rangers, Winnipeg Jets and Toronto Maple Leafs.

25|$|The {{series against}} Sri Lanka had started in Perth with {{speculation}} regarding Waugh's four consecutive Test ducks. After four hours, Waugh reached his century {{and ended with}} 111 to end his run of ducks. On reaching his century, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> {{a section of the}} crowd who had been heckling him. Australia won by an innings and Waugh then scored 61 in another innings victory in the Second Test at Melbourne. He was batting when off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was repeatedly no-balled for throwing by Darrell Hair, before being bowled by the spinner. Waugh scored 71 in the Third Test and ended with 255 runs at 63.75 in a series clean sweep.|$|E
500|$|Having found a {{place in}} India's Test squad for the tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against Cricket Australia Chairman's XI to {{strengthen}} his case for {{a spot in the}} playing eleven ahead of Rohit Sharma. Batting at number six, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests as his defensive technique was exposed. While fielding on the boundary during {{the second day of the}} second match, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top-scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth, with 44 and 75, even as India surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an Indian in the series. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series, was described as [...] "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".|$|E

Lilly enters the building, and finds the other Brother, a dead woman, and a baby. The Brother tells Lilly the infant is the first female vampire ever born. The virus has created her and she is truly the first Perfect Creature.|$|R

500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just stood beside Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride.

500|$|Art {{historian}} Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and {{unsure of}} himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. He has a very young face, and seems barely in his teens, with a gawky face, which according to Friedländer [...] "forms a strange contrast to the aged, ponderous canon". George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet while simultaneously presenting the donor, and [...] "this seems to embarrass him". George is the only figure whose feet are exposed. The uncertain manner in which <b>he</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> the Virgin gives {{the impression of a}} shy and uncertain nature; and he raises his helmet in a hesitant manner. Friedländer observes that George's head is slightly inclined, his face [...] "twisted into an empty smile".|$|R

5000|$|On {{the third}} inbound try, McMillen was again {{assigned}} {{to use his}} height to challenge Edeshko's inbound pass. However, as official Artenik Arabadjian prepared to put the ball into play, <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> McMillen. McMillen responded by backing several feet away from Edeshko, which gave Edeshko a clear view and unobstructed path to throw a long pass down the court. McMillen later said that Arabadjian had instructed him {{to back away from}} Edeshko. McMillen said that despite {{the fact that there was}} no rule which would require him to do so, he decided to comply, fearing that if he did not, Arabadjian might assess a technical foul against him. [...] For his part, Arabadjian has denied that his gesture was intended to instruct McMillen to back away from Edeshko. Judging from the television footage, Arabadjian's intention was to indicate the plane of the baseline that McMillen must not cross while contesting the inbounds pass.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the wake}} of {{ecological}} crises, {{there has been a}} resurgence of interest in the relation between dialectical thought and nature. The work of Herbert Marcuse and Murray Bookchin offers unique approaches to this question that remain highly relevant. In {{the first half of the}} article, we engage with Marcuse’s application of the dialectical method in which <b>he</b> <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> the “vital need ” to push beyond the appearance of “the real ” and yet lamented the loss of the ability for negative thinking to pierce the dominance of the “technical apparatus ” that tied humanity to this “radical falsity”. Here, we suggest the need for a more holistic dialectical understanding of the social totality— one that is directly located within, and takes as foundational, the environmental condi-tions of human society. In the second half, we examine Murray Bookchin’s conception of “dialectical naturalism ” as a more thorough engagement with the human/nature rela-tion that surpasses Marcuse’s late engagements with ecologism. In particular, we offer critical reflections on the concept of “nature ” in the contemporary ecology movement and illustrate how dialectical naturalism is capable of not only transcending dualistic conceptions of “man/nature ” but in expanding our awareness of the potentialities of history along what Bookchin terms the “libertory pathways ” to a restorative relation between human “second nature ” and biological “first nature”. We posit that systemic, interconnected and accelerating ecological crises (climatic, biospheric and oceanic) form the objective and absolute contradiction of contemporary global social life that compels an awareness of the potentialities of an ecological society. Only through this awareness can we break through the reified “solutions ” that have often plagued the ecology move-ment, bringing about the urgent social and ecological transformation that our species requires for its liberation and long-term survival...|$|E

50|$|Arabic {{coffee is}} usually served {{just a few}} centiliters at a time. The waiter/host serves the guest just {{enough to cover the}} bottom of the cup. Usually, the coffee is boiling hot, so larger amounts would take too long to cool to a {{drinkable}} temperature. The guest drinks it and if he wishes, <b>he</b> will <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> the waiter not to pour any more. Otherwise, the host/waiter will continue to serve another few centilitres at a time until the guest indicates he has had enough. The most common practice is to drink only one cup since serving coffee serves as a ceremonial act of kindness and hospitality. Sometimes people also drink larger volumes during conversations.|$|R
