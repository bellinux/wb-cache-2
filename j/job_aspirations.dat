This study investigated factors that might influence the career aspirations of children across a broad age spectrum. Students (N= 150) from grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 completed questionnaires which assessed their <b>job</b> <b>aspirations,</b> their reasons for wanting a particular job, and their expectations for achieving their career goal. Subjects also completed the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Parents of the students completed questionnaires on their aspirations and expectations for their child's career goals and provided information on their own occupation, income level, and education level. Regression analyses were employed to correlate variables with one another. Analyses revealed four variables as significant predictors of the subjects' job aspirations: sex of the student, parent's job aspiration for the student, family income level, and mother's occupation. Student self-conc. ept did not significantly predict <b>job</b> <b>aspirations</b> for all subjects. Analyses of each age and sex separately indicated varied and interesting patterns of results.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how work and family aspirations relate to occupational achievements and gender differences herein. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 2009 the authors examined the relationship between career and childrearing aspirations and occupational achievements of Dutch parents. Using path modeling in Mplus, the authors investigated both direct and indirect pathways where aspirations were related to occupational achievements via time allocations. Findings: The authors found that ranking being promoted instead of a non-career aspiration as the most important job aspiration was positively related to occupational achievements. Surprisingly, the authors also found that ranking childrearing as the most important life role aspiration was positively related to earnings among fathers. Research limitations/implications: Investigating aspirations in multiple domains simultaneously can provide new information on working parents' occupational achievements. Practical implications: The results imply that parents who want to achieve an authority position or high earnings may need to prioritize their promotion aspiration among their <b>job</b> <b>aspirations</b> in order to increase the likelihood of achieving such a position. Moreover, this is likely to require sacrifices outside the work domain, since spending more time on paid work is an important way to achieve this aspiration.

Jobs are categorised as having no, low, medium or high social interaction. A priori wage differences may be positive or negative, depending on preferences and productivity effects. The following shortcomings remain. First, interactivity at the working place is measured at the occupational, not at the individual level. Second, if discrimination at the level of occupations exists, then wage differentials may stem from discrimination as well. To solve these two related issues, better data are needed which are left for future research. Third, we are also not able to tackle the simultaneity issue in our econometric analysis with adults. To get some idea about the bias, we provide additional evidence for the sorting equations by utilising data from not working juveniles on their <b>job</b> <b>aspirations.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary: Hendrik Verwoerd, one of {{the main}} architects of “Bantu {{education}} “and the idea of independent Bantu homelands, is {{one of the}} most controversial politicians in South Africa. Hailed and almost venerated by his supporters, he was seen by Albert Luthuli and other African nationalists as the architect of their “calamity”. In popular journalism he has been likened to Adolf Hitler and Robert Mugabe. Yet Verwoerd was no conventional racist. Recent research has shown that as a Stellenbosch lecturer he rejected the theory that some races were genetically and biologically superior to others. When he went abroad he was not attracted to Nazi thinking but by the ideas of American social scientists who advocated “social engineering” to avoid future conflicts. His main aim in introducing Bantu education in 1954 was to expand mass education on a primary level and to deflect black <b>job</b> <b>aspirations</b> from the cities to the homelands. His plan to impose a rigid form of apartheid was ultimately thwarted by high economic growth and much more rapid black population growth than had been anticipated...|$|E

The study further aimed at finding out how their vocational aspirations are influenced. An exploratory case study design was used and it comprised of two sub studies. Sub study 1 was quantitative in nature and it constituted of a survey. Questionnaires were used in the survey to collect information from the participants. Sub study 2 was qualitative in nature and it employed individual interviews. A purposively selected sample was drawn from five schools across four provinces of Kenya. Altogether a total of 79 male and female learners with visual impairments participated in the survey. 12 learners with visual impairments were purposively selected for individual interviews. The interviewees were also drawn from the five schools across the four provinces. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics; frequencies and percentages. Qualitative data was analysed in terms of categories and subcategories. Some variation was noted based on gender and degree of vision among the participants. Findings of the study indicate that learners with visual impairments have relatively high educational and vocational aspirations.

First, there are identified nine variables that can affect their position on the labor market. Analysis of these variables leads to its subsequent division into two groups - individual and objective. In the context of individual variables, the focus is on a financial and material situation, support of wider family, <b>job</b> <b>aspirations</b> and a need for harmonization of work and personal life of single mothers. As objective variables is dealt with the social and family policy, possibilities of preschool and school facilities, access of an employer in terms of using a family-friendly approach and a risk of discrimination, a risk of unemployment. The subsequent empirical survey with the qualitative design utilizes personal experiences of single mothers from their activity on the labor market in the context of selected variables.

The panel was used to enquire about, and track the realisation of, <b>job</b> <b>aspirations</b> of young people born in the early 1980 s and entering the workforce in the 2000 s. The study compared the aspirations of young people growing up in socio-economically disadvantaged areas with those growing up in non-disadvantaged areas. The analysis confirmed strong differences in the occupational preferences and choices of young people in these two types of areas. Young people in disadvantaged areas more often sought manual occupations, often following their parents’ example; they {{were also more likely to}} become unemployed, reflecting economic tertiarisation and decreasing availability of manual jobs in those areas. However, the study also found evidence of young people from disadvantaged areas using repeated changes in jobs to achieve employment in higher-level occupations, which was related to greater job satisfaction. The same was not the case for young people in non-disadvantaged areas. The research demonstrated that growing up in disadvantaged areas did not prevent the proactive construction of career biographies per se, but it required greater effort, exposing additional barriers to job satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{increasing}} differentiation which affects every kind of socialisation process, that of gender divisions appears as an issue of great importance, although it’s difficult to read. During the adolescent phase of growth, and parti-cularly among students, we can talk of a double situation. On the one hand, observing daily life, young people seem to adopt certain uniform behaviour (i. e. in dressing, eating, consumer styles), as if they ignore their gender belonging. Al-so the school organisation seems indifferent to the student’s (and teacher’s) gender, acting mainly under the “equality” principle that is, to avoid discrimination between females and males in education. On the other hand, if we analyse so-me statistics in education, it is easy to grasp how the gender differences influence a number of factors, such as school choice, school results, motivation to study and <b>job</b> <b>aspirations,</b> which will condition the future achievement goals of the young, in terms of social opportunities and well being. A recent inquiry in Northern Italy (carried out last winter in Lombardy) provides a series of data, which I use to describe how adolescents (14 - 15 aged) perceive and put under fo-cus their gender belonging and, more generally, gender differentiation; how differently females and males describe their school experience (particularly their relationship with fellows and teachers), and which are the main gender-linked fac-tors affecting their choice of secondary school...|$|E

Relevant to the workplace, stereotype threat can reduce domain identification, <b>job</b> engagement, career <b>aspirations,</b> and receptivity to feedback. Stereotype threat has consequences in other relevant domains including leadership, entrepreneurship, negotiations, and competitiveness. Several institutional and individual level intervention strategies that have been field-tested and are easy to implement show promise for practitioners including: addressing environmental cues, valuing diversity, wise feedback, organizational mindsets, reattribution training, reframing the task, values-affirmation, utility-value, belonging, communal goal affordances, interdependent worldviews, and teaching about stereotype threat. This review integrates criticisms and evidence into one accessible source for practitioners and provides recommendations for implementing effective, low-cost interventions in the workplace...|$|R
50|$|The film {{is set in}} Karlstad. Frizzy-haired Janos (Sven-Olof Molin) {{is already}} mid-aged but has no <b>jobs</b> and no <b>aspirations.</b> He sings ballads {{on the street with}} a guitar and picks the garbage for food, yet he is content with his {{carefree}} life. He sometimes helps out old man Stig Manner (Rolf G. Ekroth) who walks with a cane to sell used goods. Obviously unsatisfied with Janos' lack of achievements, Stig tries hard to launch a musical career for him. He calls himself Janos' manager and takes Janos to different places for performing and recording opportunities, but Janos is completely disinterested which frustrates him. Around this time, Stig receives a voice mail from his estranged daughter Catrin (Helena Bengtsson), who has arrived in town from Stockholm with her infant son. Stig is afraid to meet his daughter, but sends her a CD with Janos' recordings. He has a stroke and becomes wheelchair-bound. Janos discovers Stig has a daughter who only wants to meet Stig to introduce him to her son. He puts Stig on a train to Stockholm and calls Catrin.|$|R

In other words, does the happiness of nations depend on its entrepreneurs? And what about happy nations – are they better places for entrepreneurs to start‐up new businesses? In this paper we survey the literature on entrepreneurship and happiness, and use various data sources, primarily from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, to find tentative evidence of an inverse U‐shape relationship between entrepreneurship and national happiness We also find a bi‐directional causality between entrepreneurship and happiness on a country level On an individual level however, national happiness is {{found to have a}} negative effect on the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. We conclude that entrepreneurship may make nations happier, but as nations become happier, their need and imperative for entrepreneurship seems to decline. Hence, not everybody should become entrepreneurs and the happiness of a nation cannot be –indefinitely increased by increasing the numbers of entrepreneurs. Happiness, life and <b>job</b> satisfaction, self‐employment, <b>aspirations,</b> development, Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, double‐probit estimator. ...|$|R
