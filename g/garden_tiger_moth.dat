25|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> is now {{protected}} in the UK under the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). Its {{numbers in the}} UK have declined by 89% over the past 30 years. The BAP in 2007 added the <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> to its list of species in need of habitat protection {{in light of these}} recent declines in suitable habitat. The plan aims to provide greater habitat protection and conservation, with the hopes of stabilizing the A. caja populations that remain in the UK.|$|E
25|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> has a {{wingspan}} of 45 to 65 millimeters (1.8 to 2.6 in). The {{design of}} the wings varies; the front wings are brown with a white pattern (which is sometimes missing), the back wings are orange with a pattern of black dots. There are many aberrations (pattern and colour variants), partly obtained artificially and partly by chance. Oberthür mentions about 500 different variants shown in 36 figures. Seitz gives an account of some named aberrations.|$|E
2500|$|Adult <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> exhibit clear warning signals, {{which they}} share with other <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> to {{advertise}} very real toxicity upon consumption. Adults can also spray an irritating compound when threatened. The chemical, produced in glands that are exposed when threatened, is a choline ester. A similar compound {{is found in}} the tissues of the adults, with the eggs, gonads, and abdomens having the highest concentrations.|$|R
40|$|Defensive fluids {{obtained}} from the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger,</b> Scarlet <b>Tiger</b> and Burnet <b>Moths</b> and from the Monarch Butterfly and the Seven-Spot Ladybird Beetle, haemolymphs taken from the wasp, the Burying Beetle and the Rat Flea, and fluids from the eggs of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger,</b> Gypsy <b>Moth</b> and Oak Eggar Moth were examined in the electron microscope after negative staining. Except for the ladybird all the defensive fluids, haemolymphs and egg fluids contained particles 100 - 150 A across which frequently had rectangular or square outlines. In some species the particles were occasionally arranged in groups of 2 and 4 and in the egg fluid of the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger</b> they were arranged in rows which were aligned side by side to form strands of considerable length. The particles {{are believed to be}} protein. They correspond in size to the 16 s component of the haemocyanin 8 of Limulus and Homarus and the protein particles found in Calliphora by other workers...|$|R
5000|$|Some insects, notably some Noctuid moths (such as the Large Yellow Underwing) {{and some}} <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> (such as the <b>Garden</b> <b>Tiger),</b> were {{originally}} theorized {{to defend themselves}} against predation by echolocating bats, both by passively absorbing sound with soft, fur-like body coverings and by actively creating sounds to mimic echoes from other locations or objects (a [...] "phantom echo" [...] that might therefore represent [...] "auditory crypsis"), with alternative theories about interfering with the bats' echolocation ("jamming"). Subsequent research has provided evidence for only two functions of moth sounds, neither of which involve [...] "auditory crypsis:" [...] <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> species appear to cluster into two distinct groups: one type produces sounds as acoustic aposematism (warning the bats that the moths are unpalatable) or are acoustic mimics of unpalatable moths, and another type that uses sonar jamming. In the latter type of moth, detailed analyses failed to support a [...] "phantom echo" [...] mechanism underlying sonar jamming but instead pointed towards echo interference.|$|R
25|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> {{population}} {{decline is}} of concern for both laboratory research and in nature. A possible way to combat this in a laboratory setting is to use synthetic food. While not ideal, it resolves many issues that arise when trying to raise captive Lepidoptera. Concerns such as food sterility are quickly resolved, along with issues of gathering hard to find or cultivate host plant material. Many larvae, including those of A. caja, can consume synthetic food, which is based primarily on agar, powdered cellulose, cabbage, sucrose, salts, and wheat germ. Synthetic options {{appear to be a}} promising way to raise lab populations of this species, for conservation or for study.|$|E

50|$|After 1936, {{the gradual}} rate of {{acceleration}} of <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> manufacturing {{had reached the}} point where production capacity became finally able to exceed the demands from military customers alone. By the outbreak of the Second World War, a total of 1,424 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths</b> had been completed by both domestic and overseas manufacturing efforts. In 1941, de Havilland transferred principal manufacturing activity for the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> from its Hatfield factory to Morris Motors Limited at their facility in Cowley, Oxford. In 1945, all activity on the British <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> production lines was terminated; by this point, Morris Motors had completed a total of 3,433 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moths.</b>|$|R

Several <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> were used in the crash scenes in The Great Waldo Pepper, standing in for the Curtiss JN-1. Due to the popularity of the design and the rising cost of flyable examples, a number of replicas (scale and full-size) have been designed for the homebuilder, including the Fisher R-80 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth</b> and the RagWing RW22 <b>Tiger</b> <b>Moth.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} much of the Palearctic, in Europe as far north as Lapland, in Northern Asia and Central Asia, and in North America. In the mountains (Tien Shan) this species is found up to an elevation of 3000 m. The <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> loves damp places, which is why it is particularly common in river valleys as well as gardens and parks. The moth is nocturnal and can usually only be seen flying around a source of light. The distinctively coloured, long-haired caterpillar, on the other hand, is seen more frequently. It can grow up to 6 cm long and plays dead when in danger. These moths are most common in June to August, in gardens, park, meadows, grasslands, and scrubby areas.|$|E

5000|$|Rabbits are {{currently}} the only grazing animal {{and in the}} 1960s myxomatosis decimated the population and led to an increase of scrub on parts of the island, especially [...] "the neck" [...] where in some years cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) were attracted by {{the large numbers of}} <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> (Arctia caja) and other large caterpillars. In one year the number of garden tiger larvae was 90 per square metre. The last grazing animals left in 1974 and Natural England would like grazing animals back on Gugh to counteract the effects of the scrub and dense sward of grass covering parts of the island. A cobalt deficiency in the soil means grazing animals need supplements.|$|E
50|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning.

40|$|By {{means of}} the new {{technique}} of cutting ultmthin sections for electron microscopy {{it is now possible}} to section the virus particles themselves and this allows, within limits, the examination of their fine structure. The viruses affecting insects are particularly suitable for a study of this kind, because of their apparently complex nature, their comparatively large size, and their peculiar relationship with the host cell. The viruses which have been selected for this study are representative of each of the known insect virus types; these are, cytoplasmic polyhedral viruses which affect the gut cells of the larvae of Arctia caja, the <b>garden</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>moth,</b> and other species; a nuclear polyhedral virus which multiplies in the blood cells of a fly larva, Tipula paludosa; a recently discovered virus which multiplies in the fat body of the same larva without the formation of polyliedra, and a granulosis or capsular disease virus from the larva of Melanchra persicariae L., the dot moth. Materials and Metkods For sectioning, all material was fixed in 2 per cent osmic acid, buffered at pH 7 with phosphate buffer, dehydrated with alcohol, and embedded in a mixture of 8 parts butyl methaerylate and 2 parts methyl methacrylate. To obtain sections of the virus particles themselves, freed from cellular material, these were spun down in osmic acid at a speed of 12, 000 r~. P. xt. for 40 minutes and the pellet treated similarly to the other material. The sections were not shadowed with metal, since the methacrylate was not removed, and they were cut on a Cook and Perkins microtome, fitted with a glass knife. Figs. 6, 12, and 15 illustrate sections through pellets of virus. The unseetioned virus particles were shadowed with gold-palladium. Some of the photographs were taken on a Siemens Elmiskop I microscope at 80 kv. and the others on a Metropolitan-Vickers EM 3 electron microscope at 75 kv. Those sections which were thin enough were photographed at a magnification of 40, 000 times on the Siemens microscope and later enlarged optically. Both carbon and formvar-supporting films were used on the grids...|$|E

50|$|Many <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> produce {{ultrasonic}} clicks {{in response}} to the echolocation calls bats use while attacking prey. For most species of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> these clicks warn bats that the moths have toxic compounds that make them distasteful. However, the <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> Bertholdia trigona produces clicks at a very high rate (up to 4,500 per second) to jam bat echolocation. Jamming is the most effective defense against bats ever documented, with jamming causing a ten-fold decrease in bat capture success in the field.|$|R
40|$|Lepidopterism is {{a disease}} caused by the urticating scales and toxic fluids of adult moths, {{butterflies}} or its caterpillars. The resulting cutaneous eruptions and systemic problems progress to clinical complications sometimes leading to death. High incidence of fever epidemics were associated with massive outbreaks of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> Asota caricae adult populations during monsoon in Kerala, India. A significant number of monsoon related fever characteristic to lepidopterism was erroneously treated as infectious fevers due to lookalike symptoms. To diagnose <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> lepidopterism, we conducted immunoblots for <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> specific IgE in fever patients' sera. We selected a cohort of patients (n = 155) with hallmark symptoms of infectious fevers but were tested negative to infectious fevers. In these cases, the total IgE was elevated and was detected positive (78. 6 %) for <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> specific IgE allergens. Chemical characterization of caterpillar and adult moth fluids was performed by HPLC and GC-MS analysis and structural identification of moth scales was performed by SEM analysis. The body fluids and chitinous scales {{were found to be}} highly toxic and inflammatory in nature. To replicate the disease in experimental model, wistar rats were exposed to live <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> in a dose dependant manner and observed similar clinico-pathological complications reported during the fever epidemics. Further, to link larval abundance and fever epidemics we conducted cointegration test for the period 2009 to 2012 and physical presence of the <b>tiger</b> <b>moths</b> were found to be cointegrated with fever epidemics. In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that inhalation of aerosols containing <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> fluids, scales and hairs cause systemic reactions that can be fatal to human. All these evidences points to the possible involvement of <b>tiger</b> <b>moth</b> disease as a major cause to the massive and fatal fever epidemics observed in Kerala...|$|R
