In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E

However, some experiments might require a fully functioning and suffering animal emulation. Animals might also suffer by accident due to flaws and lack of insight into what parts of their brains are suffering. Questions also arise regarding the moral status of partial brain emulations, as well as creating neuromorphic emulations that draw inspiration from biological brains but are built somewhat differently.|$|E

25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name.|$|E
25|$|The port of Narvik {{proved to}} be {{strategically}} valuable {{in the early years}} of World War II and the town became a focal point of the Norwegian Campaign. In 1939, Germany's war industry depended upon iron ore mined in Kiruna and Malmberget in Sweden. During the summer season, this ore could be sent by cargo ship to Germany through the Baltic Sea via the Swedish port of Luleå on the Gulf of Bothnia. However, when the Gulf of Bothnia froze during the winter, more shipments of the ore needed to be transported through Narvik and, from there, down the west coast of Norway to Germany. The town of Narvik is linked by rail to Sweden, but not to any other towns in Norway. As a result, Narvik serves as a gateway to the ore fields of Sweden that cannot be easily reached from southern Norway via land. Winston Churchill realized that the control of Narvik meant stopping most German imports of iron ore during the winter of 1940. This would be advantageous to the Allies, and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> shorten the war. Equally as important, later in the war, German submarines and warships based there threatened the allied supply line to the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|No {{historian}} contests that Philip's successor Decius (r. 249–51), {{called a}} general persecution against the Church, and most would list {{it as the}} first. Decius was anxious to secure himself in the imperial office. Before mid-December 249, Decius issued an edict demanding that all Romans, throughout the empire, make a show of sacrifice to the gods. Libelli were signed in Fayum in June and July 250 as demonstrations of this sacrifice. If the persecutions of Maximin and Septimius Severus are dismissed as fiction, Decius' edict was without precedent. [...] If the Christians {{were believed to be}} Philip's friends (as Dionysius of Alexandria presents them), however, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> explain Decius' motivations.|$|E

500|$|Drawing on Adam of Bremen's {{assertion}} that Orkney was not conquered {{until the time}} of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043–66, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd {{may have been the}} first Earl of Orkney. He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth, circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier. He concludes that [...] "If there were no earls in Orkney before Sigurð's time <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> to explain the islands' low profile in the annals since these, for the most part, record only the deaths of great men." [...] However, the absence of comment on this subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd's death there is hardly surprising. Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and [...] "not much concerned" [...] with Orkney. Smyth (1984) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf-Einarr [...] "may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{being one}} of Hargrove's 40 {{endorsed}} NDP candidates, Sid Ryan, president of the Ontario chapter of the Canadian Union of Public Employees and the candidate for Oshawa, blamed his loss on tactical voting. [...] Ryan claimed Hargrove's statement confused potential NDP supporters in his riding and caused {{some of them to}} vote Liberal even though the Liberal candidate was not a viable contender. A poll in Oshawa found that the proportion of voters sampled who initially planned to vote for Ryan before switching their support to the third-place Liberal candidate late in the campaign (thinking <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> prevent a national Conservative victory) significantly exceeded the narrow margin of Ryan's loss - if the poll is accurate then the tactic did indeed result in Tory Colin Carrie's election.|$|E
2500|$|When {{methylene}} blue is [...] "polychromed" [...] (oxidized in solution or [...] "ripened" [...] by fungal metabolism, as originally {{noted in the}} thesis of Dr. D. L. Romanowsky in 1890s), it gets serially demethylated and forms all the tri-, di-, mono- and non-methyl intermediates, which are Azure B, Azure A, Azure C, and thionine, respectively. This {{is the basis of}} the basophilic part of the spectrum of Romanowski-Giemsa effect. If only synthetic Azure B and Eosin Y is used, it may serve as a standardized Giemsa stain; but, without {{methylene blue}}, the normal neutrophilic granules tend to overstain and look like toxic granules. On the other hand, if methylene blue is used <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> to give the normal look of neutrophil granules and may also enhance the staining of nucleoli and polychromatophilic RBCs (reticulocytes).|$|E

2500|$|Drake {{became the}} {{ambassador}} of the Cimarrones, Spain's leading New World enemies. The Spanish feared the Cimarron {{alliance with the}} English, believing it might lead to larger scale expeditions and possibly even settlement. They also believed that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> the English reach the Pacific and steal their treasure. In 1577, the English {{took advantage of the}} alliance to launch multiple successful raids in the Pacific. The English also angered the Spanish by instilling in the Cimarrons a hatred for Catholicism and a love for Lutheranism. Citizens of Panama wrote anxious letters to Madrid complaining about how the cimarrons were inflicting heavy damage in robbery, plunder and death. One such letter stated, [...] "this league between the English and the Negroes is very detrimental to this kingdom, because, being so thoroughly acquainted with the region and so expert in the bush, the Negroes will show them methods and means to accomplish any evil design they may wish to carry out".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are differing {{recommendations}} {{about the}} importance of interviews, with the consensus view that interviews were overall less important than college admissions essays, but should be done if they were offered. One advisor suggested that visits by college admissions personnel to the high schools were a waste of time for colleges, since there was not enough time to get to know specific applicants. In addition, she felt that personal interviews were generally overrated, though she noted that many Ivies have alumni interviews, which can help in borderline situations. One counselor suggested that if an interview was offered by a college admissions program, then it was not really optional but it should be seen as a requirement, that is, not going to such an interview could be detrimental to a student's chances for admission. Another suggested that a student should try to get an interview, even if it was not required, since <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>help</b> [...] "exhibit character strengths" [...] that might not show up via grades on high school transcripts. Several reports noted that most Ivy League schools have abandoned the interview requirement, but that if there is an opportunity for an interview, even with an alumnus of the college, then {{it is a good idea}} to do it since not doing it signals a lack of interest in the school. Knowing a college can be helpful during an interview, so that an applicant can say something specific about the school, or a professor who teaches there, or a subject or internship opportunities, since it shows sincere interest. Interviews (if offered) may be more of a factor at small liberal arts colleges: ...|$|E

5000|$|In the United States {{the conference}} between Hoover and Laval was an {{exercise}} in mutual frustration. Hoover's plan for a reduced military had been rebuffed - albeit gently.
