40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift to using more {{lightweight}} materials for the potential of fuel consumption reduction. In the Aerospace Industry, conventional metal structures are being replaced by advanced composite structures. The major advantage of an advanced composite structure is the huge {{reduction in the number of}} parts and joints required. Also composite materials provide better resistance to creep, corrosion, and fatigue. However, one cannot eliminate all the joints and attachments in an aircraft’s structure. Eliminating structural joints is impractical in present-day aircraft because of the requirements for inspection, manufacturing breaks, assembly and equipment access, and replacement of damaged structures. Currently, composite joints are overdesigned which leads to weight penalties. Understanding how to optimize the ultimate bearing strength of a composite joint by altering the cure cycle might be beneficial to the composite joint design process. This study investigates, through numerical and experimental analysis, the mechanical behavior of double shear joints. The first task is to test Aluminum double shear joint specimens inside the double shear <b>joint</b> <b>fixture</b> at a loading rate of 0. 05 in. /min. (quasi-static). The second task is to numerically model and validate the aluminum double shear joint specimen. The third task is to test the Unidirectional MTM 49 carbon fiber pre-preg double shear composite joint specimens with two different cure cycles and five different loading rates (0. 05 in. /min., 0. 1 in. /min., 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.). The double shear composite joint specimens are made, using a heat press, with a quasi-isotropic laminate orientation of [0 0 + 45 - 45 + 45 - 45 90 90]s. The first cure cycle used is called the alternate cure cycle, which is Cytec’s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle, and the second cure cycle used is called the datasheet cure cycle, which is Umeco 2 ̆ 7 s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle. The recommended datasheet cure cycle and an alternate cure cycle are both compared to see how they affect the mechanical characteristics of the matrix along with the bearing stress. The fourth task is to adjust the Aluminum double shear joint numerical model for the double shear composite joint specimen. The numerical results for both the Aluminum and the composite specimens are in agreement with the experimental results. The theoretical in-plane material properties of the quasi-isotropic laminate were in agreement with the experimental results. One can see that at 0. 05 in. /min. and 0. 1 in. /min. (for both cure cycles) the composite double shear specimens carried more load compared to the higher loading rates of 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min. The tensile modulus of elasticity of an Aluminum sample is measured using a crosshead displacement, a strain gage and an extensometer. The crosshead displacement yielded very inaccurate results when compared to the strain gage and the extensometer...|$|E

30|$|Another {{challenge}} in teaching students to identify abstract concepts from observable scientific data is that, by definition, abstract concepts are not consistently associated with invariable observable physical features across different contexts. Therefore, {{we must continue}} investigating the influence of context on abstract conceptual representation. One way of doing this is by directly comparing neural activity across ambiguous descriptions of object concepts when different contexts are provided. For instance, evoking a context by giving instructions to point out objects fitting a given description—e.g., a functional unit positioned {{at the end of}} a support arm—might result in similar neural patterns when identifying functionally dissimilar objects—e.g., a hammer and a street light. Such comparisons made across categories, including functional, visual, and haptic similarity, could inform the current debate between amodal and sensorimotor theorists. Thus, if a hammer and a light pole are represented similarly in the cortex while individuals focus on the visual features of the objects, but differently while they focus on functional characteristics, it would be clear that contextual cues influence conceptual knowledge. Accordingly, we would expect to see distinct activation patterns when these principles are applied to abstract versus concrete concepts (Borghi & Cimatti, 2009; Granito et al., 2015). Asking a participant to determine the likely air temperature, for instance, would lead an observer to direct their gaze towards a scene as a whole searching for key indicators, which could be measured via eye tracking; conversely, evaluating the structural integrity of an engineering apparatus (e.g., a truss) might lead one to focus his or her gaze on specific features within the object itself (e.g., <b>joint</b> <b>fixtures).</b> Further, it is possible to infer which objects in a scene are important for understanding a given concept and at what point attention is directed towards a given object or the scene as a whole, for example, using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), in addition to eye tracking and correlated with measures of behavioral performance across subjects. This type of analysis can also examine the potential facilitating effect of top-down instructions (e.g., search cues) provided at various points in the instruction process. Research on multimedia instruction has identified several best practices for reducing cognitive load as well as pitfalls to avoid that lead to cognitive overload (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). The addition of neural markers of attention and of conceptual comprehension will aid in further determining when a student is attending the appropriate details of the lesson. This information can then be used to modify instruction accordingly, adjusting factors such as when and how to introduce new facts and visual details in a multimedia lesson. In this way, we will have an opportunity to design new methods of teaching STEM concepts, taking advantage of our understanding of the neural basis of conceptual understanding.|$|R
40|$|Any and all {{chemicals}} generated by human activity {{can and will}} {{find their way into}} water supplies. The types and quantities of carcinogens present in drinking water at the point of consumption will differ depending on whether they result from contamination of the source water, arise as a consequence of treatment processes, or enter as the water is conveyed to the user. Source-water contaminants of concern include arsenic, asbestos, radon, agricultural chemicals, and hazardous waste. Of these, the strongest evidence for a cancer risk involves arsenic, which is linked to cancers of the liver, lung, bladder, and kidney. The use of chlorine for water treatment {{to reduce the risk of}} infectious disease may account for a substantial portion of the cancer risk associated with drinking water. The by-products of chlorination are associated with increased risk of bladder and rectal cancer, possibly accounting for 5000 cases of bladder cancer and 8000 cases of rectal cancer per year in the United States. Fluoridation of water has received great scrutiny but appears to pose little or no cancer risk. Further research is needed to identify and quantify risks posed by contaminants from drinking-water distribution pipes, linings, <b>joints,</b> and <b>fixtures</b> and by biologically active micropollutants, such as microbial agents. We need more cost-effective methods for monitoring drinking-water quality and further research on interventions to minimize cancer risks fro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates a {{calibration}} method where the manipulator end-effector is constrained {{to a single}} contact point using a fixture equivalent to a spherical <b>joint.</b> The required <b>fixture</b> {{has the advantage of}} being inexpensive and compact when compared to pose measuring devices required by other calibration techniques, such as theodolites. By forming the manipulator into a mobile closed kinematic chain, the kinematic loop closure equations are adequate to calibrate the manipulator as it executes self-motions, without the need of endpoint measurements or precision points. Adding a wrist force sensor allows for the calibration of elastic effects due to end-point forces and moments. A performance index is introduced to calculate the optimal location of the calibration device. The method is evaluated experimentally on a Schilling Titan II manipulator. The results show that the {{calibration method}} is able to effectively identify and correct for the errors in the system...|$|R
40|$|Recently, mankind has {{realized}} {{that unless the}} environment is protected, he himself will be threatened by the over consumption of natural resources as well as substantial reduction of fresh air produced in the world. Conservation of forests and optimal utilization of agricultural and other renewable resources like solar and wind energies, and recently, tidal energy have become important topics worldwide. In such concern, the use of renewable resources such as plant and animal based fibre-reinforce polymeric composites, has been becoming an important design criterion for designing and manufacturing components for all industrial products. Research on biodegradable polymeric composites, can contribute to a green and safe environment to some extent. In the biomedical and bioengineered field, the use of natural fibre mixed with biodegradable and bioresorbable polymers can produce <b>joints</b> and bone <b>fixtures</b> to alleviate pain for patients.

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new joining process that has exhibited many advantages over traditional arc welding processes, including greatly reducing distortion and eliminating solidification. The present work aims to determine the feasibility to weld two pieces of aluminum pipe by friction stir welding process and study the effect on the mechanical properties of welding <b>joints.</b> Special welding <b>fixture</b> fixed on conventional milling machine has been conducted to attempt this welding and group of welding parameters. Three tool rotational speeds (500, 630, 800 rpm) with four welding speeds (0. 5, 1, 2, 3 mm/sec) for each rotational speed had been used to study the effect of each parameters (tool rotation, weld speed) on mechanical and microstructure properties of welded joints. Mechanical properties of welded joints were investigated using different mechanical tests including non destructive test (visual inspection, X-ray) and destructive test (tensile test, microhardeness and microstructure). Based on the stir welding experiments conducted in this study the results show that aluminum pipe (AA 6061 -T 6) can be welded by (FSW) process with a maximum welding efficiency (61. 7 %) in terms of ultimate tensile strength, using 630 (RPM) rotational speed, 1 (mm/sec) traveling speed...|$|R
