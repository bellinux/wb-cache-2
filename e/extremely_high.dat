5|$|Some ships {{had sought}} shelter {{along the coast}} in Michigan or along the Goderich to Point Edward coast but few survived the {{powerful}} north winds. Three of the larger ships were found upside down, indicative of <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> winds and tall waves.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricately}} constructed saliva nests of this swiftlet genus, {{which in}} some species contain no other material, are collected to make the delicacy bird's nest soup. They therefore command <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> prices.|$|E
30|$|In the {{original}} image (Figure 7 a), {{it is clear}} that mountainous and urban areas present obviously different features; in Figure 7 b, this difference is also clearly presented. For examples, in the 18 th semantic feature, the cyan column is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than the red, while in the 88 th semantic feature, the red column is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than the cyan. This indicates that semantic features {{can be used as a}} replacement for low-level features to distinguish between different ground covers.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{characteristics}} of the sea area in these two images are same, the concept is different because the area adjacent to sea in Figure 8 a is urban while in Figure 8 b it is mountain. This different concept between two sea areas is clearly presented in Figure 8 c. For examples, in the 26 th semantic feature, the red column is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than the cyan while in the 86 th semantic feature, the cyan column is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than the red. This indicates that these semantic features can also well describe the high-level semantic concepts hidden in images.|$|R
30|$|The {{result of}} {{study showed that}} the overall mean {{concentrations}} of the heavy metals viz. chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and cobalt (CO) were 290.1, 782.1, 443.6, 133.1 and 331.0  ppm respectively which is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than US EPA and EU regulation standards.|$|R
5|$|The summit {{station of}} Mount Washington has an alpine climate or tundra climate (Köppen ET), {{although}} it receives an <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> amount of precipitation, atypical for most regions with such cold weather. Lower elevations have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc).|$|E
5|$|About 73 {{percent of}} Japan is forested, mountainous and {{unsuitable}} for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> population densities. Japan {{is one of}} the most densely populated countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|Although the North Indian Ocean is a {{relatively}} inactive basin, <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> population densities in the Ganges and Ayeyarwady Deltas mean that the deadliest tropical cyclones {{in the world have}} formed here, including the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed 500,000 people. Nations affected include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan.|$|E
30|$|Although these {{different}} incidents have different causes, the effects were similar and some common {{conclusions can be}} drawn. The presence of algorithmic trading and HFT {{in the financial markets}} exacerbates the adverse impacts of trading-related mistakes. It may lead to <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> market volatility and surprises about suddenly-diminished liquidity. This raises concerns about the stability and health of the financial markets for regulators.|$|R
40|$|Metastable {{deexcitation}} spectroscopy (MDS) {{was applied}} {{to the study of the}} electronic structure of Sb/GaAs(110) and H:GaAs(110) systems. For both systems valuable insights into the surface electronic structure (effective surface density of states and surface charge density) were obtained. A surface to volume ratio <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than photoemission was obtained for MDS. For both systems new features, never observed by more conventional surface spectroscopies, were detected...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} firm-level {{relationship}} between the local input share {{and the number of}} used FTAs by employing the data on FTA utilization in Japanese affiliates in ASEAN. As a result, we do not find a robust linear relationship. However, affiliates using a large number of FTAs (seven or eight) have an <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> share of local inputs. This result might be interpreted as the first evidence of the “spaghetti bowl phenomenon”...|$|R
5|$|By {{contrast}} the Russian forces' morale was <b>extremely</b> <b>high.</b> The Russian commanders had ample experience in siege operations; Paskevich himself had captured {{at least six}} fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas-Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of cowpea are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated. There {{is a high}} level of morphological diversity found within the species with large variations in the size, shape and structure of the plant. Cowpeas can be erect, semi erect (trailing) or climbing. The crop is mainly grown for its seeds, which are <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> in protein, although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed.|$|E

40|$|Distribution and {{activity}} of alkaline phosphatase in dental pulp and root, and gingiva, were measured histochemically by Gomori's method during inflammation and dental rootcyst. During inflammation of pulp and gingiva, {{the activity of}} alkaline phosphatase increased considerably, especially in {{the walls of the}} inflammatory blood vessels, leucocytes, and growing tissues. In vacuole-degenerated and necrobiotic tissues, however, there was less phosphatase activity. The outer layer of dental root-cyst had an <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> phosphatase activity when compared to other tissues...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} electron cooling {{based on}} a clean normal-metal/spin-filter/superconductor junction. Due to {{the suppression of the}} Andreev reflection by the spin-filter effect, the cooling power of the system is found to be <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than that for conventional normal-metal/nonmagnetic-insulator/superconductor coolers. Therefore we can extract large amount of heat from normal metals. Our results strongly indicate the practical usefulness of the spin-filter effect for cooling detectors, sensors, and quantum bits.

5|$|Gamma ray telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources. These are {{absorbed by the}} atmosphere, {{requiring}} that observations are done by high-altitude balloons or space missions. Gamma rays can be generated by supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. Gamma ray bursts, with <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> energies, have also been detected but {{have yet to be}} identified.|$|E
5|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the most}} distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet {{to work on a}} given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. Many distributed computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E
5|$|In {{countries}} where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw materials {{can be purchased}} from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques. The resulting product can be marketed at <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> markup, so end-user prices can {{be as high as}} 300 times the bulk cost of raw ingredients.|$|E
40|$|In China, {{the higher}} the fees, the {{stronger}} the college-going aspiration of senior high school students. This study demonstrated that this paradox didn't result {{from the fact that}} the rate of economic growth and family income increase are higher thanthat of fee rise or student's disability in perception of real fees, but {{from the fact that the}} expected return to <b>higher</b> edutcation is <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than perceived fees. The perceived fees, however, gave a substantial amount of effect on senior high school students'college choices...|$|R
30|$|Cyanide {{levels in}} most of the water samples {{analysed}} were found to be <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than the WHO guideline of 0.2  mg/L except those from sampling sites along the Kwabrafo River where the level was below detection. This calls for a lot of concern because of the health effect of cyanide ingestion and the fact that cyanide can be found in water primarily as a consequence of industrial contamination. Accidental spills of cyanide solutions into rivers and streams have produced massive kills of fish and other aquatic biota (Adimado and Amegbey 2003).|$|R
30|$|Results: DIC {{patients}} showed {{significantly lower}} platelet counts, fibrinogen and antithrombin levels, and more prolonged prothrombin time {{throughout the study}} period. FDP and D-dimer levels as well as FDP/D-dimer ratio of DIC patients were <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than those without DIC. Mean values of FDP/D-dimer ratio of DIC patients exceed 2.0, which suggests fibrin(ogen)olysis. Higher sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) (9 vs. 6, p[*]<[*] 0.001) associated with increased prevalence of multiple organ dysfunction (23.6  % vs. 3.9  %, p[*]<[*] 0.001) in DIC patients were observed, which leads to higher hospital mortality of DIC patients (54.8  % vs. 23.9  %, p[*]<[*] 0.001).|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E
5|$|September 4, 1917 – Enormous {{waves and}} <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> tides {{from a major}} {{hurricane}} to the east inundate low-lying areas, including the entirety of Market Square in St. George's; individuals at Town Hall become stranded by the rising waters. A large section of Higgs' Island is swept away.|$|E
5|$|The Mundo Perdido {{continued}} {{to serve as}} an important burial site during the 8th and 9th centuries. The final version of the Talud-Tablero Temple received three elite status burials, possibly {{members of the royal family}} to judge by the <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> quality of the associated offerings. These burials have been dated to the second half of the 8th century, during the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a novel method to {{generate}} higher order modes in the frequency range of millimeter and submillimeter wave regime. The method uses magnetic coupling scheme between waveguide fundamental mode and a cavity mode. A TE 62 mode at W-band was considered for design using the proposed scheme. The suggested method simplifies a mode generator design allowing direct feeding via a standard fundamental waveguide and also provides a compact mode generator to design <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> order mode in a cavity. In addition, it opens a new and novel way to develop high power high gain gyrotron amplifiers at millimeter and submillimeter wave regime. close 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of road segment {{alignment}} and location on rural two-lane highway crash rates by taking the mileage of segment types into consideration. Roadway segments are classified and redefined according to the segment alignment and location. The definitions of crash rates in terms of segment alignment and location are presented respectively. The study gathers crash data and the roadway geometric information of rural two-lane highways in southwest of China and crash rates of each segment type are proposed by utilizing the proposed definitions. The result indicates that gentle-slope & sharp-curve segments and intersections tend to have <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> crash rates than the other types of segments...|$|R
40|$|The vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 (VKORC 1) {{has been}} {{identified}} recently. It is {{a component of the}} enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase that is the therapeutic target site of warfarin. In order to investigate the relationship between VKORC 1 gene and warfarin dose response, we studied this gene in an Iranian warfarin resistant patient who receive more than 100 mg warfarin per day. The results showed that although warfarin concentration in his plasma was <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> than therapeutic level (22. 8 mg L - 1) but no mutation(s) found in the exons of VKORC 1 gene. Other genes may be contributed in resistance to warfarin in this patient...|$|R
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> {{standard}} of naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills {{would be made}} into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a {{scientist}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, intercepts a visual transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by a volcanic research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon. Firewalker is broadcasting from inside a volcanic cave, where Pierce glimpses the dead body of the chief seismologist, Phil Erickson. He also sees a shadow moving in the cave, an impossibility due to the <b>extremely</b> <b>high</b> temperatures. Firewalker's camera is then destroyed, ending the transmission.|$|E

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} characteristics {{vary depending}} on the operation type of the landfill and the age of the landfill. At landfills operated as bioreactors, where leachate recirculation is practiced, leachate ammonia nitrogen concentrations may accumulate to <b>extremely</b> <b>higher</b> levels than during single pass leaching, thereby requiring treatment before final discharge to a receiving system (Onay, 1998). Usually several physical/chemical wastewater treatment technologies are used to treat the leachate. In most cases the COD and BOD are treated, and then nitrification is performed in a separate sophisticated ex situ system. The additional costs of these systems can be very high. The use of a readily available media for in situ nitrification should be considered a prime objective to avoid extra costs...|$|R
