2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E

5000|$|A can wrench is {{a wrench}} made {{to open a}} {{telephone}} distribution terminal also called a telco can or demarcation point box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> for use on binding posts. The wrench is {{also referred to as}} a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock. The <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> on each end is a thin wall thickness to allow the outside diameter to be placed into the tight recessed access often found on telco cans and demarc boxes.|$|E
5000|$|A spider is a simple, {{relatively}} inexpensive, limited-capability {{version of}} an independent-jaw chuck. It typically consists of a ring of metal with screw threads tapped radially into it, in which screws (<b>hex</b> cap, <b>socket</b> <b>hex</b> cap, or set screws) serve as independent jaws. Spiders can serve various purposes: ...|$|R
50|$|Common bolt heads include hex, slotted <b>hex</b> washer, and <b>socket</b> cap.|$|R
50|$|A {{counterbore}} hole is usually used when {{the head of}} a fastener, such as a <b>hex</b> head or <b>socket</b> head capscrew, is required to be flush with or below the level of a workpieces surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. <b>Hex</b> <b>socket</b> cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the <b>hex</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hex</b> <b>socket</b> screw {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|E
5000|$|Soon after SPS {{had begun}} {{producing}} the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head set screw, Hallowell {{had the idea}} to make a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head cap screw (SHCS). Hallowell said, [...] "Up to this moment {{none of us had}} ever seen a socket head cap screw, and what I am about to relate concerns what I believe was the first socket head cap screw ever made in this country U.S.." [...] SPS gave their line of screws the Unbrako brand name, chosen for its echoing of the word [...]|$|E
50|$|Square {{heads and}} sockets were {{the easiest to}} make in the era when hand filing was the typical method of manufacture. With the {{proliferation}} of modern manufacturing methods, such as milling, shaping, broaching, and advanced die forging, it became just as easy to make <b>hex</b> heads and <b>sockets</b> as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet pawl to catch the next tooth.|$|R
50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, it {{was founded in}} 1895 subsequent to the J.T. Case Engine Company, a manufacturer of steam engines. The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw mortising machine. In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of <b>hex</b> drive <b>sockets</b> and an ell bar for the drive tool. Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 square drive tools with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|R
50|$|The Allen socket may be 6 {{point or}} 12 point (also {{known as a}} double <b>hex</b> <b>socket).</b> They are used where hex or square nuts won't fit.|$|E
50|$|Some devices contain {{non-standard}} screws or bolts in {{an attempt}} to deter access. Examples are telephone switching cabinets (which have triangular bolt heads that a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> fits) and computer hard drives, which usually have a star-shaped head for the screws, known as Torx heads. Drivers for these heads are commonly available from electronics retailers.|$|E
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|E
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head set screws, and Hallowell patented a shaft collar with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar {{was soon copied}} by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909-1910, William G. Allen {{patented}} {{a method}} of cold-forming screw heads around a hexagonal die (...) [...] Published advertisements for the [...] "Allen safety set screw" [...] by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, exist from 1910. Although {{it is unlikely that}} Allen {{was the first person to}} think of a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive, his patent for a manufacturing method and his realized product appear to be the first.|$|E
50|$|The Torx design {{allows for}} a higher torque to be exerted than a {{similarly}} sized conventional <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> head without damaging the head and/or the tool. The diagram on the right depicts {{the interaction between the}} male and female components of a conventional hex drive and a Torx drive. The clearance between the components is exaggerated for clarity. The diagram does not show a true Torx profile, but illustrates the general shape and geometry.|$|E
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> screw drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|E
5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> drive.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (<b>hex</b> <b>socket)</b> shortly followed in 1911.|$|E
50|$|A {{set screw}} {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used to secure an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a set screw has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind set screw (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a <b>hex</b> <b>socket</b> (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The set screw passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E
