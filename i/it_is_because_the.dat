Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished {{to move beyond the}} conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

Miller in his book began the [...] "queer" [...] reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men.

500|$|In 1869, John William Fenton, {{a visiting}} Irish {{military}} band leader, {{realized there was}} no national anthem in Japan, and suggested to Iwao Ōyama, {{an officer of the}} Satsuma Clan, that one be created. Ōyama agreed, and selected the lyrics. The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem, due to Fenton's influence. After selecting the anthem's lyrics, Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody and only a few days to rehearse, Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870. This was the first version of [...] "Kimigayo". This was discarded because the melody [...] "lacked solemnity", according to the Japanese government although others believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> melody was actually [...] "unsingable" [...] for the Japanese.

500|$|According to Satoru Iwata, former President of Nintendo, Dragon Quests {{widespread}} {{appeal is}} that it is [...] "made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests."

Ryutaro Ichimura, producer at Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the Dragon Quest storylines allow players to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero saving the world. Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of casual gamers, while not alienating the more hardcore gamers, is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals; casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but for those who want more there is still content for them to pursue.|$|E

500|$|Once, profuse runs of {{anadromous}} fish—salmon, steelhead, and others—migrated up the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers {{to spawn}} in great numbers. The construction of CVP dams {{on the two}} rivers {{and many of their}} major tributaries—namely Friant Dam and Shasta Dam—mostly ended the once-bountiful Central Valley salmon run. From north to south, the Sacramento upriver of Shasta Dam, the American upriver of Folsom Dam, the Stanislaus upriver of New Melones Dam, and the San Joaquin upriver of Mendota—have become inaccessible to migrating salmon. In three of these cases, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> dams are too high and their reservoirs too large for fish to bypass via fish ladders.

Even downstream of Mendota, where the Delta-Mendota Canal gives the river a new surge of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, irrigation runoff water, contaminated with pesticides and fertilizer, has caused the river to become heavily polluted. To make matters worse, efforts by the California Department of Fish and Game to route the San Joaquin salmon run into the Merced River in the 1950s failed, because the salmon did not recognize the Merced as their [...] "home stream".|$|E

2500|$|Evolutionary {{anthropologist}} Sarah Hrdy {{observes that}} only human mothers among great apes {{are willing to}} let another individual take hold of their own babies; further, we are routinely willing to let others babysit. She identifies lack of trust as the major factor preventing chimp, bonobo or gorilla mothers from doing the same: [...] "If ape mothers insist on carrying their babies everywhere... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> available alternatives are not safe enough." [...] The fundamental problem is that ape mothers (unlike monkey mothers who may often babysit) do not have female relatives nearby. The strong implication is that, {{in the course of}} Homo evolution, allocare could develop because Homo mothers did have female kin close by— in the first place, most reliably, their own mothers. Extending the Grandmother hypothesis, Hrdy argues that evolving Homo erectus females necessarily relied on female kin initially; this novel situation in ape evolution of mother, infant and mother's mother as allocarer provided the evolutionary ground for the emergence of intersubjectivity. She relates this onset of [...] "cooperative breeding in an ape" [...] to shifts in life history and slower child development, linked to the change in brain and body size from the 2 million year mark.|$|E
