5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more <b>helium,</b> the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} <b>helium</b> core becomes degenerate prior to <b>helium</b> fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, <b>helium</b> fusion begins explosively in what is called a <b>helium</b> flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, <b>helium</b> core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning <b>helium,</b> before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to the horizontal branch.|$|E
5|$|Death {{caused by}} <b>helium</b> is rare. The first media-recorded case {{was that of}} a 15-year-old girl from Texas who died in 1998 from <b>helium</b> {{inhalation}} at a friend's party; the exact type of <b>helium</b> death is unidentified.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, <b>helium</b> {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% <b>helium.</b> Since <b>helium</b> has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude <b>helium</b> gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A <b>helium.</b> The principal impurity in Grade-A <b>helium</b> is neon. In a final production step, most of the <b>helium</b> that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid <b>helium</b> and also allows <b>helium</b> suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid <b>helium</b> containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous <b>helium</b> tube trailers.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, <b>helium</b> {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain up to 7% <b>helium.</b>|$|E
5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable <b>helium</b> in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of <b>helium</b> within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of <b>helium.</b> Through this time, both <b>helium</b> consumption {{and the costs of}} producing <b>helium</b> increased. From 2002 to 2007 <b>helium</b> prices doubled.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe. Most <b>helium</b> was formed during the Big Bang, but new <b>helium</b> is being created {{as a result of the}} nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, <b>helium</b> is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of <b>helium</b> nuclei. This radiogenic <b>helium</b> is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> leaks through cracks {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gas permeation through a bulk material. While <b>helium</b> has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and synthetic materials, inert gases such as <b>helium</b> will not permeate most bulk metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> {{produced}} between 1930 and 1945 {{was about}} 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for airships. In 1945, {{a small amount}} of 99.9% <b>helium</b> was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% <b>helium</b> were available.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Qatar {{started up}} the world's largest <b>helium</b> unit, {{although}} the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected <b>helium</b> production there. 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the <b>helium</b> business, following years of renowned shortages. Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, <b>helium</b> volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.|$|E
5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of <b>helium</b> by volume is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new <b>helium</b> because most <b>helium</b> in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes. In the Earth's heterosphere, {{a part of the}} upper atmosphere, <b>helium</b> and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.|$|E
5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which {{is connected to}} a reservoir of heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid <b>helium</b> leaks easily but through which non-superfluid <b>helium</b> cannot pass. If {{the interior of the}} container is heated, the superfluid <b>helium</b> changes to non-superfluid <b>helium.</b> In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid <b>helium,</b> superfluid <b>helium</b> leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>helium</b> on Earth is {{a result}} of {{radioactive}} decay. <b>Helium</b> is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite, pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles (<b>helium</b> nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of <b>helium</b> are generated per year throughout the lithosphere. in Natural Sources of <b>Helium</b> |journal = Phys. Rev. |volume=74|issue= 11 |pages= 1590–1594 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.1590|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74.1590A }} In the Earth's crust, the concentration of <b>helium</b> is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because <b>helium</b> is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of <b>helium</b> on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial <b>helium</b> is extracted. The concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm to more than 7% in a small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|One {{industrial}} application for <b>helium</b> is leak detection. Because <b>helium</b> diffuses through solids three {{times faster than}} air, it {{is used as a}} tracer gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and high-pressure containers. The tested object is placed in a chamber, which is then evacuated and filled with <b>helium.</b> The <b>helium</b> that escapes through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (<b>helium</b> mass spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10 Pa·m3/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called <b>helium</b> integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with <b>helium</b> and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{government}} {{bought the}} Cliffside Gas Field with high <b>helium</b> content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo <b>Helium</b> plant two years later. The plant {{was the sole}} producer of commercial <b>helium</b> {{in the world for}} a number of years. The U.S. National <b>Helium</b> Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.|$|E
5|$|After hydrogen, <b>helium</b> is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after <b>helium.</b> This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most <b>helium</b> in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new <b>helium</b> are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. <b>Helium</b> was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for <b>helium</b> for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The <b>helium</b> mass spectrometer was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into <b>helium,</b> creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of <b>helium</b> in the core. Eventually the <b>helium</b> content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate <b>helium</b> core.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National <b>Helium</b> Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's <b>helium.</b> The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} <b>helium</b> in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New <b>helium</b> plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with <b>helium</b> for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, <b>helium</b> {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where <b>helium</b> is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of <b>helium</b> to launch.|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud state in <b>helium</b> accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of <b>helium</b> atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (<b>helium</b> nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of <b>helium</b> with hydrogen or another <b>helium</b> nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and <b>helium</b> concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> at low {{temperatures}} {{is used in}} cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications. As examples of applications, liquid <b>helium</b> is used to cool certain metals to the extremely {{low temperatures}} required for superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of liquid <b>helium</b> to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> is {{also used}} in some hard disk drives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of <b>helium,</b> or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of <b>helium</b> are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} <b>helium</b> monatomic molecules, <b>helium</b> diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save <b>helium,</b> that 0.1% of the world's <b>helium</b> demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's <b>helium</b> demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. <b>Helium</b> can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical method of production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of <b>helium</b> {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in <b>helium</b> dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, <b>helium</b> I and <b>helium</b> II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Helium,</b> {{mixed with}} a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for thermoacoustic {{refrigeration}} due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio and low Prandtl number. The inertness of <b>helium</b> has environmental advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to ozone depletion or global warming.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous <b>helium</b> was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for <b>helium</b> II. In this model, liquid <b>helium</b> below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of <b>helium</b> atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of <b>helium</b> atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are <b>helium</b> nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, <b>helium</b> was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because <b>helium</b> does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of <b>helium</b> in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{approximately}} 169 million standard {{cubic meters}} (SCM) of <b>helium</b> were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from <b>helium</b> reserves with approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from Algeria, {{and most of}} the remainder from Russia, Poland and Qatar. By 2013, increases in <b>helium</b> production in Qatar (under the company RasGas managed by Air Liquide) had increased Qatar's fraction of world <b>helium</b> production to 25%, and made it the second largest exporter after the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, most <b>helium</b> is {{extracted}} from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field in Texas. Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National <b>Helium</b> Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off, {{and is expected}} to be largely depleted by 2021, under the October 2013 Responsible <b>Helium</b> Administration and Stewardship Act (H.R. 527).|$|E
5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after <b>helium.</b> It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid <b>helium</b> and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than <b>helium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neon, as liquid or gas, is {{relatively}} expensive– for small quantities, {{the price of}} liquid neon can be more than 55 times that of liquid <b>helium.</b> Driving neon's expense is the rarity of neon, which unlike <b>helium,</b> can only be obtained from air.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid <b>helium,</b> which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid <b>helium,</b> also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid <b>helium</b> and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>helium</b> has a brown {{shoulder}} (RAL 9008).|$|E
