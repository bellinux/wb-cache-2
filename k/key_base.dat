At Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell. Overnight, the Navy landed additional reinforcements, and Grant counter-attacked. Grant and the Union won a decisive victory—the first battle with the high casualty rates that would repeat over and over.

40|$|Abstract — The pre-shared <b>key</b> <b>based</b> {{mechanisms}} for Transport Layer Security (TLS) were recently standardized by the IETF {{to extend the}} set of ciphersuites by utilizing existing key management infrastructures. The benefit of pre-shared based mechanisms is the avoidance or reduction of the cryptographic operations used in public-key based mechanisms. However, so far there are no performance measurements for pre-shared <b>key</b> <b>based</b> ciphersuites available. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis and performance comparison between the pre-shared key exchange mechanisms and the standard public key exchange mechanisms in TLS. Our performance metrics are processing time and transmitted amount of data for a handshake establishment. Furthermore, {{the interaction between the}} overall TLS handshake duration and the network environment is evaluated.

500|$|The {{construction}} of several airfields within the perimeter at Empress Augusta Bay began {{shortly after the}} landing. This work was conducted by eight United States Navy Seabee battalions and a brigade of engineers from New Zealand. An airfield capable of supporting fighters opened at Cape Torokina on 9 December, and a squadron of Marine fighters began operating from it the next day. Two airfields capable of accommodating large numbers of light and medium bombers were completed subsequently: Piva Uncle on 30 December and Piva Yoke on 9 January 1944. These were the closest Allied airfields to Rabaul, and were used to greatly intensify the air campaign against the Japanese positions there. The Japanese air units stationed at Rabaul were worn down by [...] frequent Allied air raids during early 1944, and the Japanese high command decided to withdraw them following a major attack on the <b>key</b> <b>base</b> at Truk in mid-February. This gave the Allies complete air superiority over the region.|$|E

The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees, many of them penniless, that strained Kolkata's infrastructure. During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook Kolkata as India's most populous city. In 1985, prime minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a [...] "dying city" [...] in light of its socio-political woes. In the period 1977–2011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front, which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world's longest-serving democratically elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a <b>key</b> <b>base</b> for Indian communism. In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, 2011, Left Front was defeated by the Trinamool Congress.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} public <b>key</b> <b>based</b> {{management}} scheme for secure sensor network operation namely S-PkSec (Public <b>Key</b> <b>Based</b> Security for Sensor Networks) and emphasizes detailed comparison with some similar type of schemes. Although {{there was a}} wide held belief of the incompatibility of public key cryptographic (PKC) schemes for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), some recent works have shown that, PKC or asymmetric <b>key</b> <b>based</b> schemes could be implemented for such networks in some ways. The major challenge of employing a PKC scheme in sensor network is posed by the limitations of resources of the tiny sensors. Considering this feature of the sensors, we enhance our previous work [1] with some effective comparisons and energy analysis with other two established asymmetric <b>key</b> <b>based</b> protocols. S-PkSec comprises basically of two parts; a <b>key</b> handshaking scheme <b>based</b> on simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key by a receiver node. S-PkSec allows both base-station-to-node or node-to-base-station secure communications, and node-to-node secure communications. Analysis and simulation results show that, our proposed architecture ensures a good level of security for communications in the network and could effectively be implemented using the limited computation, memory and energy budgets of the current generation sensor nodes. 1...|$|R
