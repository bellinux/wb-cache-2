5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{appearance}} to Paul was a vision {{and he makes}} no distinction with regards to nature in relation to {{the appearance}}s to the others in 1 Cor 15:5-8, it can be inferred that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> there were all of the same type or similar in nature i.e. spiritual visions and not physical encounters.|$|E

25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was told it was unlikely that West could hear him, he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope she could hear what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Edmund Wilson, {{writing in}} The New Republic in 1924, spoke without pretence for most readers of Stevens: [...] "Even {{when you do}} not know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> you know that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> it well". This 'Wilson effect' is no doubt linked to Stevens' Adagia aphorism, [...] "Poetry must resist the {{intelligence}} almost successfully". [...] "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt" [...] is a good candidate for a Wilson award.|$|R

25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.|$|E
25|$|Later {{attempts}} at discovering whether Lucas had actually killed anyone apart from Powell and Rich were complicated by Lucas's {{ability to make}} an accurate deduction that seemed to substantiate a confession. In one instance, he explained how he had correctly identified a victim in a group photograph through her wearing spectacles; a pair of glasses were {{on a table in}} a crime scene photo shown to him earlier. There were also suggestions that the interview tapes showed that, despite Lucas's supposedly low IQ, he had adroitly read the reactions of those interviewing him and altered what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> thereby making his confessions more consistent with facts known to law enforcement. The most serious allegation against investigators, that they had let Lucas read case files on unsolved crimes and thus enabled him to come up with convincingly detailed confessions, made it virtually impossible to determine if, as some continue to suspect, he had been telling the truth to the Lucas Task Force about a relatively large number of the murders.|$|E
25|$|Eden's major mistake {{had been}} not to strike in July 1956 {{when there was}} {{widespread}} anger at Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, as {{by the fall of}} 1956 public anger had subsided, with many people in Britain having come to accept the fait accompli, and saw no reason for war. This was especially the case as Eden's claims that the Egyptians would hopelessly mismanage the Canal had proven groundless, and that by September 1956 {{it was clear that the}} change of management had not affected shipping. Even more importantly, Eden's obsession with secrecy and his desire to keep the preparations for war as secret as possible meant that the Eden government did nothing in the months running up to the attack to explain to the British people why it was felt that war was necessary. Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, that after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying.</b> Only one British soldier, however, refused to fight.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Virgin Carrying a Lantern" [...] is a poem from Wallace Stevens's {{first book}} of poetry, Harmonium (1923). It {{was one of}} the few Harmonium poems first {{published}} in that volume, so it is still under copyright. However, it is quoted here as justified by fair use to facilitate scholarly commentary. There are no bears among the roses,Only a negress who supposesThings false and wrongAbout the lantern of the beautyWho walks, there, as a farewell duty,Walks long and long.The pity that her pious egressShould fill the vigil of a negressWith heat so strong! This poem illustrates Edmund Wilson's maxim about reading Stevens, that even when you do not know what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> you know that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> it well. It also illustrates a variant, that even when you have qualms about what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> you know that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> it well. The image of the virgin carrying a lantern is crisp, contributing to a well wrought miniature. The role for the negress may be a racist stereotype. It is certainly more likely to be seen as such today than in 1923. Stevens surely meant it to be a playful poem, as the facile rhyme indicates.|$|R

500|$|Several {{lines in}} the episode were re-recorded. During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly voice would {{make it hard for}} viewers to {{understand}} what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed". Fox's standards and practices department made the show change the name to [...] "Dorkweed", which required David Duchovny to re-dub his line.|$|E

500|$|Minton {{tried again}} to expose what he {{believed}} to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, Rural Progress. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first guest}} stars {{to appear on}} the show were actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, reuniting for their first joint TV project in 33 years since the 1960s sitcom McHale's Navy. They {{appeared}} as SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's creative director, enjoyed the actors' roles in McHale's Navy, and they already wanted the two to provide the voices of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy when they were voice casting. Hillenburg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. When coming up for the right voice of Mermaid Man, Borgnine cracked his voice by mistake when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "evil!" [...] He said, [...] "By golly!
