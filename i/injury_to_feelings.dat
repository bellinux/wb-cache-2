5000|$|The Ontario Human Rights Code forbids {{discrimination}} upon various grounds which {{depend upon}} the circumstances. An adjudicator may order inter alia a respondent: to pay monetary compensation to the complainant [...] "including compensation for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> and self-respect"; <b>to</b> make restitution to the complainant [...] "including restitution for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> and self-respect"; and {{to do anything that}} will rectify the respondent's violation of the Code.

50|$|The {{day before}} the hearing, Mr Ballantyne {{notified}} the tribunal that he had restored to the company register Ms Andrews’s shareholding and directorship.

50|$|Sir John Donaldson {{held that}} loss {{of pride and}} <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> may not be compensated.

5000|$|The {{disparity}} between the sums of compensation awarded offends the proper relationship which ought to exist between pain, suffering and loss of amenity {{on the one hand}} and loss of reputation and <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> on the other.

50|$|The SFU {{administration}} was heavily criticized for its {{handling of the}} case, including criticism from the faculty.

5000|$|New Brunswick's Human Rights Act forbids {{discrimination}} upon various grounds which {{depend upon}} the circumstances. An adjudicator (Board of Inquiry) may order a respondent [...] "inter alia" [...] to compensate a complainant [...] "for any consequent emotional suffering, including that resulting from <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> or self-respect, in such amount as the Board considers just and appropriate".|$|R
5000|$|British Columbia {{is unique}} in no longer having a human rights commission. Complaints can be filed {{directly}} with the province's human rights tribunal. Under British Columbia's Human Rights Code, an adjudicator must order a violator to cease contravening the Code, and may order inter alia that the violator pay to the complainant an amount that the adjudicator considers appropriate [...] "for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> and self respect or to any of them".|$|R
5000|$|It was argued, {{following}} the obiter comments of Lord Hoffmann in Johnson v Unisys Ltd in March 2001, that claims {{could be made}} before an Employment Tribunal for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> arising from unfair dismissal. It was re-established {{that this was not}} what the law provided, in Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull City Council, July 2004 wherein the Lords confirmed that the position established in Norton Tool v Tewson in 1972, that compensation for unfair dismissal was limited to financial loss alone. The compensatory award element for [...] "ordinary" [...] unfair dismissal is subject to a statutory cap set, from February 2014, at the lower of £76574 or 12 months gross pay. Discriminatory dismissal continues to attract compensation for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> and financial loss, and there is no statutory cap.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{compensation}} for humiliation, loss of dignity, <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings,</b> etc. is {{at the discretion of}} the Authority and the Court and while there is no set maximum, there are indications that $27,000 is the upper limit. However, most amounts are well below this. Under the old ACC scheme, which was abolished in 1992, the maximum payout for personal injury was also $27,000.|$|E
50|$|The judge also {{rejected}} {{an attempt}} by Factortame to obtain damages for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> and aggravated damages caused by HMG's breach of Community law. Factortame had argued that claims for discrimination under European law were broadly comparable to claims for discrimination to individuals under the Race Relations Act 1976. This was not accepted by Judge Toulmin who emphasised that such damages were only awarded {{in cases where the}} breach in question had caused harm to the claimant's self-esteem.|$|E

[...] However, Faisal has stated that he only wants the Tribunal to order Maclean's to publish [...] "an appropriate response." [...] The Tribunal's hearing concluded on June 8, 2008.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a Muslim man won £20,000, after accusing Response of mistreating Irish and {{minority}} staff. He claimed staff frequently mocked Irish callers, and persistently made racist comments towards callers from the Student Loans Company. He was granted £15,000 for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> his <b>feelings,</b> a further £3,750 {{because the company}} did not follow the statutory grievance procedure, and an additional £3,718 in interest. The Student Loans Company also had to reimburse two students after their student loans were never received. Another staff member was responsible for this and subsequently left the company.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, New Zealand decriminalised sex {{work with}} the {{introduction}} of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003. Following this, in DML v Montgomery and M & T Enterprises Ltd the plaintiff alleged that the owner of a brothel at which she worked had sexually harassed her, causing humiliation, loss of dignity, and <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> her <b>feelings.</b> The Human Rights Review Tribunal found in her favor and awarded the plaintiff NZD $25,000; issued a declaration and a restraining order (to prevent a continuing breach); and ordered that the brothel’s management staff undergo training to understand why sexual harassment is unacceptable.|$|R
50|$|The Privacy Commissioner can {{investigate}} potential breaches of the IPPs, PRPPs, {{or other}} Privacy Act provisions, {{on his or}} her own initiative or on receipt of a complaint. The onus is on the complainant to establish that an agency’s action both breached a privacy principle and caused harm. Harm can include financial loss, adverse effect on rights or interests, or a significant <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings.</b> Breaches of principles 6 and 7, the refusal to grant access to or allow correction of information, need not establish harm as these situations are considered interferences per se. The Commissioner can decide to take no action based on issues of time, triviality, bad faith, or if another course of action is more appropriate.|$|E
40|$|The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations were {{introduced}} in England and Wales in 2006, seeking to prohibit age discrimination in employment and vocational training. This thesis assesses whether the legislation adopted is an effective mechanism by which to address age discrimination {{in the workplace and}} achieve the dual but contradictory objectives of the European Union Framework Directive on Equal Treatment of achieving equal treatment between age cohorts whilst encouraging the active participation of older citizens in the workplace. The thesis sheds light on this hitherto unregulated suspect ground of discrimination by means of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of all employment tribunal judgments which relate to an age discrimination claim over a three and a half year period. This study shows that very few claimants were successful if their claim of age discrimination was considered by a tribunal and there was considerable inconsistency of implementation and interpretation of the legislation by individual tribunals. Employers have quickly developed defences against claims of age discrimination in order to maintain their freedom to contract and the imbalance between the two parties was particularly noticeable with claimant credibility often under scrutiny – a process claimants appeared unprepared for. Regional discrepancies were found in terms of success rates and compensation awards. A gender award gap was found in both overall compensation and <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> awards, with women given smaller awards than men, whilst younger workers were given smaller awards than older workers. Legal representation made a substantial difference to success rates and compensation awards, but the majority of awards were low and many would not have covered legal costs. The low compensation awards do not provide an effective deterrent, as required by the Article 17 of the Directive. The legislation is particularly ineffective for those who claimed they had suffered multiple discrimination. Although an important first step in regulating ageist behaviour, the Regulations and the subsequent Equality Act 2010 will be unlikely to achieve the aims of the Directive as they provide little incentive for claimants to undertake the stressful process of making a claim under the legislation, which relies upon individual fault-finding...|$|E
5000|$|The Northwest Territories' Human Rights Act prohibits {{discrimination}} on the common grounds and on [...] "social condition". The section regarding publication (s.13) explicitly forbids any means of expression that [...] "is likely to expose any individual or class of individuals to hatred or contempt". The adjudicator may order inter alia a respondent [...] "to pay to a complainant an amount that the adjudicator considers appropriate to compensate that complainant for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> and self respect". If the adjudicator finds that the respondent [...] "acted wilfully or maliciously", or that the respondent repeatedly contravened the Act, the adjudicator may order the respondent to pay an amount not exceeding $10,000 as exemplary or punitive damages".|$|R
5000|$|Manitoba's The Human Rights Code allows an adjudicator {{to order}} inter alia that a {{respondent}} pay damages for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> or self-respect in an amount that the adjudicator considers [...] "just and appropriate", {{and to pay}} a penalty or exemplary damages (up to $2000 {{in the case of}} an individual respondent; up to $10,000 in any other case) if malice or recklessness is involved. Manitoba's Code is unique in having an [...] "analogous grounds" [...] provision. Complaints can be based not only on the listed grounds (such as sex, age, national origin, etc.), but also on grounds analogous to the listed ones. For example, the Manitoba Human Rights Commission currently accepts complaints based on gender identity.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the leading}} legal {{decisions}} of the NIRC was Norton Tool Co Ltd v Tewson 1972 ICR, in which Donaldson J ruled that damages for wrongful dismissal only extended to financial loss, and that compensation was not available for non-pecuniary losses, such as <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> pride or <b>feelings.</b> This position was doubted by Lord Hoffmann in Johnson v Unisys Ltd 2003 1 AC 518, but upheld in Dunnachie v Kingston-upon-Hull City Council 2004 UKHL 36.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{pervasive}} failure by investment tribunals to grasp the singularly compensatory nature of moral damages awarded to investors. The failure to distinguish moral damages from other forms of reparation such as satisfaction and restitution [...] never mind punitive damages [...] has led to various doctrinal and practical difficulties {{in the treatment of}} moral damages. Moral damages have enjoyed a long history in public international law. In that tradition, the venerable Lusitania decision defined moral damages as compensation “for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> his <b>feelings,</b> humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> his credit or to his reputation,” thereby identifying those injuries remedied by moral damages as mental or reputational injuries. Significantly, that decision emphasized that moral damages “are very real” despite their intangible nature, which “affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, a local Knights of Columbus {{council in}} Port Coquitlam, BC, was fined $1,000. The Council's Hall Manager signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn but canceled it after they became aware that it was for a same-sex wedding reception. The two women said they were unaware that the facility was affiliated with the Catholic Church. The local council responded that the hall is on the same compound as a parish church and there were Catholic symbols such as a picture of the Pope and a crucifix inside. The tribunal ruled the Council was within its rights to refuse to rent it based on their religious convictions but fined them [...] "for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> dignity, <b>feelings</b> and self-respect" [...] of the women.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 a {{tribunal}} found Schwartz {{guilty of}} victimisation by an employment tribunal after he publicly implied that {{two members of}} Brunel staff had made unwarranted claims against the university. [...] In 2005, after the two staff members had lost claims of race discrimination against the university, Professor Schwartz emailed all of the staff criticising the pair (although neither were named). Bemoaning the expense of defending the cases, {{he referred to the}} two as having made [...] "unwarranted demands for money" [...] and described their claims as [...] "unfounded", [...] "unmeritorious" [...] and [...] "futile". The tribunal concluded that the claimants' sense of grievance was reasonable and justified: [...] "Professor Schwartz's assertion that the claimants had made unwarranted demands for money was an implicit assertion of dishonesty on their part," [...] it said. The earlier tribunal, while dismissing the cases of discrimination, had accepted that they were made in good faith. The tribunal awarded the two claimants £7,500 each as compensation for <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> their <b>feelings,</b> and said that, as Professor Schwartz and the university were equally responsible, so each should be liable for half of each award.|$|R
40|$|The case of proselytism {{presents}} {{a tangle of}} competing claims: on the one hand, the rights of proselytizers to {{free exercise of religion}} and freedom of speech; on the other hand, the rights of targets of proselytism to change their religion, peacefully to have or maintain a particular religious tradition, and to be free from <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> religious <b>feelings.</b> Clashes between these claims of right are today generating acute tensions in relations between States and peoples, a state of affairs starkly illustrated by the recent Danish cartoons controversy. Irrespective of their resolution in any particular domestic legal system, how should such conflicts be addressed as a matter of international law? In noticing that surpisingly little {{attention has been paid to}} this question in the literature, this Article argues that the key to unlocking the puzzle is to recognize that the right to freedom of religion and belief generates competing claims not only with other fundamental rights such as free speech, but within the right to religious liberty itself. This insight suggests at least three challenges to theories of rights in the Lockean and Kantian traditions: first, the problem of the incommensurability of values which the liberal algebra of rights is unable to reconcile; second, the complex conceptual problems associated with rights foundationalism; and third, the intrinsic value of communal goods and their relationship to personal autonomy. Once these limitations and blindspots in rights discourse are acknowledged, a value pluralist approach is argued to offer a preferable path by allowing us to reimagine liberal theory in intersubjective and hermeneutic terms...|$|R
