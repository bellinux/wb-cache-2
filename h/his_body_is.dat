5|$|The Reformed {{confessions of}} faith, {{official}} {{statements of the}} beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper.

Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> locally present.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also {{alluded to}} in the epic Mahabharata.

In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man. In Book XIII, Shiva preaches to Parvati that half of <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> made up of her body.|$|E
