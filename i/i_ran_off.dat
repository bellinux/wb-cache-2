6000|$|Mrs. Micawber having now {{raised her}} voice into a perfect scream, I was so frightened that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to the club-room, and {{disturbed}} Mr. Micawber {{in the act of}} presiding at a long table, and leading the chorus of ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Allie, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> with Durade {{before you}} were born," [...] began the mother, swiftly, as if she must hurry out her secret. [...] "Durade is not your father.... Your name is Lee. Your father is Allison Lee. I've heard he's a rich man now.... Oh, I want to get back--to give you to him--to beg his forgiveness.... We were married in New Orleans in 1847. My father made me marry him. I never loved Allison Lee. He was not a kind man--not the sort I admired.... I met Durade. He was a Spaniard--a blue-blooded adventurer. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> with him. We joined the gold-seekers {{traveling}} to California. You were born out there in 1850.... It has been a hard life. But I taught you--I did all I could for you. I kept my secret from you--and his!... Lately I could endure it no longer. I've run off from Durade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But this wasn't harness or {{anything}} that jingled," [...] said the young mule. [...] "You know I don't mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and they fell {{up and down the}} lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldn't find my driver, and I couldn't find you, Billy, so <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> with--with these gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mus'r Jingle and Miss Rachael, in a po'-chay, from Blue Lion, Muggleton. I was there; but I couldn't stop 'em; so <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> to tell 'ee.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{have any}} books to read, {{and all the}} spare time <b>I</b> get <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> into the woods; that rests me better than stories," [...] {{answered}} Phebe, as she finished one job and began on another.|$|R
6000|$|... "What fun you'd have! I wish <b>I</b> could <b>run</b> <b>off</b> too," [...] said Jo, forgetting {{her part}} of mentor in lively visions of martial {{life at the}} capital.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, that is {{the game}} I am going to play when I go back. We worked in a {{different}} direction last time and brought it off. I think we might have stopped safely enough, but I had particular reasons for wanting to get here out of the way, so I tell you <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> the track and came over here. Do you think that game could be played here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ran off more'n a month ago. Page {{was good}} enough, but too strict. I didn't like it, so I cut {{away down the}} river {{with a man who}} was going in his boat. That's why they couldn't tell where I'd gone. When I left the man, I worked {{for a couple of weeks}} with a farmer, but I thrashed his boy, and then the old man thrashed me, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> again and walked here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You men {{can bear}} anything," [...] replied the lady. [...] "Parting or danger are nothing to you. Own {{now that you}} were going to join the army and leave us to our fate. I know you were--something tells me you were. I was so frightened, when the thought came into my head (for I do {{sometimes}} think of you when I am alone, Mr. Joseph), that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> immediately to beg and entreat you not to fly from us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] Richard went on, [...] "I'm groping about a bit. I don't understand. Forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> the track. I'm not forgetting our friendship, Maderstrom, or what I owe to {{you since}} you came and found me at Wittenburg. But for all that, you {{have served in}} the German Army and are an enemy, and I {{want to know what}} you are doing here, in England, in my brother-in-law's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind me; I'll {{take care}} of the house for you if you want to go. You may be sure <b>I</b> won't <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with the {{children}} or steal the spoons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Toby--and {{one quick}} little sob popped right {{up from his}} heart and out before {{he was aware of}} it--"I learned to ride because I had to, but I never give up runnin' away. I must see Uncle Dan'l, an' tell him how sorry I am for what I did; an' if he won't have {{anything}} to say to me I'll come back; but if he'll let me I'll stay there, an' I'll be so good that by 'n' by he'll forget that <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>off</b> an' left him without sayin' a word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know--but I did--do a lot. I {{was sixteen}} then. We quarreled. And <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> {{up here to}} punch cows. But after a while I wrote home to mother and my sister. Since then they've tried to coax me to come home. This letter's from the old man himself. Gee!... Well, he says he's had to knuckle. That he's ready to forgive me. But I must come home and take charge of his ranch. Isn't that great?... Only I can't go. And I couldn't--I couldn't ever ride a horse again--if I did go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he talks}} very quick, M. Henri; but he wouldn't let himself down to speak {{a word to}} me till I told him I was aide-de-camp-in-chief to the generalissimo of the Vendean army; and then he took off the greasy little cap he wears, {{told me that his}} name was Auguste Emile Septimus Plume, and said he was most desirous to drink a cup of wine with me in the next estaminet. Then <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to you, telling him I would return again as soon as I had seen that all was right at the guard-house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{he saved}} ever {{so many more}} people at the same time, who would likely have been all lost if he hadn't swum off to 'em with the rocket-line, {{and while he was}} doing that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to call out the lifeboat, an' didn't they get her out and launch her with a will--for you see I had to run three miles, and though I went like the wind they couldn't call out the men and launch her in a minute, you know; but there was no delay. We were in good time, and saved the whole of 'em-- {{passengers}} and crew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am. You're no fool. An' I believe you're square. I've got Anson and {{his gang}} corralled. You can't slip me--not in these woods. <b>I</b> could <b>run</b> <b>off</b> your horses--pick you off one by one--or turn the cougar loose on you at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If the kid hadn’t been in {{this state}} <b>I</b> would have <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with him—to you—into the woods—anywhere. Oh, Davy! will he die?’ she cried aloud suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say,' he stammered--'I say, I {{hope you}} don't think <b>I</b> had <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with your {{winnings}} for good! The croupier wouldn't give them up, you know, so I had to grab them and run. They came to exactly two louis. You put on five francs, you know, {{and you get}} seven times your stake. I--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} to tell, Major. When the lariat broke up at the Devil's Chimney and I couldn't make you reply to my calls <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to get help and a rope. I {{intended}} to ride your mare back to camp, but when I got to where the mare had been tethered I found her gone and this bay loafing around in her place. I got on the bay, but, instead of riding to camp, the animal ran away with me and brought me here. These fellows were mighty rough on me, and that man was going to split my head open when you came along {{in the nick of}} time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{of course}} I saw it all, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> {{as hard as}} my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always {{answered}} me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" [...] He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.|$|E
60|$|I was {{so shocked}} by the {{contents}} of this heart-rending letter, that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> directly towards the little hotel {{with the intention of}} taking it on my way to Doctor Strong's, and trying to soothe Mr. Micawber with a word of comfort. But, half-way there, I met the London coach with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the very picture of tranquil enjoyment, smiling at Mrs. Micawber's conversation, eating walnuts out of a paper bag, with a bottle sticking out of his breast pocket. As they did not see me, I thought it best, all things considered, not to see them. So, with a great weight taken off my mind, I turned into a by-street that was the nearest way to school, and felt, upon the whole, relieved that they were gone; though I still liked them very much, nevertheless.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{at once to}} {{the bench}} in the cottonwoods. I'll meet you there. My heart is breaking. It's a lie--a lie--what they say. I'll swear you were with me the night the boat was cut adrift. I KNOW you didn't do that. I know who.... Oh, come! I will stick to you. <b>I</b> will <b>run</b> <b>off</b> with you. <b>I</b> love you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you talk}} to me like that, Macumazahn," [...] she answered, {{stamping}} her foot, [...] "when you know well it is your fault if I married anyone? Piff! I hate them all, and, since my father would only beat me if I took my troubles to him, <b>I</b> will <b>run</b> <b>off,</b> and live in the wilderness alone and become a witch-doctoress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] said Emlyn. [...] "He had got no surplice, and I {{knew him}} for a prick-eared Roundhead! <b>I</b> should have <b>run</b> <b>off</b> home if you had not held me, Patience. I'll never go there again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{must tell}} you," [...] persisted Emlyn. [...] "I {{used to see}} Dick Glass among Lord Goring's troopers, and he is from our parts, {{and he has been}} with Prince Rupert. There was a plot, I know there is, and both the Master Ayliffes are in it, and we were to go and raise Worcestershire, only they wanted money, and Dick was to--to wed me--and set us across the river this morning, when they had got the treasure. 'Twas for the King. And now they are all gone, Master Philip and all, and master says they are flibustiers, and pirates, and robbers; and Mrs. Lightfoot's boy came and said Stead Kenton was shot dead at his house door, and then I was neither to have nor to hold, but <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> here like one distraught, for I never loved anyone like you Stead." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this long}} while I {{had not given}} a thought to Mrs Bowater. We stood before her at last in her oil-cloth passage, like Adam and Eve in the Garden. Her oldest bonnet on her head, she {{was just about to}} set off to the police station. And instead of showing her {{gratitude}} that her anxieties on my account were over, Mrs Bowater cast us the blackest of looks. Leaving Mr Anon to make our peace with her, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to change my clothes. As I emerged from my bedroom, he entered at the door, in an old trailing pilot coat many sizes too large for him, and I found to my astonishment that he and my landlady had become the best of friends. I marvelled. This little achievement of Mr Anon's made me like him--all of a burst--ten times as much, I believe, as he would have been contented that I should love him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{did right}} to hold fast to each other," [...] I said: {{as if the}} monster- {{splinters}} were living things, and could hear me. [...] "I think, scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, {{there must be a}} little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay." [...] As I looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily {{in that part of the}} sky which filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> again.|$|E
2500|$|He told a {{story in}} the words of the great man: [...] "Ah hit George Hirst bang on't kneecap; and Ah'll swear to me dying day he was in front – ball would a knocked all 3 stumps down. But umpire gives it [...] "not out" [...] and then George hits me over the ropes and t'crowd sarcastic like shouts [...] "Ow's That?" [...] and next ball he hits me again over the ropes and crowd shouts [...] "Ow's that?" [...] again so I knocked his middle stump flying in two and Ah brandishes 'em at crowd. [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>runs</b> <b>off</b> field and comes back with six new stumps and gives em to umpire and says, [...] "Here take these, [...] you'll need all bloody lot before Ah've done." [...] And he need four on em, Ah can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|The name of {{the captain}} of the sloop was Captain Maryon, and {{therefore}} it was no news to hear from Mrs. Belltott, that his sister, the beautiful unmarried young English lady, was Miss Maryon. The novelty was, that her christian-name was Marion too. Marion Maryon. Many a time <b>I</b> have <b>run</b> <b>off</b> those two names in my thoughts, like a bit of verse. Oh many, and many, and many a time! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well. This is the place. Yes, it is {{here that}} I meant you to come. I have been walking every day.... Don't excuse yourself--I understand. I am {{grateful}} to you for coming to-day, but all the same I cannot stay now. It is impossible. I must hurry off home. Yes, even with you standing before me, <b>I</b> must <b>run</b> <b>off.</b> <b>I</b> have been too long away.... You know how it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were kind}} to me at school, but the life was so dull and prim that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> in a gypsy dress of my own making. That {{is what it is}} to have gypsy blood in one. I was away for a week the first time, {{wandering}} the country alone, telling fortunes, dancing and singing in woods, and sleeping in barns. I am the only woman in the world well brought up who is not afraid of mice or rats. That is my gypsy blood again. After that wild week I went back to the school of my own will, and no one knows of the escapade but my school-mistress and Lord Rintoul. The second time, however, I was detected singing in the street, and then my future husband was asked to take me away. Yet Miss Feversham cried when I left, and told me that I was the nicest girl she knew, as well as the nastiest. She said she should love me as soon as I was not one of her boarders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; it {{was another}} cause that {{prevented}} their coming. Just as I reached the house I heard a scream, and Mrs. Harvey appeared at the casement calling for help. I forced open a window and ran up. I found that a robber had entered the house. He had seriously wounded the old servant, {{and was on the}} point of attacking Mr. Harvey when I entered. Taken by surprise, the man fled almost immediately. Mrs. Harvey had fainted. At first, we thought the servant was killed, but, finding that he lived, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> and fetched Dr. Hodges, who has dressed the wound, and thinks that the man has a good chance of recovery. As Mrs. Harvey had now come round, and was capable of assisting her husband, they did not accept my offer to stay and do anything I could. I said I was coming to you, and Mr. Harvey asked me to say that, although they were too much shaken to see you this evening, they should be glad if you would go round to them the first thing in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen years. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> to sea {{soon after}} they were married, like the young scalawag I was. But every time I {{come back from a}} voyage I'd head for here, even before I went home, and tell Mistress Selwyn all about it. Fifteen happy years! They had a sort of talent for happiness, them two. Some folks are like that, if you've noticed. They COULDN'T be unhappy for long, no matter what happened. They quarrelled once or twice, for they was both high-sperrited. But Mistress Selwyn says to me once, says she, {{laughing}} in that pretty way of hers, 'I felt dreadful when John and I quarrelled, but underneath it all I was very happy because I had such a nice husband to quarrel with and make it up with.' Then they moved to Charlottetown, and Ned Russell bought this house and brought his bride here. They were a gay young pair, as I remember them. Miss Elizabeth Russell was Alec's sister. She came to live with them a year or so later, and she was a creature of mirth, too. The walls of this house must be sorter SOAKED with laughing and good times. You're the third bride I've seen come here, Mistress Blythe--and the handsomest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I really can't say. <b>I</b> {{know she}} <b>ran</b> <b>off</b> {{as well as}} her hurt ankle would let her, but it may be that some of the Indians went after her. I had my hands so full I couldn't look," [...] {{concluded}} Henry.|$|R
6000|$|Nelly and Mr. Wrenn, Mrs. Arty and Tom, Miss Proudfoot and Mrs. Samuel Ebbitt, {{the last}} of whom kept ejaculating: [...] "Well! <b>I</b> ain't <b>run</b> <b>off</b> like this in ten years!" [...] They squatted about a red-cotton table-cloth spread on a rock, broadly {{discussing}} the sandwiches and cold chicken and lemonade and stuffed olives, and laughing almost {{to a point of}} distress over Tom's accusation that Miss Proudfoot had secreted about her person a bottle of rye whisky.|$|R
5000|$|Keith Levene (2001): “Putting Religion on {{the album}} with just vocals, I just did that as a producer. I thought that {{this had to be}} done so <b>I</b> said <b>Run</b> it <b>off,</b> John and I just {{recorded}} it. That was a cool idea.” ...|$|R
