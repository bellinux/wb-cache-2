5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with <b>epilepsy,</b> depending partly on the <b>epilepsy</b> syndrome present.

5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} <b>epilepsy.</b> It can affect people economically, socially and culturally.

In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, <b>epilepsy</b> is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with <b>epilepsy</b> from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with <b>epilepsy</b> denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E
5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with <b>epilepsy</b> have {{seizures}} that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures.

Mean seizure fre-quency significantly decreased (P 50 % seizure reduction) was observed in 15 patients of whom 6 were seizure-free (follow-up: 12 - 48 months). Higher responder rate was found among cryptogenic <b>epilepsies</b> and <b>epilepsies</b> symptomatic of cerebral malformation, whereas patients with posthypoxic-ischemic perinatal damage were poor responders. Lamotrigine discontinuation was mainly due to lack of efficacy (46 % of patients), whereas only 2 patients developed a transient skin rash and did not drop out. Lamotrigine represents a valuable treatment for severe partial <b>epilepsies</b> of childhood that have proved resistant to previous antiepileptic drugs. (J Child Neurol 2000; 15 : 671 - 674).

5|$|Diagnosis of <b>epilepsy</b> can be difficult.

5|$|<b>Epilepsy</b> is a {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In <b>epilepsy,</b> seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent <b>epilepsy.</b> People with <b>epilepsy</b> in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Epilepsy</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). <b>Epilepsy</b> may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. <b>Epilepsy</b> is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their <b>epilepsy</b> with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include <b>epilepsy</b> surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} efficacy and tolerability of topiramate (TPM) add-on therapy in Drug resistant (DR) Localization Related <b>Epilepsies.</b> METHODS: Forty-two patients (22 M and 20 F) affected by DR Localization Related <b>Epilepsies</b> entered the study after informed consent. Mean age was 32. 3 years (range 17 - 59). Twenty four patients (57. 1 %) were affected by Symptomatic Localization Related <b>Epilepsies</b> and 18 (42. 9 %) by Cryptogenic Localization Related <b>Epilepsies.</b> All patients were already treated with 14 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with plasma levels within therapeutic ranges. TPM was given as add-on treatment with doses ranging from 150 to 600 mg/day. After TPM titration all patients entered a follow-up period lasting at least 6 months (mean 9. 8 months). Patients were considered responders when seizures showed a 2 50 % reduction with respect to the 6 -month period preceding TPM add-on. RESULTS: In the whole group responders were 26 (61. 9 %) with 3 patients (7. 1 %) completely seizure free. No significant differences in seizure response were observed between Symptomatic and Cryptogenic <b>Epilepsies.</b> Side effects were reported in 13 patients (31. 0 %), consisting mainly of weight reduction. This phenomenon was generally transient and did not lead to discontinuation of TPM therapy.

Effective treatment should control seizures and improve EEG abnormalities. Current treatment options are presented. i 2007; 12 (Supplement 1) : 4 – 6 Catastrophic <b>epilepsies</b> of infancy include several syndromes {{with not only}} disabling frequent seizures but also major effects on normal development. Many of these are specific epileptic encephalopathies like West and Dravet’s syndrome with age-dependant expression, predictable responses to antiepileptic drugs and expected outcomes.
