5|$|The {{shape and}} {{energy of the}} land is {{significantly}} affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (<b>gravitropism),</b> orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|E

25|$|Brassinosteroids - are a {{class of}} polyhydroxysteroids, a group of plant growth regulators. Brassinosteroids have been {{recognized}} as a sixth class of plant hormones, which stimulate cell elongation and division, <b>gravitropism,</b> resistance to stress, and xylem differentiation. They inhibit root growth and leaf abscission. Brassinolide was the first identified brassinosteroid and was isolated from extracts of rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{of cells}} {{contributes}} to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources (phototropism), roots growing in response to gravity (<b>gravitropism),</b> and other tropisms originated because cells on one side grow faster than the cells {{on the other side}} of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} {{interaction}} (as {{distinct from the}} sum of the components) involves familiarity from childhood. [...] In a number of species, individuals prefer to associate with familiar individuals but prefer to mate with unfamiliar ones (Alcock 2001:85–89, Incest taboo, Incest). [...] By inference, genes affecting living together interact with the environment differently from genes affecting mating behaviour. [...] A homely example of interaction involves plants: Some plants grow toward the light (phototropism) and some away from gravity (<b>gravitropism).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to growth by cell division, a plant may grow through cell elongation. This occurs when individual cells {{or groups of}} cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length. [...] When cells {{on one side of}} a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend {{to the side of the}} slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light (phototropism), gravity (<b>gravitropism),</b> water, (hydrotropism), and physical contact (thigmotropism).|$|E
2500|$|Plant ABCB {{transporters}} {{have shown}} {{to transport the}} phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid ( [...] IAA), also known as auxin, the essential regulator for plant growth and development. The directional polar transport of auxin mediates plant environmental responses through processes such as phototropism and <b>gravitropism.</b> Two of the best studied auxin transporters, ABCB1 and ABCB19, have been characterized to be primary auxin exporters Other ABCB transporters such as ABCB4 participate in both the export and import of auxin At low intracellular auxin concentrations ABCB4 imports auxin until it reaches a certain threshold which then reverses function to only export auxin.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{ecological}} factor driving the local distribution of species is the vertical stratification of the environment: in woodland a continuous change in species assemblages {{can be observed}} from tree canopies to ground vegetation then to plant litter down to deeper soil horizons. This is a complex factor embracing both nutritional and physiological requirements, together with behavioural trends, dispersal limitation and probable species interactions. Some species {{have been shown to}} exhibit negative or positive <b>gravitropism,</b> which adds a behavioural dimension to this still poorly understood vertical segregation. Experiments with peat samples turned upside down showed two types of responses to disturbance of this vertical gradient, called [...] "stayers" [...] and [...] "movers".|$|E
50|$|<b>Gravitropism</b> is an {{integral}} part of plant growth, orienting its position to maximize contact with sunlight, as well as ensuring that the roots are growing in the correct direction.

50|$|However, {{there are}} {{indications}} that the model is not complete. The auxin gradient may not be relevant to early phases of graviresponse in roots, and it seems that the gravitropic response of shoots only involves local movement of auxin.Further research into phototropism and <b>gravitropism</b> is now investigating the roles of other plant hormones in the growth process and on the gravitropic and phototropic properties of plants using modern time-lapse photography.Although it is clear that, at least with roots, auxin {{plays a major role in}} <b>gravitropism</b> it seems that other hormones acting with auxin are also involved.Cytokinin may be an inhibitor of root cap growth that controls early <b>gravitropism</b> in roots.Ethylene seems to be important in <b>gravitropism</b> in shoots, perhaps affecting sensitivity to auxin or its rate of transport.|$|E
5000|$|Geotropism (or <b>gravitropism),</b> {{movement}} or growth {{in response to}} gravity ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Gravitropism</b> (also {{known as}} geotropism) is a turning or growth {{movement}} by a plant or fungus {{in response to}} gravity. It is a general feature of all higher and many lower plants {{as well as other}} organisms. Charles Darwin {{was one of the first}} to scientifically document that roots show positive <b>gravitropism</b> and stems show negative <b>gravitropism.</b> That is, roots grow in the direction of gravitational pull (i.e., downward) and stems grow in the opposite direction (i.e., upwards). This behavior can be easily demonstrated with any potted plant. When laid onto its side, the growing parts of the stem begin to display negative <b>gravitropism,</b> growing (biologists say, turning; see tropism) upwards. Herbaceous (non-woody) stems are capable of a small degree of actual bending, but most of the redirected movement occurs as a consequence of root or stem growth outside.|$|E

5000|$|Differential {{sensitivity}} to auxin helps explain Darwin's original observation that stems and roots respond {{in the opposite}} way to the forces of gravity. In both roots and stems, auxin accumulates towards the gravity vector on the lower side. In roots, this results in the inhibition of cell expansion on the lower side and the concomitant curvature of the roots towards gravity (positive <b>gravitropism).</b> [...] In stems, the auxin also accumulates on the lower side, however in this tissue it increases cell expansion and results in the shoot curving up (negative <b>gravitropism).</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{clinostat}} is {{a device}} which uses rotation to negate {{the effects of}} gravitational pull on plant growth (<b>gravitropism)</b> and development (gravimorphism). It has also been used to {{study the effects of}} microgravity on cell cultures and animal embryos.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} showed that for <b>gravitropism</b> to occur in shoots, only a {{fraction}} of an inclination, instead of a strong gravitational force, is necessary. This finding sets aside gravity sensing mechanisms that would rely on detecting the pressure of to the weight of statoliths.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the root cap is to enable {{downward}} growth of the root, with the root cap covering the sensitive tissue in the root. Also, the root cap enables geoperception or <b>gravitropism.</b> This allows the plant to grow downwards (with gravity) or upwards (against gravity).|$|E
5000|$|Mutants with altered {{responses}} to gravity have been isolated in several plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana (one {{of the genetic}} model systems used for plant research). These mutants have alterations in either negative <b>gravitropism</b> in hypocotyls and/or shoots, or positive <b>gravitropism</b> in roots, or both. [...] Mutants have been identified with varying effects on the gravitropic responses in each organ, including mutants which nearly eliminate gravitropic growth, and those whose effects are weak or conditional. Once a mutant has been identified, it can be studied to determine {{the nature of the}} defect (the particular difference(s) it has compared to the non-mutant 'wildtype'). This can provide information about the function of the altered gene, and often about the process under study. In addition the mutated gene can be identified, and thus something about its function inferred from the mutant phenotype.|$|E
50|$|Plant tropisms are {{directional}} {{movements of}} a plant {{with respect to a}} directional stimulus. One such tropism is <b>gravitropism,</b> or the growth or movement {{of a plant}} with respect to gravity. Plant roots grow towards the pull of gravity and away from sunlight, and shoots and stems grow against the pull of gravity and towards sunlight.|$|E
50|$|Plants {{could be}} said to exhibit a form of equilibrioception, in that when rotated from their normal {{attitude}} the stems grow in the direction that is upward (away from gravity) while their roots grow downward (in the direction of gravity) this phenomenon is known as <b>Gravitropism</b> and {{it has been shown that}} for instance Poplar stems can detect reorientation and inclination.|$|E
5000|$|Brassinosteroids - are a {{class of}} polyhydroxysteroids, a group of plant growth regulators.

They inhibit root growth and leaf abscission. Brassinolide was the first identified brassinosteroid and was isolated from extracts of rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen in 1979.|$|E
50|$|Both models fit {{the initial}} data well, but {{the latter was}} also able to predict bending from various {{reorientation}} angles. Compensation is less obvious in plants, {{but in some cases}} it can be observed combining exact measurements with mathematical models. The more sensitive roots are stimulated by lower levels of auxin; higher levels of auxin in lower halves stimulate less growth, resulting in downward curvature (positive <b>gravitropism).</b>|$|E
50|$|Drunken trees may {{eventually}} die from their displacement, and in ice-rich permafrost, the entire drunken forest ecosystem can be destroyed by melting. Tilted trees {{that do not}} topple over may recover by using <b>gravitropism</b> to resume vertical growth, thereby taking on a curved shape. The reaction wood formed by this process can be studied using dendrochronology using annual growth rings to determine when the tree was subjected to tilting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} hydrotropism is {{started by the}} root cap sensing water and sending {{a signal to the}} {{elongating}} part of the root. Hydrotropism is difficult to observe in underground roots, since the roots are not readily observable, and root <b>gravitropism</b> is usually more influential than root hydrotropism. [...] Water readily moves in soil and soil water content is constantly changing so any gradients in soil moisture are not stable.|$|E
50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although <b>gravitropism</b> may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and <b>gravitropism</b> allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{particular}} interest from a biological perspective are {{the effects of}} reduced gravitational force felt by inhabitants of spacecraft. Often referred to as [...] "microgravity", the lack of sedimentation, buoyancy, or convective flows in fluids results in a more quiescent cellular and intercellular environment primarily driven by chemical gradients. Certain functions of organisms are mediated by gravity, such as <b>gravitropism</b> in plant roots and negative <b>gravitropism</b> in plant stems, and without this stimulus growth patterns of organisms onboard spacecraft often diverge from their terrestrial counterparts. Additionally, metabolic energy normally expended in overcoming {{the force of gravity}} remains available for other functions. This may take the form of accelerated growth in organisms as diverse as worms like C. elegans to miniature parasitoid wasps such as Spangia endius. It may also be used in the augmented production of secondary metabolites such as the vinca alkaloids Vincristine and Vinblastine in the rosy periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), whereby space grown specimens often have higher concentrations of these constituents that on earth are present in only trace amounts.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} several {{cultivated}} plants that display altered <b>gravitropism</b> {{compared to other}} species or to other varieties within their own species. Some are trees that have a weeping or pendulate growth habit; the branches still respond to gravity, but with a positive response, rather than the normal negative response. Others are the lazy (i.e. ageotropic or agravitropic) varieties of corn (Zea mays) and varieties of rice, barley and tomatoes, whose shoots grow along the ground.|$|E
50|$|As plants mature, <b>gravitropism</b> {{continues}} to guide {{growth and development}} along with phototropism. While amyloplasts continue to guide plants in the right direction, plant organs and function rely on phototropic responses {{to ensure that the}} leaves are receiving enough light to perform basic functions such as photosynthesis. In complete darkness, mature plants have little to no sense of gravity, unlike seedlings that can still orient themselves to have the shoots grow upward until light is reached when development can begin.|$|E
