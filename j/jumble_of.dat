5|$|American {{explorer}} John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood {{visited the}} site in 1840, at which {{time it was a}} confused <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> overgrown ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci Siciliani , {{short for}} Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily {{in the years}} between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained {{the support of the}} poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo {{encompasses}} three ridges that intersect {{at their}} highest point. The Manjakamiadana royal palace {{is located at}} the summit of these hills and is visible from every part {{of the city and the}} surrounding hills. The Manjakamiadina was the largest structures within the rova of Antananarivo; its stone casing is the only remnant of the royal residences that survived a 1995 fire at the site. For 25 years, the roofless shell dominated the skyline; its west wall collapsed in 2004. In 2009, the stone casing had been fully restored and the building was re-roofed. It is illuminated at night. Conservation and reconstruction work at the site is ongoing. The city skyline is a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> colorful, historic houses and churches. More recent residential and commercial buildings and family rice fields occupy lower terrain throughout the capital. The Betsimitatatra and other rice fields surround the city.|$|E

5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E
25|$|A huge, rambling, quite scary-looking castle, with a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> {{towers and}} battlements. Like the Weasleys' house, it isn't a {{building}} that Muggles could build, because it is supported by magic.|$|E
25|$|Once {{past the}} forts, {{the head of}} the Federal column came under attack by some of the Confederate ships, while some of the vessels further back in the column were still under the fire of the forts. Because of their {{fragmented}} command structure, the Confederate ships did not coordinate their movements, so the battle degenerated to a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> individual ship-on-ship encounters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> French and British {{interests}} in the islands brought petitions for {{one or another of}} the two powers to annex the territory. The Convention of 16 October 1887 established a joint naval commission {{for the sole purpose of}} protecting French and British citizens, but claimed no jurisdiction over internal native affairs.|$|R
5000|$|In Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu, the {{inscription}} {{on the base}} of an idol of Cthulhu is first described as [...] "gibberish" [...] because it consists <b>of</b> unpronounceable <b>jumbles</b> <b>of</b> consonants, not meant for human vocal organs. It is [...] "R'lyehese" [...] the language of the Great Old Ones and their minions.|$|R
25|$|In Palermo, the Gothic and Romanesque cathedral complex had {{developed}} damage from earthquakes. In 1767, Fuga was entrusted with the reconstruction in the interior, the small subsidiary domes over the nave chapels, {{and the addition}} of a tall dome over the crossing. The interior has an unexpected simplicity relative to the eclectic <b>jumbles</b> <b>of</b> styles visible from the exterior.|$|R
25|$|The Gallowayford Farmhouse is now (2006) just a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> stones, however John Shields and his spouse Jean Guthrie farmed here in {{the mid-19th}} century, Jean dying on 4 October 1887 and John on 22 September 1908; they lost a daughter, Isabella {{at the age of}} 4 in 1862. James Miller farmed here previously, dying on 3 April 1813. They are all buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton. General Roy's map of 1747–55 clearly shows Gallowayford and Irvinhill.|$|E
25|$|The river passage {{continues}} from the Chamber of Columns meandering for about 200 m to the Big Rapids. This striking feature is formed from a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> huge boulders, well {{worn by the}} actions of the river. The river passage continues around a curve for about 250 m before flowing around a massive boulder into the sunlight at the Holuca Resurgence. The Web continues running through a canyon. About 250 m downstream the dry valley appears on the left bank.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{formally}} {{took control}} of the canal property on May 4, 1904, inheriting from the French a depleted workforce and a vast <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of it in poor condition. A U.S. government commission, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), was established to oversee construction and was given control of the Panama Canal Zone, over which the United States exercised sovereignty. The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Howard Taft and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The Discovery {{quadrangle}} {{includes some}} of the most distinctive relief-forming material on the planet, the hilly and lineated terrain unit mapped by Trask and Guest. The unit consists of a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> evenly spaced hills and valleys about equal in size. Most craters within this material appear to predate its formation, and their ages cannot be estimated: their rims have been disrupted into hills and valleys identical to those of the hilly and lineated unit; the floors of {{some of the}}se degraded craters contain hummocky plains material that resembles the hilly and lineated unit, except that the hills are fewer and lower.|$|E

25|$|Rocks of the North Cascades {{record at}} least 400 million years of history: {{time enough to}} have {{collected}} a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> different rocks. The range is a geologic mosaic made up of volcanic island arcs, deep ocean sediments, basaltic ocean floor, parts of old continents, submarine fans, and even pieces of the deep subcrustal mantle of the earth. The disparate pieces of the North Cascade mosaic were born far from one another but subsequently drifted together, carried along by the tectonic plates {{that make up the}} Earth's outer shell. Over time, the moving plates eventually accreted the various pieces of the mosaic onto the western side of North America.|$|E

In habitat dominated by brittle bush in Saguaro National Monument, all 103 white-throated woodrat dens were located within <b>jumbles</b> <b>of</b> rocks or under boulders. Ninety-one dens were located under boulders >7 feet (2 m) in diameter, and 12 dens were located under boulders <7 feet in diameter.|$|R
25|$|Another {{main problem}} that Giolitti {{had to face}} during his first term as Prime Minister were the Fasci Siciliani, a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily in the years between 1889 and 1894.

25|$|The book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture; with {{critical}} {{notes on}} authors who have recently treated {{the subject of}} planting by Patrick Matthew (1831) is not one long argument, but a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> issues. The book is divided into an Introduction followed by four different Parts and an Appendix consisting of Notes A to F that have been too long to be included as footnotes in the main text. That is, the main text has footnotes, but some of these refer {{to one of the}} notes A to F in the appendix. Parts I to IV are subdivided in various sections or chapters that sometimes also have roman numerals, so that Part I has sections I and II and Part VI has chapters I to VII.|$|E
25|$|Meigle 1 is a cross-slab. The {{stone was}} {{originally}} {{used as a}} standing stone two millennia before it was sculpted by the Picts, it has cup and ring marks low down {{on the back of}} the stone. The cross is Greek in style, with full circles at each of the four andles between the shaft and the arms. The inside of the cross is decorated with interlace patterns, the cross-point being decorated with spirals. The cross shaft itself is flanked by images of mythical beasts. It has an uncoordinated <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> symbols arranged around a hunting scene on the other side. Among these are images of a winged figure that perhaps represents a Persian deity and of a kneeling camel, as well as a Pictish Beast, salmon, a serpent and Z-rod, a mirror, a comb, a dog's head, animals and horsemen. This stone originally stood on the west side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 2. Meigle 1 may be the oldest stone at Meigle, possibly carved in the late 8th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> French and British {{interests}} in the islands brought petitions for one or other of the two powers to annex the territory. In 1906, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly. Called the Anglo-French condominium, it was a unique form of government. The separate governmental systems came together only in a joint court. Melanesians were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power.|$|R
60|$|Many gullies and canyons {{headed up}} on the slope of Coconina west of Silver Cup, and ran down to open wide on the flat desert.

5000|$|Coil's [...] "Gave Up" [...] remix {{picks up}} with a frantic rhythmic <b>jumbling</b> <b>of</b> Trent's vocals {{directly}} referencing the lyrics ("I cut myself to pieces"). Coil's long-time engineer and collaborator Danny Hyde states that the technique used was [...] "so ludicrous I'll keep it to myself". John Balance (of Coil) expressed his dislike of the chorus and decided they should take it in another direction, hence the vastly mutated form it ended up taking.|$|R
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been impoverishment and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E
25|$|British {{historian}} Richard J. Evans {{wrote that}} although the expulsions of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was done in an extremely brutal manner {{that could not be}} defended, the basic aim of expelling the ethnic German population of Poland and Czechoslovakia was justified by the subversive role played by the German minorities before World War II. Evans wrote that under the Weimar Republic the vast majority of ethnic Germans in Poland and Czechoslovakia {{made it clear that they}} were not loyal to the states they happened to live under, and under the Third Reich the German minorities in Eastern Europe were willing tools of German foreign policy. Evans also wrote that many areas of eastern Europe featured a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> various ethnic groups aside from Germans, and that it was the destructive role played by ethnic Germans as instruments of Nazi Germany that led to their expulsion after the war. Evans concluded by positing that the expulsions were justified as they put an end to a major problem that plagued Europe before the war; that gains to the cause of peace were a further benefit of the expulsions; and that if the Germans had been allowed to remain in Eastern Europe after the war, West Germany would have used their presence to make territorial claims against Poland and Czechoslovakia, and that given the Cold War, this could have helped cause World War III.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a <b>jumble</b> <b>of</b> false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
