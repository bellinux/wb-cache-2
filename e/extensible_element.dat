Using a topic-based publish/subscribe methodology, {{we are able to}} build a scalable system for managing real-time data streams produced by the California Real Time GPS Network. The architecture is based on atomic, <b>extensible</b> <b>elements</b> called filters that receive, modify, and republish 1 Hz GPS data streams in our deployment. Our filter approach can be extended to include sophisticated data analysis and event detection applications...|$|R

Some, like the Grid Vine, build upon core Vine to define more general concepts and <b>extensible</b> <b>elements.</b> Others, like the Globus Toolkit 4 Vine, are concerned with adding support for particular third party libraries and services.

40|$|The High Level Architecture (HLA) {{is widely}} used in defense {{applications}} as a common framework for modeling and simulation. The Federation Development and Execution Process (FEDEP) is a generalized process to build HLA federations from scratch. However, simulation model design, implementation, testing and execution defined in the FEDEP are time consuming and expensive. The Model Construction Environment (MCE) is introduced in this paper as a web-based system to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} federation development by reusing the existing Simulation Object Models (SOM) to build new Federation Object Models (FOM). To ensure the compatibility of the SOMs in a FOM, a Matching Algorithm is defined and tested. An <b>Extensible</b> <b>Elements</b> scheme is designed to help shape the characteristics of the FOM/SOMs. This study can contribute to more cost-efficient methodologies for the development and execution of simulation models...|$|R

In combination with a measurement of the overall stiffness of the dumbbell, this allowed characterization of the three <b>extensible</b> <b>elements,</b> the actin-bead links and the myosin. Simultaneously, another method, based on an analysis of bead position covariance, gave satisfactory agreement. The mean covariance-based estimate for the myosin stiffness was 1. 79 pN/nm (SD= 0. 7 pN/nm; SE= 0. 06 pN/nm (n= 166 myosin molecules)), consistent with a recent report (1. 7 pN/nm) from rabbit muscle fibers. In the triangle-wave protocol, {{the motion of the}} trapped beads during interactions was linear within experimental error over the physiological range of force applied to myosin (Â± 10 pN), consistent with a Hookean model; any nonlinear terms could not be characterized. Bound states subjected to forces that resisted the working stroke (i. e., positive forces) detached at a significantly lower force than when subjected to negative forces, which is indicative of a strain-dependent dissociation rate...|$|R

Moreover, after an architectural introduction of the core distributed software module, the Core Node, this paper describes a real application, named DART Node, based on it and designed and implemented within the DART (Distributed Agent-based Retrieval Tools) project, which carries out the idea of the design and implementation of a distributed, semantic and collaborative Web search engine, including mobile devices integration use cases. ...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for {{the necessary}} and sufficient conditions for stability of towing and mooring systems with several lines are derived {{based on the}} Routh stability criteria. These expressions are combined to provide physics-based relations for the bifurcation boundaries occurring in towing and mooring systems as a parameter is varied, and thus {{can be used for}} design of mooring and towing systems. Further, these expressions prove that several rules of thumb generally are not applicable. The special case of symmetric towing/mooring systems is covered as well. In this particular case, the analytical expressions can be simplified to derive a number of rules that can be implemented readily in design. The mathematical model consists of the horizontal plane maneuvering equations (surge, sway, yaw) of the towed/moored vessel without memory under steady current excitation, and a quasistatic model for the mooring/towing lines. The line static behavior is modeled by (i) nonlinear elastic strings (nylon, polyester); or (ii) heavy, inextensible catenaries. Other mooring line models (i. e. three-dimensional <b>extensible</b> finite <b>element</b> model) and external excitations (i. e. wind and second order mean drift forces) can be incorporated in the model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>extensible,</b> transaction oriented <b>Element</b> Manager System (EMS) architecture for IP connectivity management. The {{key aspects of}} the proposal are the extensibility, derived from the adoption of an object oriented, policy-based approach, and the transactional feature, which ensures both EMS repository data information and network configuration integrity. This means that an intended Connectivity Service is configured end to end in one atomic operation, as seen by the Network Management System (NMS), or not configured at all, {{if any of the}} steps of the ongoing operation fails. Management data and policies are stored as persistent objects in a common repository. This provides not only an inventory of the managed elements, but also a policy-driven application environment. The paper briefly describes the Information Model, the solution adopted, and presents a proof of concept implementation...|$|R
40|$|WordNet [4] is the lexical {{database}} for English language. A synset is a WordNet structure for storing senses of the words. Synset contains {{a set of}} synonym words and their brief description called gloss. For example, well, wellspring and fountainhead have the same meaning according to WordNet, so these three words are grouped in to one synset which is explained by a gloss "an abundant source". A known problem of WordNet {{is that it is}} too fine-grained in its sense definitions. For instance, it does not distinguish between homographs (words that have the same spelling and different meanings) and polysemes (words that have related meanings). We propose to distinguish only between polysemes within WordNet while merging all homograph synsets. The ultimate goal is to compute a more coarse-grained version of linguistic database. 2 Meta matcher Meta matcher is designed as a WordNet matcher, i. e., a matcher that is effective in matching WordNet with itself. It utilizes <b>extensible</b> set of <b>element</b> level matchers (see [1] for extensive discussion) and combines their results in hybrid manner, i. e., the fina...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} the development, analysis and subsequent simulations of mathematical models aimed at providing {{a basis for}} modelling atherosclerosis. This cardiovascular disease {{is characterized by the}} growth of plaque in artery walls, forming lesions that protrude into the lumen. The rupture of these lesions contributes greatly to the number of cases of stroke and myocardial infarction. These are two of the main causes of death in the UK. Any work to understand the processes by which the disease initiates and progresses has the ultimate aim of limiting the disease through either its prevention or medical treatment and thus contributes a relevant addition to the growing body of research. The literature supports the view that the cause of atherosclerotic lesions is an in inflammatory process-succinctly put, excess amounts of certain biochemical species fed into the artery wall via the bloodstream spur the focal accumulation of extraneous cells. Therefore, suitable components of a mathematical model would include descriptions of the interactions of the various biochemical species and their movement in space and time. The models considered here are in the form of partial differential equations. Specifically, the following models are examined: first, a system of reaction-diffusion equations with coupling between surface and bulk species; second, a problem of optimisation to identify an unknown boundary; and finally, a system of advection-reaction-diffusion equations to model the assembly of keratin networks inside cells. These equations are approximated and solved computationally using the finite element method. The methods and algorithms shown aim to provide more accurate and efficient means to obtain solutions to such equations. Each model in this work is <b>extensible</b> and with <b>elements</b> from each model combined, they have scope to be a platform to give a fuller model of atherosclerosis...|$|R
