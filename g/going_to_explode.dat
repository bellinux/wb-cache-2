2500|$|Theodore Modis says [...] "nothing {{in nature}} follows a pure exponential" [...] and {{suggests}} the logistic function {{is a better}} fit for [...] "a real growth process". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] {{is the time when}} the exponential trend is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.|$|E
5000|$|The young {{scientist}} Jor-El {{was born}} into this world. By his adult years, the mysterious [...] "Green Plague" [...] was killing Kryptonians by the thousands, and upon researching the matter, Jor-El discovered that its cause was growing radiation produced by Krypton's increasingly unstable core. This process was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cause the planet <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b>|$|R

25|$|While using Delhemme {{to speak}} for them, the hijackers asked for 27 tonnes of fuel; the {{aircraft}} needed approximately 9 tonnes to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers' cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged {{in a way that would}} cause it <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Charles Pasqua said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave Marseille, regardless of the consequences.|$|R
2500|$|On 22 November 2012, a {{reporter}} for Channel 5 revealed that filming for the storyline had commenced during the week. Scenes were filmed at FremantleMedia Australia's Melbourne studios, {{as well as on}} location in Kangaroo Ground. The episodes were filmed over four days; the wedding ceremony and the reception scenes were shot in the first two days, with the explosion being shot on the third day and the aftermath on the fourth. Morey commented [...] "It was nice that it was all broken up, as it meant that we could actually enjoy the happy wedding part! It was so lovely filming it, so it was quite surreal to know that it was all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> later on! When we did the aftermath, I just had to lie there so I was lucky, but everyone else was running around screaming. It was hectic!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{relief of}} González, Matt Albers, Sammy Solis, and Ryan Madson kept the Cubs from adding to their {{lead in the}} sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, giving up only a single and a walk and {{striking}} out a Cub, but against Lester, who pitched through the sixth inning and whose two-hit performance was the best postseason outing of his career, and Pedro Strop, who pitched the seventh for Chicago, the Nats managed only one base runner, when Strop hit catcher Matt Wieters with a pitch, the second time Wieters {{had been hit by}} a pitch in the series. Wieters did not advance beyond first. By the time the Nationals came to bat {{in the bottom of the}} eighth inning, they had accumulated only one run and four hits in the first 16 innings of the series, hitting 4-for-52 (.077). Losing 3-1 and with opportunities running out, they faced the prospect of traveling to Chicago for Game 3 down 2-0 in the best-of-five series with a badly slumping offense and needing to win three straight games, two of them on the road, to avoid elimination in the first round of the postseason for the fourth time in six years. After the game, Baker told the press that as the bottom of the eighth began, he was [...] "kind of bewildered" [...] by his team's offensive silence, adding [...] "I just knew in the bottom of my heart that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> for some numbers, which we've done all year." ...|$|E

While in the room we dared not change glances or even smile; but after seeing and hearing the wonderful laugh a few times we would steal off and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> some quiet spot sit in a circle and start imitating it, finding it a very delightful pastime.|$|R

That mine has been a perfect nightmare to me. There was no saying when it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> and although the Turks have worked hard at that countermine we set them to dig, I had little hope {{that you would be}} in time, as you had to take it right under the foundations of the tower.

60|$|There {{had been}} great consternation in Petersburg, {{as we were}} well aware, about a rumored mine that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> They knew we were mining, and they had failed to cut our mine off by countermining, though Beauregard had taken the {{precaution}} to run up a line of intrenchments {{to the rear of}} that part of their line fronting where they could see that our men were at work. We had learned through deserters who had come in that the people had very wild rumors {{about what was going on}} on our side. They said that we had undermined the whole of Petersburg; that they were resting upon a slumbering volcano and did not know at what moment they might expect an eruption. I somewhat based my calculations upon this state of feeling, and expected that when the mine was exploded the troops to the right and left would flee in all directions, and that our troops, if they moved promptly, could get in and strengthen themselves before the enemy had come to a realization of the true situation. It was just as I expected it would be. We could see the men running without any apparent object except to get away. It was half an hour before musketry firing, to amount to anything, was opened upon our men in the crater. It was an hour before the enemy got artillery up to play upon them; and it was nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcements from his right to join in expelling our troops.|$|E

Now they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> exhibit one of the modes of defending harbours. They have sunk four mines, of 300 pounds of gunpowder each, {{not far from where}} you see yon black specks floating on the water. The black specks are buoys, called circuit-closers, because they contain a delicate contrivance--a compound of mechanism and galvanism--which, when the buoys are bumped, close the electric circuit and cause the mine <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Thus when a ship-of-war sails against one of these circuit-closers, she is immediately blown up." ...|$|R
