40|$|We present 3 -D {{laboratory}} experiments constructed {{to investigate the}} pattern of mantle flow around a subducting slab under different boundary conditions. In particular we present a set of experiments, characterized by different conditions imposed at {{the trailing edge of}} the subducting plate (that is, plate fixed in the far field, plate detached in the far field, imposed plate motion). Experiments have been performed using a silicone slab floating inside a <b>honey</b> <b>tank</b> to simulate a thin viscous lithosphere subducting in a viscous mantle. For each set, we show differences between models that do or do not include the possibility of out-of-plane lateral flow in the mantle by varying the lateral boundary conditions. Our results illustrate how a subducting slab vertically confined over a 660 -km equivalent depth can be influenced in its geometry and in its kinematics by {{the presence or absence of}} possible lateral pathways. On the basis of these results we show implications for natural subduction systems and we highlight the importance of suitable simulations of lateral viscosity variations to obtain a realistic simulation of the history of subductio...|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{began to}} mobilise in August 1939, {{a few days}} before the Second World War began. Initially, it was assigned as Divisional Cavalry to the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, then to the 4th Cavalry Brigade commanded by Brigadier J. J. Kingstone, as part of the 1st Cavalry Division bound for Palestine. The regiment served there and in Syria, North Africa and Iraq. In North Africa, the unit served as a searchlight regiment in ports such as Tobruk and Benghazi. In January 1941, after 150 years, its horses were finally replaced by motorised transport. In June, it was involved in the successful campaign against Vichy French forces in Syria, in spite of being desperately short of equipment and serviceable machine-guns. In July 1941, the 4th Cavalry Brigade became the 9th Armoured Brigade and participated in the expedition into Persia, with the regiment fighting as motorized infantry. In December, it received its first <b>Honey</b> <b>tanks,</b> finally becoming an armoured regiment.|$|R
50|$|A new well, water {{treatment}} plant and storage tank were recently completed. The school and clinic are connected directly to the water plant. Individual wells, septic systems and plumbing were installed in 14 HUD homes during 1997. Sewage disposal is currently by septic <b>tanks,</b> <b>honey</b> buckets or privies, but major improvements are underway. A piped water and gravity sewer system is under construction, with household plumbing. 67 homes need water and sewer service. Most residents are dependent upon the washeteria for laundry and bathing. The city provides septic pumping services. Electricity {{is provided by the}} city of Akiak. There is one school located in the community, attended by 99 students.|$|R
