5000|$|Speed skates Speed skates differ {{greatly from}} hockey skates and figure skates. Unlike hockey skates and figure skates, speed skates cut {{off at the}} ankle and are built more like a shoe than a boot to allow for more ankle compression. The blades range in length on average from 12" [...] to 18" [...] {{depending}} on the age and height of the skater. Short track blades are fixed to the boot in two places once at the heel and the other right behind the ball of the foot. Long track skates, also called klap skates, attach firmly to the boot only at the front. The heel of the boot actually detaches from the blade every stroke. This is accomplished through a spring mechanism located at the <b>front</b> <b>connector.</b> Speed skates cannot be sharpened at a shop like most skates. Instead each skater sharpens {{his or her own}} skates. This is accomplished using a jig which is a frame to hold the skates in place while they are manually sharpened.|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with design of rear face fittings for the plant-expansion study currently being conducted {{we have been}} asked to determine if rear face pressurization is required for safety reasons and if so, how much. Pressurization of the rear face piping would be used to provide sufficient reverse flow to prevent process tube burnout in the event of complete loss of coolant supply to a single tube by virtus of a <b>front</b> <b>connector</b> failure. Consideration of the effectiveness of rear face pressurization, however, requires a more general look at the problem of single tube meltdown than that provided by considering front fitting failure alone...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Trailing cone {{method is}} {{generally}} used for atmospheric pressure measurement among airspeed calibration, {{of which the}} accuracy is not high enough and the hysteresis error is conspicuous. So a long-distance outboard precision airspeed calibration method is put forward. This paper focuses on the study on parametric design of static tube which is the sensing element of the newmethod. The flow field of the static tube is simulated and analyzed to get pressure coefficient Cp curve in flight test environment by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology. Based on the simulation result and considering the impact of <b>front</b> and rear <b>connectors,</b> the main geometric paramters of static tube is determined and optimized. The calculation result indicates that, pressure coefficient Cp of the static tube is less than 0. 0198...|$|R
40|$|The TOTEM Roman Pot Motherboard (RPMB) is the {{interface}} between the hybrids with silicon detectors and front end chips in the Roman Pots, and the outside world. The RPMB is glued in the vacuum flange which separates the vacuum chamber containing the detector hybrids, and forms the feed through between vacuum and atmosphere. The hybrids have a flexible part with on-board connector for connection to the motherboard. The motherboard is equipped with connectors to the detector hybrids from one side and <b>front</b> panel with <b>connectors</b> to the patch panel form the other side. The RPMB needs to provide power and control, clock and trigger information to the 10 hybrids. It acquires tracking and triggers data from the hybrids, performs data conversion from electrical to optical format and transfers the data {{to the next level}} of the system [1]. It also collects information like temperature, pressure and radiation dose inside the pot. This paper presents the TOTEM RPMB in detail...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 32 -channel digital output module, {{and the development}} of the hardware and software design. The microprocessor-based design allows versatility in output control in response to CAMAC commands. The unit may be tailored to different specific applications by modification of the internal applications software. CAMAC commands, which may be stacked for serial micro-processing, allow outputs to be selectively DC or pulse controlled, and to control other outputs at the start or end of a pulsed output. output pulse width may be pre-defined, or set within a range of values. Various outputs may be responding to any of the above commands concurrently. outputs to be pulsed (on or off) may be preset with width and trigger options, with execution deferred. Action may be later initiated on a set of channels using a selective pulse command to initiate execution of the preset sequences. The unit is a single width CAMAC module. Intended for general use as an equipment controller, each output is rated for switching loads of up to 75 volts and 100 milliamperes. DEVELOPMENT The Isolated Digital Output Module (IDOM) is a microprocessor-based CAMAC module. The IDOM was designed for use by the Stanford Linear Collider project (SLC) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The ability to preload and then initiate the execution of a sequence of variable width output pulses, makes this module useful as a process control sequencer. The outputs are arranged in two groups of sixteen, each group being brought out from the module through a 36 -pin <b>front</b> panel <b>connector</b> (see Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|A study {{employing}} twenty {{male and}} eleven female subjects {{was performed to}} determine maxi-mum hand grip torque that can be exerted during tightening or loosening of circular electrical connectors. A static, sustained three-second exertion {{was used as the}} strength criterion. Torque was applied to simulated connector rings with diameters of 0. 9, 1. 5, and 2. 0 inches and measured by means of a single-bridge torsional load cell. Other variables tested included the type of grip employed (full or fingertip), orientation of the <b>connector</b> (<b>front,</b> right side, or rear facing behind a barrier), the use of work gloves and chemical defense gloves, the height of the connectors (60 % and 85 % of the maximum reach height) and the direction of rotation. Hand grip torque strength was found to be directly related to connector diameters, with simi-lar strength patterns exhibited for tightening and loosening. Higher torque was exerted when the connectors were on the subject's right side, and tightening and loosening effort corres-ponded to flexing and extending the wrist parallel to the forearms. The use of gloves re-sulted in higher torque in most situations. little effect on torque strength. Connector height and direction of rotation ha...|$|R
50|$|The Teleputer was a {{range of}} {{computers}} that were suffixed with a number. Only the Teleputer 1 and Teleputer 3 were manufactured and sold. The teleputer 1 was a very simple device and only worked as a teletex terminal, whereas the Teleputer 3 was a z80 based micro computer. It ran {{with a pair of}} single sided 5Â¼ inch floppy disk drive; a 20Mb Hard disk drive version was available {{towards the end of the}} product's life. The operating system was CP/M or a proprietary variant CP*, and the unit was supplied with a suite of applications, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database and a semi-compiled basic programming language. The display supplied with the unit (both the Teleputer 1 and 3) was a modified Rediffusion 14 inch portable colour television, with the tuner circuitry removed and being driven by a RGB input. The unit had a 64Kb onboard memory which could be expanded to 128Kb with a plug in card. Graphics were the standard videotext (or teletext) resolution and colour, but a high resolution graphic card was also available. A 75/1200 baud modem was fitted as standard (could also run at 300/300 and 1200/1200), and connected to the telephone via an old style round telephone connector. In addition an IEEE interface card could be fitted. On the back of the unit there was a RS232 and Centronic connections and on the <b>front</b> was the <b>connector</b> for the keyboard.|$|R
40|$|The Fiber Optical Cable and Connector System (FOCCoS), {{provides}} {{optical connection}} between 2400 positioners {{and a set}} of spectrographs through optical fibers cables as part of PFS instrument for Subaru telescope. The optical fiber cable will be segmented in 3 parts along the route, cable A, cable B and cable C, connected by a set of multi-fiber connectors. The company USCONEC produces the multi-fiber connector under study. The USCONEC 32 F model can connect 32 optical fibers in a 4 x 8 matrix arrangement. The ferrules are made of a durable composite, Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS) based thermoplastic. The connections are held in place by a push-on/pull-off latch, and the connector can also be distinguished by a pair of metal guide pins that protrude from the <b>front</b> of the <b>connector.</b> Two fibers per connector will be used for monitoring the connection procedure. It was found to be easy to polish and it is small enough to be mounted in groups. Highly multiplexed instruments like PFS require a fiber connector system that can deliver excellent optical performance and reliability. PFS requires two different types of structures to organize the connectors. The Tower Connector system, with 80 multi-fiber connectors, will be a group of connectors for connecting cable B (Telescope Structure) with cable C (Positioners Plate). The Gang Connector system is a group of 8 gang connectors, each one with 12 multi-fibers connectors, for connecting cable B (Telescope Structure) with cable A (Spectrograph). The bench tests with these connector systems and the chosen fibers should measure the throughput of light and the stability after many connections and disconnections. In this paper we describe tests and procedures to evaluate the throughput and FRD increment. The lifetime of the ferrules is also in evaluation...|$|R
