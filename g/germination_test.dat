50|$|The {{results of}} a <b>germination</b> <b>test</b> are {{commonly}} expressed as germinative capacity or a germination percentage, which is the percentage of seeds that germinate {{during a period of}} time, ending when germination is practically complete. During extraction and processing, white spruce seeds gradually lost moisture, and total germination increased. Mittal et al. (1987) reported that white spruce seed from Algonquin Park, Ontario, obtained the maximum rate (94% in 6 days) and 99% total germination in 21 days after 14-week pre-chilling. The pre-treatment of 1% sodium hypochlorite increased germinability.|$|E
50|$|Seed {{collections}} {{arrive at}} the MSBP in varying states, sometimes attached to fruits, sometimes clean. The collections usually also include a voucher specimen {{that can be used}} to identify the plant. The collections are immediately moved to a dry room until processing can be conducted where the seeds are cleaned of debris and other plant material, X-rayed, counted, and banked at -20˚C. Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with Silica gel packets impregnated with indicator compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a <b>germination</b> <b>test</b> shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option.|$|E

So, {{the objective of this}} research was to evaluate the possibility of reducing the time for the <b>germination</b> <b>test</b> of Surinam grass seeds and to establish a method for dormancy breaking and the ideal temperature. Ten seed lots were submitted to the following treatments to overcome seed dormancy: control; substrate moistening with 0. 2 % KNO 3; and scarification with sulfuric acid (98 % 36 N) for 15 minutes. After the treatments, the lots were submitted to seed water content, germination and tetrazolium tests.

40|$|We {{studied the}} role of white-lipped and {{collared}} peccaries (Tayassu pecari and Pecari tajacu) as seed predators and dispersers in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil. The Atlantic rainforest ecosystem is highly threatened and has experienced dramatic declines in its populations of large mammals. Local extinctions can disrupt essential plant-animal interactions such as seed dispersion and seed predation.
