500|$|Conservative MP {{and animal}} lover Alan Clark was {{suspicious}} {{about the way}} Humphrey's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: [...] "Humphrey is now a missing person. Unless I hear from him or he makes a public appearance, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> has been shot." [...] This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Mrs Blair.|$|E
500|$|The Tet Offensive was {{launched}} prematurely {{in some areas}} on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of NVA/NLF attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared {{on the following day}} (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. [...] "The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue... <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he's</b> still shy, at heart. He {{used to be}} very sentimental, and {{was always}} talking Ruskin. I think if he hadn't talked Ruskin so much, Jenny Milbury might have treated him better. It was very priggish in him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I noticed, as I went last {{out of the}} room, that Slagg rose {{quickly and}} pulled a sheet {{off one of the}} beds. Afterwards, looking back, I saw him slip out and run down the passage in the {{opposite}} direction. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was about some mischief, but said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "His wife is {{the proper}} person to look after him," [...] Kerr interposed. [...] "Then I have a young fellow in the rail gang who could help; found him useful once or twice when the boys got hurt. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he's</b> had some medical training, though I didn't ask why he quit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He won't go home," [...] sighed the minister. [...] "He's {{determined}} to stay. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> would accept employment, {{if it were}} offered him in the right spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Harold; [...] "and {{had that}} tree not grown where it stands, and grown tough, too, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> {{would have made}} short work of Antonio too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{a perfect}} Babel of strange tongues; and he's the very {{man for the}} work, and I was ashamed I hadn't thought of him myself, for <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> needs the work." ...|$|E
60|$|He gallantly {{kissed my}} hand, made a neat little speech of acknowledgment, {{and took his}} leave. For {{the rest of the}} week I would not {{encourage}} Trottle by allowing him to refer to the House at all. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> was making his own inquiries about dates, but I put no questions to him.|$|R
2500|$|... ('Oh dear, I think I've shit myself.' <b>I</b> rather <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> did, he {{certainly}} shat up everything else.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not long since, I {{was coming}} home in the dark when I found Lance talking to Tom Shanks in the wood. Lance said he had caught the fellow poaching, and I thought it strange they should talk quietly. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> wanted me to tell Jim, but I did not. His grudge against Jim had been getting worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, though <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> {{has climbed}} to commit it, {{while others have}} been content to descend. The man himself behaved well yesterday, showing {{steadiness}} as well as spirit in the fray." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. To be sure. I am {{astonished}} indeed. I {{wonder he}} committed himself without seeing {{more of his}} way first. Now I think of it, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> always has admired you though, my dear.' ...|$|E
60|$|One of its minor tenets {{seemed to}} be that the one thing more sinful than giving an order was obeying it. At least, that was what McGoggin said; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> had misread his primers.|$|E
6000|$|... "François isn't {{much of a}} bookkeeper," [...] he remarked. [...] "One {{or two of the}} {{delivery}} slips have been entered twice, and at first <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> might have conspired with Oliva. Still, that's against my notion of his character, and I find he's missed booking stuff that had been given out, which, of course, wouldn't have suited the other's plans." ...|$|R
60|$|I slept {{far into}} the next day. Herky was in camp alone. The others had gone, Herky said, {{and he would not}} tell me where. He did not appear as cheerful as usual. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>he</b> had quarreled with his companions, very likely about what was to be done with me. The day passed, and again I slept. Herky awakened me before it was light.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot tell. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>he</b> {{will not}} consent to your going home till Mervyn is married; and Augusta wants {{very much to}} have you, for the season at least.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Featherstone hesitated, as if {{he wanted}} to take the other into his confidence, but shrank from doing so. Then he said with forced quietness: [...] "If this rogue knows as much as <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>he</b> can get my son arrested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but it's {{the youth}} of my sires that I find so strange in Barker. Only, theoretically, there's no Puritanism. He's a {{thorough}} believer in Sewell. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> could formulate Sewell's theology a great deal better than Sewell could." ...|$|E
6000|$|He smiled again. [...] "How very absurd!" [...] he said, with {{a superb}} {{compassion}} for the benighted Americans. By this time, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> began to feel {{that he had had}} enough of me. He got rid of me with an invitation.|$|E
6000|$|Kit made {{a sign of}} agreement. [...] "The fellow's getting {{dangerous}} and must be stopped. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he's</b> backing Bell and now he means to use his nephew; it's not altogether for Richardson's sake he wants to break your lease. Some day I imagine Osborn will find his agent owns the estate; but that's not our business. Well, Peter told me {{to remind you that}} you and he are old friends, and if a hundred pounds would be some help--" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 2. The Square of the Hypotenuse [...] "Who {{first called}} Reason sweet, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>he</b> {{was a man}} with very few responsibilities, no {{children}} to rear, and no payroll to meet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> why <b>he</b> was not cordial to me," [...] Nasmyth admitted. [...] "Still, the {{inference}} is so flattering {{that one would}} naturally feel a little diffident about believing that Martial's suppositions were correct." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he}} knew {{all there was to}} know. In this respect he was a good deal like Reddy Fox himself. That was because he was young. It is the way with young Ducks and Foxes and with some other youngsters I know.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may sing as {{loudly as}} you will, cantabit vacuus----," [...] {{answered}} the Master; [...] "but I believe the Marquis is too wise, at least too wary, {{to join you}} in such a burden. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> alludes to {{a revolution in the}} Scottish privy council, rather than in the British kingdoms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{little of}} both I fancy," [...] said the Colonel, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> is giving me up as a bad job. Ermine, there are ominous revivifications going on at home, and he has got himself rigged out in London, and had his hair cut, so that he looks ten years younger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell what}} you meant to do and couldn't sounds pretty weak, but I had two objects when I came home," [...] he said. [...] "I wanted to help Dick and {{keep him out of}} trouble; but the proper kind of help needs tact, and I haven't much. Besides, there's {{something}} peculiarly elusive about Dick; you think you have him, so to speak, in a corner, and the next moment he slips away from you. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he's</b> a good deal more clever than we imagine." ...|$|R
60|$|Was it at {{this point}} that <b>I</b> began to <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> was going to bore me? I rather think it was.|$|R
2500|$|... "It's a quite literal {{translation}} from Boberg, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>he</b> had the Hine work at hand because {{he uses the}} phrase 'how great Thou art.' Also, the music by Josephine Carradine Dixon is similar to Hine's. He added two verses of his own." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} {{had declared}} before this that I had not a particle of sentiment, in rather absolute terms, to my astonishment; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> meant that my legs did not ache just then, though I am not wholly {{a stranger to}} that sentiment. But I did not intend this for a sentimental journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{singular}} in `build,' as {{you call}} it," [...] returned Rose, laughing, [...] "but, I {{can assure you that}} he is a most excellent fellow in his way--worth a dozen of Josh. Do you know, Harry, that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> has strong feelings towards Captain Spike; though whether of like or dislike, friendship or enmity, I am at a loss to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{not only}} next to the largest, but is the stupidest," [...] {{continued}} Old Mother Nature. [...] "At least that is what people say of him, though <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>he</b> isn't as stupid as he sometimes seems. Anyway, he manages to keep well fed and escape his enemies, {{which is more than}} can be said for some others who are supposed to have quick wits." ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked with smiling penetration; and, on {{receiving}} no answer, added, [...] "She {{ought not}} to be angry with you, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> whatever <b>he</b> may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet." ...|$|R
60|$|The sole of a coon's foot is padded {{thick with}} fat and gristle, {{so that it}} must feel like landing on springs when <b>he</b> jumps; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>he</b> also knows the {{squirrel}} trick of flattening his body and tail against the air so as to fall lightly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is too bad," [...] {{said the}} captain, and then, {{listening}} for a moment, he said: [...] "I {{truly believe that}} Maka is snoring, too, and as for that black fellow over there, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>he</b> sleeps all the time. Miss Markham, you {{have been the only}} person awake." ...|$|R
