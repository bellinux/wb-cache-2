5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was upset with the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} from Charles, unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he expected her to be. She never sought <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Charles, and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E

5|$|The Socialist-dominated French {{authorities}} actively supported PADESM. The French characterized {{this support}} {{as an effort}} to champion the oppressed masses and strengthen their protection against exploitative Hova elites. Governor General Jules Marcel de Coppet provided the party with space in public buildings for meetings. PADESM candidates in the January 1947 provincial elections received <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> French settlers owing to the party's favorable disposition to the French administration.|$|E

5|$|After its founding, {{the school}} offered {{comprehensive}} secondary level Chinese education. It remained funded {{and supported by}} Tan Kah Kee until shortly before World War II. In 1934, Lee Kong Chian, son-in-law of Tan Kah Kee, became {{the chairman of the}} school's board and remained in his post until 1955. During his tenure, the school faced the threat of closure several times due to financial difficulties, but managed to survive due to strong <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> both Tan and Lee. Together they built a legacy, which the current school body commemorates them for.|$|E
5|$|After the Order emerged victorious {{from the}} siege, it {{received}} <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Europe, {{which was used}} to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications, which were designed along the Italian bastioned system. Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enceinte, with nine cavaliers and a ditch. The city was to be designed along a grid plan, and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{predominance}} of orthodox Islam in Palestine, the region contained numerous domed structures dedicated to Muslim patron saints, among which was the Mosque of al-Khidr in Deir al-Balah. In March 2016, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in the Gaza Strip began {{the restoration of the}} Mosque of al-Khidr with <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> UNESCO and the Nawa Foundation.

5|$|The Mosque of Islamic Solidarity was {{constructed}} in 1987 with <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the Saudi Fahd bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud Foundation. It is the main mosque in the city, and an iconic building in Somali society. With a capacity of up to 10,000 worshippers, it is the single largest masjid in the Horn region. In 2015, the federal authorities completed formal refurbishments on the mosque's infrastructure. The upgrades {{are part of a}} larger governmental renovation campaign aimed at all of the masjids in Mogadishu. To this end, the municipal authority is refurbishing the historic Central Mosque, situated downtown.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, Soviet {{secondary}} education institutes introduced tuition fees, and the scholarship fund was cut. Shanina received little <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> home and on 11 September 1941, {{she took a}} job in kindergarten No. 2 (lately known as Beryozka) in Arkhangelsk, with which she was offered a free apartment. She studied in the evenings {{and worked in the}} kindergarten during the daytime. The children liked Shanina and their parents appreciated her. Shanina graduated from college in the 1941–42 academic year, when the Soviet Union was in the grip of World WarII.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} governments in exile, which {{were forced to}} rely {{exclusively}} on <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the Allies, the Belgian government in exile could fund itself independently. In large part, {{this was due to}} the fact that the government in exile retained control of most of the Belgian national gold reserves. These had been moved secretly to Britain in May 1940 aboard the naval trawler A4, and provided an important asset. The Belgian government was also in control of the Belgian Congo, which exported large amounts of raw materials (including rubber, gold and uranium) which the Allies relied on for the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E

5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) ran {{off with}} Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, accompanied by Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After six weeks of travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her premature birth. Percy was alienated from his family and received little <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had a second child, William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra. The group spent the summer of 1817 with Byron at Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein. That fall, Percy's wife, Harriet, committed suicide, and in December Percy and Mary were married. In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the society}} {{presented}} a new code and system of bylaws {{for the government}} of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided <b>financial</b> <b>support</b> <b>from</b> the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.|$|E
