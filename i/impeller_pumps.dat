40|$|Background—The latest {{generation}} of left ventricular assist devices consists of nonpulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps.</b> In these small pumps, thrombus formation inside the device {{does not lead}} to thromboembolic end-organ dysfunction but may dramatically impair pump flow. We report on our experience with thrombus-related pump dysfunctions of the MicroMed DeBakey left ventricular assist device and its treatment. Methods—Eight of 22 patients with a MicroMed DeBakey VAD presented with a critically reduced pump flow. In 7 cases, an increased power demand indicative of progressive thrombus formation associated with the device was evident, whereas 1 case presented with thrombus formation within the inflow conduit associated with a very low power demand. Brief spontaneously resolving pump stops had been noted in 6 patients. All 8 patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), administered via an IV line. Results—Rt-PA lysis led to an increase of pump flow along with a reduction of power demand within a short time in all patients. No severe bleeding complications occurred. However, 4 patients experienced transient epistaxis. All patients could be discharged from intensive care immediately after discontinuation of thrombolytic therapy. Conclusion—Rt-PA lysis is a very effective tool for thrombus-related pump dysfunction in patients with <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps,</b> which renders emergency surgical exchange unnecessary in most cases.

The article gives the formulas and the algorithm to calculate the heat capacity {{of different types of}} <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps</b> when tested at the bench as ell as to determine the heating time of the liquid in the bench without external cooling. Based on analysis of the power balance of a centrifugal pump, it is shown that about 90 % of the pump unit-consumed electric power in terminals is used for heating up the working fluid in the loop of the test bench. The article gives examples of elementary heat calculation of the pump operation within the test bench. It presents the main types of systems to maintain thermal balance, their advantages, disadvantages and possible applications. The cooling system schemes for open and closed version of the benches both with built-in and with an independent cooling circuit are analysed. The paper separately considers options of such systems for large benches using the cooling tower as a cooling device in the loop, and to test the pumps using the hydraulic fluids other than water, including those at high temperatures of working fluids; in the latter case a diagram of dual-circuit cooling system "liquid-liquid-air" is shown. The paper depicts a necessity to use ethylene glycol coolant in the two-loop cooling bench. It provides an example of combining the functions of cooling and filtration in a single cooling circuit. Criteria for effectiveness of these systems are stated. Possible ways for developing systems to maintain a thermal balance, modern methods of regulation and control are described.

Secondly, a durable centrifugal pump with rolling bearing and axially reciprocating impeller has been developed, the axial reciprocation of rotating impeller makes the fresh blood {{in and out of}} the bearing and to wash the rollers once a circle; in such way, no thrombus could be formed and no fluid infusion is necessary, which may bring inconvenience and discomfort to the receptors. Finally, a permanent maglev <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> has been developed, its rotor is suspended and floating in the blood under the action of permanent magnetic force and nonmagnetic forces, without need for position measurement and feed-back control.

The same blade loading distribution was assumed for the full blades of both impellers, while the loading distribution of the splitter blades was modified until a close matching between the two head-capacity curves was achieved. The fulfilment of this performance requirement {{and the use of the}} same number of blades were needed to describe accurately the role played by the splitter blades in cavitation inception and development. Differently from other experimental comparisons, where previous requirements were not met, a noticeable improvement in suction performance was found at large flow rates but not at partial ones, where a small deterioration in suction performance was observed.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} dissertation aims to provide computational methodologies and to further the understanding of physical phenomena that will aid and improve the design of bladed disk assemblies from a structural dynamics standpoint. Bladed disk structures are found in {{a wide array of}} applications, including small <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps</b> andautomotive turbo systems; large gas, steam, and hydro turbines for power generation; and jet engines for military and commercial aircraft propulsion. Based on the nominal design, a bladed disk assembly is a rotationally periodic structure. If it is assumed that each disk-blade sector is identical, then the theory of cyclic symmetry may be used to analyze the dynamics of the entire structure based on one fundamental disk-blade sector. In practice, however, there are always small differences among the structural properties of individual blades, which destroy the cyclic symmetry of the bladed disk assembly. These structural irregularities, commonly referred to as mistuning, may derive from manufacturing tolerances, deviations in material properties, or non-uniform operational wear. Mistuning is known to have a potentially dramatic effect on the vibratory behavior of the rotor, since it can lead to spatial localization of the vibration energy. Spatial localization implies that the vibration energy in a bladed disk becomes confined to one or a few blades rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the system. This phenomenon may be explained by viewing the vibration energy of the system as a circumferentially traveling wave. In a perfectly tuned system, the wave propagates through each identical disk-blade sector, yielding uniform vibration amplitudes that differ only in phase. In the mistuned case, however, the structural irregularities may cause the traveling wave to be partially reflected at each sector. This can lead to confinement of vibration energy to a small region of the assembly. As a result, certain blades may experience forced response amplitudes and stresses that are substantially larger than those predicted by an analysis of the nominal design. Hence, certain blades may exhibit much shorter lifespans than would be predicted by a fatigue life assessment based on the nominal assembly. In order to address this concern, some efficient computational methods have been developed that can predict the effects of mistuning on the vibratory response of a turbomachinery rotor stage. Furthermore, these techniques enable analyses of large numbers of randomly mistuned bladed disks in order to estimate the mistuned forced response statistics for a rotor design. However, at the outset of this research effort, no methods possessed the combination of accuracy and computational efficiency required to allow reliable statistical assessments of mistuning sensitivity to be included {{as an integral part of}} the turbomachinery rotor design process. Motivated by the turbomachinery community's need for practical design tools that incorporate mistuning effects, three distinct objectives are identified and addressed in this research effort: 1 - To develop highly efficient and accurate reduced order modeling techniques for the free and forced response of tuned and mistuned bladed disks, based on parent finite element representations of arbitrary complexity and detail in a consistent and systematic fashion. 2 - To broaden the scope of these reduced order modeling techniques by establishing linearized formulations for shrouded blade designs. 3 - To increase the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of the mistuning phenomenon, with particular emphasis on the role of disk flexibility and structural stage-to-stage coupling in determining a design's sensitivity to mistuning, leading to formulations for multi-stage synthesis and analysis.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this PhD thesis is the {{development}} of an efficient system that can simultaneously pump and separate a gas-liquid mixture, in particular an oil-air mixture. Two-phase flows are encountered in many applications (petroleum extraction, flow in nuclear power plant pumps, pulp and paper processing, etc.) but this study is mainly focused on lubrication systems of aircraft gas turbine engines. The pump and separator system (PASS) for two-phase flows developed in this PhD thesis aims to perform three functions simultaneously: • Send back the oil to the tank (oil pumping) • Separate the air from the oil (de-aeration) • Separate the oil from the air (de-oiling) and release the sealing air into the atmosphere (venting). Particular care is given to the liquid flow rate lost at the gas outlet of the system. Consequently, it could replace the scavenge pumps and oil-air separators existing in present lubrication systems. This modification provides several advantages: simplification of the lubrication circuit, reduction of oil consumption and {{of the size of the}} lubrication system. This research is divided into three axes: the theoretical study of the important physical mechanisms taking place inside the two-phase flow pump and separator system, the experimental development, tests and optimization of different PASS prototypes, and also the numerical simulations of the two-phase flow inside these prototypes. Although the experiments were the central pillar of this research, the three axes were closely imbricated. The PASS design includes three main components: • An inlet chamber with one or several tangential inlets giving a natural centrifugation to the flow, • An impeller (forced centrifugation) with an axial and a radial part followed by a volute chamber, • A metallic foam that lets pass micron and sub-micron droplets and which is followed by an axial vent port. The centrifugation causes the liquid (oil) to move radially outwards in an annular body (a liquid ring) generating pressure. The thickness of this liquid ring inside the impeller is mainly determined by the pressure coefficient (related to the back-pressure and the rotational speed). When the back-pressure increases, the thickness of the liquid ring increases too. An advantage of the PASS is that it does not impose any relation between the liquid head and the liquid flow rate, contrary to common centrifugal pump. It self-regulates the radial position of the gas-liquid interface to sustain the operating conditions. The de-aeration efficiency mainly depends on the pressure coefficient (for a constant liquid viscosity or temperature) or on the thickness of the liquid ring. The pressure gradient which appears in the liquid rotating in an annular body acts like a dam for the gas phase. Indeed, the gas movement is mainly determined by the pressure field (buoyancy) while the liquid distribution is dominated by centrifugal and Coriolis forces. Buoyancy tends to accumulate the gas phase near low pressure areas (PASS hub, suction side of the blades, clearances between closed impeller and casing). The first oil-air PASS prototype produces high viscous losses due to the high peripheral velocity and liquid viscosity. Therefore, the pumping efficiency is poor compared to common <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps.</b> However, the pumping is not the key function of the PASS and a power consumption below 5 kW is acceptable for the application considered in this work. For applications that require lower power consumptions, a reduction of the rotational speed must be considered. Thus, the rotational speed and the impeller diameter are two major constraints for the PASS design which determine the de-aeration and pumping efficiencies. The impeller diameter also influences the size of passage sections for the air flow. The air velocity must be kept as low as possible because the entrainment of droplets increases when the air velocity rises (drag forces on droplets). Indeed, this large influence of the air flow rate on the oil consumption (de-oiling efficiency) was demonstrated by a theoretical analysis, the experiments and the CFD simulations. The production of droplets in the inlet pipes when the two-phase flow is annular is a key phenomenon regarding the oil consumption. In addition to the air flow rate, other variables also influence the oil consumption: • Air-oil temperature: when the temperature rises, the oil consumption increases because the surface tension and the oil density are reduced. Moreover, as the air density also decreases, the air velocity rises. • Oil flow rate: the oil consumption rises more or less linearly with the oil flow rate. However, the influence of the oil flow rate on the inlet droplet size is uncertain. • Rotational speed: the rotational speed has obviously a strong impact on the oil consumption without metallic foam. However, experiments showed that the metallic foam efficiency is almost independent on the rotational speed. Therefore, the oil consumption with the Retimet foam does not depend on the PASS rotational speed. • Altitude or air density: the oil consumption decreases when the air density is reduced because the drag forces on droplets also decrease. The gas density (altitude) is also supposed to influence the de-aeration efficiency but this could not be tested or simulated in this work (the de-aeration efficiency gets probably better when decreasing the gas density because the buoyancy forces increase). Theory, experiments and numerical simulations also allowed the prediction of performance of the first oil-air prototype for real in-flight operating conditions. Two problems have been identified: the de-aeration efficiency at MTO and cruise ratings and the oil leak throughout the vent in cold start and windmilling. To solve them, some modifications of the lubrication system have been suggested. With these modifications, the oil-air PASS should become very efficient and attractive for engine manufacturers.

40|$|ObjectiveIn a univentricular Fontan circulation, modest {{augmentation}} {{of existing}} cavopulmonary pressure head (2 – 5 mm Hg) would reduce systemic venous pressure, increase ventricular filling, and thus substantially improve circulatory status. An ideal means of providing mechanical cavopulmonary support does not exist. We hypothesized that a viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> {{based on the}} von Kármán viscous pump principle, is optimal for this role. MethodsA 3 -dimensional computational model of the total cavopulmonary connection was created. The impeller was represented as a smooth 2 -sided conical actuator disk with rotation in the vena caval axis. Flow was modeled under 3 conditions: (1) passive flow with no disc; (2) passive flow with a nonrotating disk, and (3) induced flow with disc rotation (0 – 5 K rpm). Flow patterns and hydraulic performance were examined for each case. Hydraulic performance for a vaned impeller was assessed by measuring pressure increase and induced flow over 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop. ResultsA nonrotating actuator disc stabilized cavopulmonary flow, reducing power loss by 88 %. Disk rotation (from baseline dynamic flow of 4. 4 L/min) resulted in a pressure increase of 0. 03 mm Hg. A further increase in pressure of 5 to 20 mm Hg and 0 to 5 L/min flow was obtained with a vaned impeller at 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop.

PULSATILE OR NONPULSATILE FLOW In the early 1980 s, people did not know whether a nonpulsatile pump could support the circulation partly or totally. Most medical doctors preferred to use pulsatile flow pumps, but the serious problems resulted in the application of diaphragm pumps forced the researchers to change the pumping principle. It followed thereafter two tendencies that some one tried to maintain the animal circulation with nonpulsatile flow as long as possible and others made efforts to develop a pulsatile rotary pump. The conflict of nonpulsatile or pulsatile perfusion lasted to the end of 1990 s. As the author published a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with low hemolysis (Artificial Organs, 1989 / 13 / 02 P 162 - 169), the nonpulsatile pump could make the animal experimental survival only few weeks.

In the following 10 years, however, nonpulsatile pump achieved long-term survival in animal experiments worldwide [1], and now a patient has lived by a nonpulsatile pump for about 7 years [2].

40|$|Abstract: It {{is evident}} that a pulsatile flow is {{important}} for blood circulation because the flow pulsatility can reduce the resistance of peripheral vessels. It is difficult, however, to produce a pulsatile flow with an <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> since blood damage will occur when a pulsatile flow is produced. Further investigation has revealed that the main factor for blood damage is turbulence shear, which tears the membranes of red blood cells, resulting in free release of haemoglobin into the plasma, and consequently lead to haemolysis. Therefore, the question for producing a pulsatile flow with low haemolysis becomes how to develop a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with less turbulence? The authors have successively developed a pulsatile axial pump and a pulsatile centrifugal pump. In the pulsatile axial <b>pump,</b> the <b>impeller</b> reciprocates axially and rotates simultaneously. The reciprocation is driven by a pneumatic device and the rotation by a DC motor. For a pressure of 40 mm Hg pulsatility, about 50 mm axially reciprocation amplitude of the impeller is desirable. In {{order to reduce the}} axial amplitude, the pump inlet and the impeller both have cone-shaped heads, thus the gap between the impeller and the inlet pipe changes by only 2 mm, that is, the impeller reciprocates up to 2 mm, a pressure pulsatility of 40 mmHg can be produced. As the impeller rotates with a constant speed, low turbulence in the pump can be expected. In the centrifugal pulsatile pump, the impelle...|$|R

This paper {{carried out}} {{composition}} test, metallurgical analysis and water samples test of work {{environment for the}} centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> material which experiences corrosion failure. Then combined with the scanning electron microscope and spectroscopy analysis of the fracture morphology, it conducted XRF analysis for the corrosion material to study the unsuccessful corrosion of MDS multistage centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>impeller</b> in coal mine well water with alkalescence. The researches show that washout of solid- liquid composite phase leads to the serious erosion of <b>pump</b> <b>impeller.</b> The turbulence corrosion and cavitation are the main reasons which cause unsuccessful corrosion of this pump, while the organization defections such as dendritic graphite and binary phosphorus eutectic are important factors {{that lead to the}} severe local corrosion of impeller. Moreover, the corresponding prevention measures are proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{a vessel}} with inner {{diameter}} 0. 29 m supplied by one, {{two or three}} impellers on a common shaft, there were measured transport characteristics (gas hold-up and volumetric mass transfer coefficient) in dependence on power consumption. As an impeller there was used the pitched blade <b>impeller</b> <b>pumping</b> the liquid either upwards or downwards. Air {{was used as a}} gas phase and 3 % solution of Sokrat 44 as a liquid phase. The solution behaves as a newton liquid with viscosity 12. 9 mPa. s. Volumetric mass transfer coefficient was measured by dynamic pressure method. Gas hold-up and kLa were presented in dependence on power consumption and on gas superficial velocity. Results are compared with the data of given impeller types obtained in low viscous solutions and with the data of other impeller types...|$|R
40|$|Oil sand {{pumps are}} widely used in the mining {{industry}} for the delivery of mixtures of abrasive solids and liquids. Because they operate under highly adverse conditions, these pumps usually experience significant wear. Consequently, equipment owners are quite often forced to invest substantially in system maintenance to avoid unscheduled downtime. In this study, an approach combining relevance vector machines (RVMs) with a sum of two exponential functions was developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of field <b>pump</b> <b>impellers.</b> To handle field vibration data, a novel feature extracting process was proposed {{to arrive at a}} feature varying with the development of damage in the <b>pump</b> <b>impellers.</b> A case study involving two field datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed method. Compared with standalone exponential fitting, the proposed RVM-based model was much better able to predict the remaining useful life of <b>pump</b> <b>impellers...</b>|$|R
