40|$|This paper {{examines}} sorting into interracial friendships at selective universities. We show significant friendship segregation, {{particularly for}} blacks. Indeed, black friendships {{are no more}} diverse in college than in high school despite the colleges blacks attend having substantially smaller black populations. We show {{that part of the}} reason for the segregation patterns is large differences in academic background coupled with students being more likely to form <b>friendships</b> <b>with</b> those of similar academic backgrounds. Within a school, stronger academic backgrounds make interracial <b>friendships</b> <b>with</b> blacks less likely and <b>friendships</b> <b>with</b> Asians more likely. These results suggest that affirmative action admission policies at selective universities which drive a wedge between the academic characteristics of different racial groups may result in increased within school segregation...|$|R
