The paper reports the {{opposite}} {{evolution in the}} trends of capital and labor shares across sectors and builds a model of structural change potentially able to replicate this evidence. The key model feature {{is the presence of}} non-unitary elasticity of substitution sectoral production functions. Differences in the degree of capital-labor substitutability across manufacturing and services are able to explain the different evolution of factor income share in the two sectors. The intuition is that as the economy grows, the fraction of capital allocated to each sector increases while the fraction of labor decreases. Different degrees of substitutability make this mechanism asymmetric between sectors with the capital labor ratio increasing more in the flexible one. Hence this sector experience a decline in the labor share...|$|E
