The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>maps</b> heavily {{rely upon}} {{a vast amount of}} data {{collected}} over time. Most of the information that comprise <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> is the culmination of satellite imagery as well as street level information.

5000|$|Early <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> had {{the same}} basic {{functionality}} as paper maps—that is, they provided a “virtual view” of roads generally outlined by the terrain encompassing the surrounding area.

25|$|Before {{the start}} of excavations, {{beginning}} in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared camera and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.|$|E
