500|$|It was {{possibly}} {{at this point}} that a shelf or <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> was inserted some way under the lid of Cuthbert's coffin, supported on three wooden bars across the width, and probably with two iron rings fixed to it for lifting it off. [...] Eardulf had decided to take the most important remains and possessions of the community with them, and whether new or old, the shelf in Cuthbert's coffin was probably loaded with the St Cuthbert Gospel, which was found there in 1104. [...] It may also have held the Lindisfarne Gospels, now also in the British Library, and other books from Lindisfarne that were, and in several cases still are, at Durham Cathedral. [...] Other bones taken by the party were those remains of St Aidan (d. 651), the founder of the community, that had not been sent to Melrose, {{and the head of the}} king and saint Oswald of Northumbria, who had converted the kingdom and encouraged the founding of Lindisfarne. [...] These and other relics were reverently packaged in cloth and labelled, as more recent relics are. [...] The community also took a stone Anglo-Saxon cross, and although they had a vehiculum of some sort, probably a cart or simple wagon, Cuthbert's coffin was carried by seven young men who had grown up in the community.|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and tonearm design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic <b>inner</b> <b>cover.</b> This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no <b>inner</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Often correspondents did not {{observe the}} two-envelope regulation, {{so there are}} {{examples}} of covers where instead of an inner and outer envelope arrangement both US and Confederate postage {{was applied to the}} prisoner's letter and where both US and Confederate markings were applied. These covers are often referred to as dual-use postage covers [...] Mail exchange between the divided states was only allowed to cross the lines at specified exchange points. Mail which was going from the North destined to points in the South passed primarily at City Point, Virginia, while most of the mail going from the South to the North passed through at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, and usually bear an Old Point Comfort postmark. [...] A prisoner's cover was usually docketed with the prisoner's name, rank, and company. The marking, [...] "Examined", {{on the face of the}} cover, usually in manuscript, indicated that the cover had been opened and examined by prison officials. Once at the exchange point, the outer envelope was removed and discarded while the <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> containing the prisoner's letter was examined by military officials and delivered. There also exist covers that were carried to transfer points by exchanged prisoners and consequently bear no confederate examiner's markings.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} a second album, titled Chicago (retroactively known as Chicago II), {{which is another}} double-LP. The album's centerpiece track is a seven-part, 13-minute suite composed by Pankow called [...] "Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon". The suite yielded two top ten hits: [...] "Make Me Smile" [...] (No.9 U.S.) and [...] "Colour My World", both sung by Kath. Among the other tracks on the album: Lamm's dynamic but cryptic [...] "25 or 6 to 4" [...] (Chicago's first Top 5 hit), which is {{a reference to a}} songwriter trying to write at 25 or 26 minutes before 4 o'clock in the morning, and was sung by Cetera with [...] Terry Kath on guitar; the lengthy war-protest song [...] "It Better End Soon"; and, at the end, Cetera's 1969 moon landing-inspired [...] "Where Do We Go from Here?" [...] The double-LP album's <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> includes the playlist, the entire lyrics to [...] "It Better End Soon", and two declarations: [...] "This endeavor should be experienced sequentially", and, [...] "With this album, we dedicate ourselves, our futures and our energies {{to the people of the}} revolution. And the revolution in all of its forms." [...] The album was a commercial success, rising to number four on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1970, and platinum in 1991. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards as a result of this album, Album of the Year, and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} transfer {{points for}} mail arriving from or destined to Europe and other locations were Nassau in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba. Ships carrying letters that were addressed to {{points in the}} Confederacy would deposit their cargo of mail {{at one of these}} transfer points. Here the inbound mail was handled by a forwarding agent who would remove the mail or <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> and prepare it for transfer on a blockade runner. [...] Often the forwarding agents would apply their own markings to the cover of mail. Mail placed aboard a blockade runner would then, perhaps with some luck, make its way to the ports of New Orleans, Charleston or Wilmington, where it was received by Confederate postal operators who would then include it in with the regular Confederate mail for delivery. [...] The captain of the blockade runner would typically get two cents for every letter he delivered to port, which was a nominal sum, as his main source of revenue was from delivering his cargo. The average number of successful runs by a blockade runner was only about four, many of them meeting a fateful ending on their first run. Various ports along the coastline of the Confederacy saw the most traffic from blockade runners. Charleston in South Carolina was particularly well situated as a port for blockade runners with their shallow drafts, as was the Port in Wilmington in North Carolina which saw the most traffic. Because the lower Mississippi River was being blockaded effectively dividing the Western Confederate states from those east, New Orleans became one of the busiest of ports. Consequently, many blockade covers have postmarks from these locations.|$|E

50|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> {{provides}} a barrier between the telescoping cover and the bees. In more temperate climates, a plastic foil {{may be used}} as an <b>inner</b> <b>cover.</b> Plastic foil should not be used to winter bees under, as trapped condensation would cause the hive to become wet, and bees can be lost due to freezing when temperatures fall during the night. In areas with a hot summer, a solid <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> with a communication hole provides dead-air space for insulation against both heat and cold. This prevents the bees from gluing the top cover to the top bars of the super under it. When an <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> is used, the top cover is more easily removed from the hive. Notches in the frame of the solid <b>inner</b> <b>cover</b> and telescoping cover can serve as an upper entrance for the bees. A communication hole in the middle allows bees to reach emergency food placed above by the beekeeper if it becomes required.|$|E
