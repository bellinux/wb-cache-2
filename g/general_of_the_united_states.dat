5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial.

5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, {{when they learned}} of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E

5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declined}} to rehear the case, the Capobiancos filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. Seven entities filed amici curiae briefs with the Supreme Court {{in support of}} hearing the case. This included amici briefs by two former Solicitors <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of the birth mother, suggesting that the Equal Protection Clause requires applying strict scrutiny to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted briefs.|$|E
5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and Governor Foraker {{suggested}} President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and {{his professional}} goal {{was always a}} seat on the Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it. Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate the backlog, while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} {{president}} in November 1980, Scalia hoped for a major position in the new administration. He was interviewed for the position of Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> but the position went to Rex E. Lee, to Scalia's great disappointment. Scalia was offered {{a seat on the}} Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in early 1982 but declined it, hoping to be appointed to the highly influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). Later that year, Reagan offered Scalia a seat on the D.C. Circuit, which Scalia accepted. He was confirmed by the US Senate on August 5, 1982, and was sworn in on August 17, 1982.|$|E
