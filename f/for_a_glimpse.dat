5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
5|$|The {{homecoming}} celebration {{went on for}} days. Officials and {{the general}} population of the island crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch. Speeches were made in both English and Hawaiian, and some people stood on rooftops <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse.</b> Floral arrangements permeated the city, welcome-home signs were displayed, and music was everywhere. Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened for the public to personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the Poola Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{hundreds}} of thousands of people who turned out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the horse over his career was Dwight Eisenhower, who lined up with his parents at the 1904 Kansas State Fair. Harry Truman recalled that as a boy he had written a fan letter to the horse.|$|E

25|$|Hanks is {{perceived}} to be amiable and congenial to his fans. In 2013, when he was starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy on Broadway, he had crowds of 300 fans waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of him after every performance. This is the highest number of expectant fans post-show of any Broadway performance.|$|E
25|$|For most herds, milking {{took place}} indoors twice a day, in a barn with the cattle tied {{by the neck}} with ropes or {{held in place by}} stanchions. Feeding could occur {{simultaneously}} with milking in the barn, although most dairy cattle were pastured during the day between milkings. Such examples of this method of dairy farming are difficult to locate, but some are preserved as a historic site <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> into the days gone by. One such instance that is open for this is at Point Reyes National Seashore.|$|E
25|$|Niagara Falls {{have long}} {{been a source of}} {{inspiration}} for explorers, travelers, artists, authors, filmmakers, residents and visitors, few of whom realize the falls were nearly devoted solely to industrial and commercial use. In the 1870s, sightseers had limited access to Niagara Falls and often had to pay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse,</b> and industrialization threatened to carve up Goat Island to further expand commercial development. Other industrial encroachments and lack of public access led to a conservation movement in the U.S. known as Free Niagara, led by such notables as Hudson River School artist Frederic Edwin Church, landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Church approached Lord Dufferin, governor-general of Canada, with a proposal for international discussions on the establishment of a public park.|$|E

As he traveled by rail to Lincoln, he saw farmers and others standing by the tracks, hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the new Democratic nominee. He received many letters from supporters, expressing their faith in him in stark terms. One Indiana voter wrote, [...] "God has sent you amongst our people to save the poor from starvation, and we no [...] you will save us."

[...] He concludes his review with the recommendation, [...] "Give yourself a treat and find your own copies of Planet P and Pink World <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of a time long gone by and great music that may never return." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{at school}} in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, David Marr, wrote that [...] "the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of their {{favourite}} stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents {{if he could}} leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that {{his work as a}} jackaroo would temper his artistic ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|A celebrity supercouple {{to emerge}} after Bennifer was [...] "TomKat" [...] (the {{coupling}} of celebrity stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes), {{and other countries}} had already adopted the supercouple term. The United Kingdom had Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley (Grant 'n' Hurley) and Posh and Becks (Victoria and David Beckham). Japan had Tomonori Jinnai and Norika Fujiwara; Jinnai {{established himself as a}} television regular and a [...] "pin-geinin" [...] or solo comedian while Fujiwara, a former Miss Japan, became known as a successful actress and [...] "one of the business's biggest earners with a string of commercial contracts, regular TV and stage roles, and also active in charitable causes". They were titled [...] "one of the 'super couples' of Japanese showbiz" [...] and [...] "held their elaborate traditional wedding on February 17, 2007 at the Ikutajinja shrine in Fujiwara's hometown of Kobe, with hundreds of reporters and thousands of fans craning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> outside" [...] and [...] "invited 600 guests to the Hotel Okura the following April for a wedding reception that cost over ¥500 million.

2500|$|In December 1905, after {{returning}} to Washington from their diplomatic travels, Alice became engaged to Nicholas Longworth III, a Republican U.S. House of Representatives member from Cincinnati, Ohio, who ultimately would rise to become Speaker of the House. The two had travelled in the same social circles for several years, but their relationship solidified during the Imperial Cruise. A scion of a socially prominent Ohio family, Longworth was 14 years her senior and {{had a reputation as}} a Washington D.C. playboy. Their wedding took place in February 1906 and was the social event of the season. It was attended by more than a thousand guests with many thousands gathered outside hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the bride. She was dressed in a blue wedding dress and dramatically cut the wedding cake with a sword (borrowed from a military aide attending the reception). Immediately after the wedding, the couple left for a honeymoon that included a voyage to Cuba and a visit to the Longworths in Cincinnati. This was followed by travels to England and the Continent which included having dinners with many notables of the day: King Edward, Kaiser Wilhelm, Clemenceau, Whitelaw Reid, Lord Curzon, and William Jennings Bryan. [...] They bought a house at 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C., now the headquarters of the Washington Legal Foundation.|$|E
