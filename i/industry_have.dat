5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex <b>{{industry}}</b> <b>have</b> been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe parametrically {{estimate}} total-factor {{energy efficiency}} (TFEE) scores for 10 industries in 14 developed countries {{for the period}} 1995 - 2005 using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique. The model includes four inputs (labor, capital stock, energy, and non-energy intermediate inputs) and one output (value added). Unlike previous studies that use data envelopment analysis (DEA), our method can take into account statistical noises. The results show that More {{than half of the}} <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> insignificant changes in the inefficiency trend. However, construction, paper, and textile <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> significantly increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency). The metal industry is the only <b>industry</b> which <b>has</b> decreasing inefficiency (increasing efficiency). As a result, most of the OECD <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> much room in improving their total-factor energy efficiency.

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities of consumers for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising <b>industry</b> <b>have</b> expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E

5000|$|Tom Randall, a {{correspondent}} specializing in renewable energy for Bloomberg, calls to attention that {{wind and solar}} (energy sources) are [...] "outperforming" [...] fossil fuels. In terms of investments, clean energy outperforms both gas and coal by a 2-1 margin. This positive margin {{may be attributed to}} the consistently falling price of renewable energy production. Renewable energy sources hold assertive advantages over fossil fuels because they exist as technologies, not fuels. As time proceeds, renewable energy becomes inevitably more efficient as technology adapts. Technologies for extracting fuels may change, but the fuels remain as constants. Both the solar and wind <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> proven growth over time: Over the last 15 years, the solar <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> doubled seven times and the wind <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> doubled four times. In contrast, the fossil fuel <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> declined over the last 15 years. America's coal <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> lost 75 percent of its value within the past few years.|$|R

The evidence suggests that these two <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> clusters that experience very different firm performance gains and losses in comparison to other non-clustered firms in their industries.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Swedish computer and video game industry. The main focus is on the Swedish game development industry. Little research on the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> been done and the purpose is to define the companies involved and to create an initial overview of {{the development of the}} industry. This overview will later be used as a platform for the doctorial thesis. Games are a growing culture form and today {{a lot of people are}} playing different types of computer and video games. Internationally the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> expanded and some of the successful games have generated spectacular revenues. In Sweden the <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> received attention from different actors like universities, government bodies and media. There are today educations that are focused on game development and there are programs which allocates grants towards game companies. The rapid development in the computers technology has had a great impact on the game industry, which is dependent on hardware development to create games. The first computer games were made for some of the very first computers in the 1940 ´s and 1950 ´s. In the 1970 ´s a market for games was created when arcade machines and somewhat later home consoles were introduced. The <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> grown and includes today some of the largest companies in the world. The Swedish industry follows the international pattern but developed a bit later and the first Swedish game companies were founded in the late 1980 ´s. The <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> expanded, especially between 1998 and 2002. In 2005 the number of people employed in the <b>industry</b> <b>had</b> increased to over 600.
