This is more common on auroral and EME channels than on HF, but it can occur. A short coherence time limits the symbol time, or more precisely, the maximum coherent detection interval at the receiver. If the symbol energy is too small for an adequate per-symbol detection SNR, then one alternative is transmit a symbol longer than the coherence time but to detect it with a filter muchwider than one matched to the transmitted symbol. (The filter should instead be matched to the tone spectrum expected at the receiver). This will capture much of the symbol energy despite <b>Doppler</b> <b>spreading,</b> but it will necessarily do so inefficiently. A wider tone spacing, i.e., a wider channel, is also required. Forward error correction is especially helpful in this case.|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} systems have experienced phenomenal {{growth over the}} last three decades. Tremendous research efforts have been devoted, andmany important developments have been made. Future wireless {{communication systems}} aim at providing reliable data transmission even under high mobility scenarios. One of the challenging issues is the large <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread,</b> which is caused by the high mobility of a wireless terminal and may lead to severe communication performance loss. <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> is a measure of spectral broadening of the rate of change in a mobile fading channel which is proportional to the mobile speed. As <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> is a significant parameter of themobile channel, it is important to a number ofwirelessmobile applicationswhich require the knowledge of the fading rate of channel variations or the mobile speed. Therefore, the large <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> in high mobility wireless communication systems cannot be negligible anymore and an accurate estimate of <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> is imperative to develop future mobile communication systems for high speed vehicles. The objective of this thesis is to design effective algorithms for <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation in high mobility wireless communication scenarios. Many approaches have been proposed forDoppler spread estimation. The optimal <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation is based on the maximum likelihood principle, which usually involves exorbitant complexity. Other <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation approaches, such as the level crossing rate based approach and the covariance based approach, are with low complexity, but they need a large number of observations and their performance degradation exists in either low <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> range or high <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> range. As the knowledge of <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> can be used to characterise the time variation of fading channels, it can be employed to enhance channel estimation performance. Many <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation approaches are based on the channel estimates, while the channel coefficients are assumed to be known at the receiver. The mutual dependence of channel estimation and <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation motivates joint <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> and channel estimation in order to achieve better performance. We propose a new joint <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> and channel estimation approach for Rayleigh fading channels through an iterative process between a <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimator and a channel estimator. The proposed <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimator is based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the estimated channel coefficients, where we devise an ACF lag selection mechanism to maximise the performance of <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation. We use a Forney-style factor graph to represent the fading channel with a first order autoregressive (AR(1)) model and implement a Gaussian message passing (GMP) based channel estimator for <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> estimation, where the AR(1) model coefficients are optimised. Compared to existing joint <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> and channel estimation approaches, the proposed approach achieves similar or better performance with lower complexity. We also propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based time-varying channel estimation approach. It has been shown that the EMalgorithmmay be viewed as message passing in factor graphs, and for a linear Gaussian system with unknown parameters, the EM algorithm may be implemented by the GMP techniques. With a Forney-style factor graph representation of the fading channel approximated by an AR(1) model, we devise a low-complexity EM-GMP based approach to joint estimate the channel coefficients and the AR(1) model coefficients, where theDoppler spread can be extracted fromthe estimatedAR(1) model coefficients. The proposed EM-GMP based approach has similar complexity per iteration as the conventional EMbased approach, but it significantly outperforms the conventional EM based approach in terms of convergence rate, especially in low <b>Doppler</b> <b>spread</b> range...|$|E

The characterization of the tunnel environment is crucial for deploying vehicular communication systems. In this paper we evaluate vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) radio channel measurements inside a tunnel.

The temporal evolution of the stationarity time is highly influenced by the strength of time-varying multipath components and the distance between vehicles.

This Ionospheric Scintillation and TEC Monitor (GISTM) receiver is able to measure amplitude and phase scintillation, and also Total Electron Content (TEC). In addition, a High Frequency (HF) link has been established from Qaanaaq to Svalbard since March 2009 to study the channel characteristics, including <b>Doppler</b> <b>spreads.</b> This study covers from end of May 2008 to February 2011 where it was mostly during the minimum state of solar activity. During the period of where both GISTM and HF data were available (i. e.

Winter months expectedly show lower mean vertical TEC (VTEC) than in other months. Higher mean VTEC was observed in 2010 that {{could be related to}} the increase of solar activity. In 2010, both small and large patches of moderate-high intensity were found to be more than twice as common in February and March than in other months. The difference in the occurrences of small patches between months of the same year was about 1 - 2 % (for low intensity patches) and 1 - 10 % (moderate-high intensity). This difference increased to 1 - 4 % (low intensity) and 1 - 12 % (moderate-high intensity) for large patches. UT dependence can be seen where ~ 80 large and ~ 300 small patches were identified ~ 1000 to 2000 UT from June to October in both 2008 and 2009, and they doubled in 2010. Amplitude scintillations index, S 4 were very low where at least ~ 99 % were between 0 and 0. 1, which is insignificant. Meanwhile, phase scintillations index, σφ were from 0 to 0. 1 rad for at least 93 % of the time. The relationship of TEC fluctuations/increase and phase scintillations is complex. There are few events where phase scintillations occurred simultaneously with slant TEC increases, but this is not frequent. The magnitude of the irregularities was generally independent of geomagnetic indices, Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) components, and local magnetic fields at Eureka and Resolute Bay. Monthly upper decile of <b>Doppler</b> <b>spreads</b> generally varied from 1 to 5. 5 Hz. High upper decile normally occurred from around September/October to March, from ~ 0000 to 1700 UT on 6. 95 and 8. 01 MHz.

Upper decile on these frequencies was mostly 0. 5 - 4. 5 Hz larger in October 2010 -February 2011 than in the same months of the previous year which possibly related to the increase in solar activity. However, <b>Doppler</b> <b>spreads</b> were generally independent of independent of geomagnetic indices, IMF components, and local magnetic fields.
