5|$|Naylor writes {{books for}} children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor {{typically}} takes {{several years to}} finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and character traits when she thinks of them. She considered Shiloh to be a deviation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|Some temples, in a {{departure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> were dedicated to deities other than Shiva or Vishnu. These include the Surya (portrayed as 'Suryanarayana') shrine at the Kasi Vishveshwara temple complex and a Jain temple dedicated to Mahavira, both at Lakkundi; the Taradevi temple (built in a Buddhist architectural style) at Dambal in the Gadag district; the Mahamaya temple {{dedicated to a}} tantric goddess at Kuknur in the Koppal district, and the Durga temple at Hirekerur in the Haveri district.|$|E

50|$|With {{regard to}} Beethoven's late work, and {{especially}} to his late piano sonatas, Op. 109 is particularly noteworthy for its divergence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norms</b> of sonata form and for its harmonic and structural innovations.|$|R
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The library {{block is}} {{predominantly}} clad in glass, fitted with horizontal fins, on its frontage {{with the main}} road. The alfresco café had a street frontage and was spread into the shared forecourt. The roof of the community building resembles the leaves of a palm tree, and covers the community club's rooftop basketball court. The court's location on the roof level was a departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> as in other community centres then, the basketball court occupies space on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Henstridge portrays Simmons, and {{is joined}} by guest star Dillon Casey as another {{survivor}} stranded on the planet. Series regulars Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, and Iain De Caestecker also briefly appear. The episode was a departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for the series, focusing on a single character rather than the usual ensemble, and taking place on an alien planet. The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used {{to make it appear}} to be night on the planet, as its sun rarely rises. The episode took inspiration from multiple science fiction films, and bears similarity to The Martian, which was released close to the episode's airing.|$|E

5000|$|Szasz {{argued that}} psychiatrics {{were created in}} the 17th century to study and control those who erred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>norms</b> of social behavior; a new specialization, drogophobia, {{was created in the}} 20th century to study and control those who erred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>norms</b> of drug consumption; and then, in the 1960s, another specialization, bariatrics, was created to deal with those who erred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> medical <b>norms</b> {{concerning}} <b>the</b> weight the body should have. Thus, he underscores that in 1970, the American Society of Bariatic Physicians (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> Greek baros, for [...] "weight") had 30 members, and already 450 two years later.|$|R
50|$|Durkheim's {{examples}} of social facts included social {{institutions such as}} kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions {{with other members of}} our societies.

25|$|A useful {{property}} of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data. There are also other measures of deviation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm,</b> including average absolute deviation, which provide different mathematical properties from standard deviation.|$|E
25|$|Washington D.C.'s The Faith took {{hardcore}} punk to {{new places}} in the early 1980s. Even during their existence, their music hinted at what was to come, softening the standard-issue hardcore approach somewhat with better-developed melodies and a more inward-looking perspective. To be sure, it was high-energy, high-velocity punk, but its subtle deviations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> opened up new vistas for the D.C. scene.|$|E
25|$|In a {{departure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> {{the final report}} was published and made publicly available.

25|$|Analyzing {{the number}} of dead by using census data to {{calculate}} the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war. This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.|$|E
25|$|Normally, sainthood causes {{take many}} years to {{progress}} to canonization; the exceptions to these cases (causes of martyrs, who only need one miracle for sainthood; or where the Pope has granted a waiver to start the process sooner after death) are quite apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> Nevertheless, {{the potential for a}} long delay was very frustrating to many in the area and beyond who had helped and funded his cause, and to his other supporters.|$|E

25|$|The station {{buildings}} {{along the}} Sørlandet Line were mostly standardized designs. Marnardal followed late {{in a rather}} standardized period of Neoclassical architecture used by the Norwegian State Railways since the 1920s. By the 1940s the designs had been altered to include elements of functionalism. It has siding of weatherboard and was built with two stories, providing an upper story for a station master's residence. The design was altered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> by having the two-storey section built normally to the single-storey section. A similar design was chosen at Snartemo Station.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the publication and distribution of Christian literature and Bibles, the Protestant missionary movement in China furthered the dispersion of knowledge with other printed works of history and science. As the missionaries went to work among the Chinese, they established and developed schools and introduced medical techniques from the West. The mission schools were viewed with some suspicion by the traditional Chinese teachers, but they differed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> by offering a basic education to poor Chinese, both boys and girls, who had no hope of learning at a school before {{the days of the}} Chinese Republic.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{for outdoor}} sports {{facilities}} and ice rinks {{often have to}} deal with substantial echo, which can make speech unintelligible. Sports and recreational sound systems often face environmental challenges as well, such as the need for weather-proof outdoor speakers in outdoor stadiums and humidity- and splash-resistant speakers in swimming pools. Another challenge with sports sound reinforcement setups is that in many arenas and stadiums, the spectators are on all four sides of the playing field. This requires 360 degree sound coverage. This is very different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> with music festivals and music halls, where the musicians are on stage and the audience is seated in front of the stage.|$|E

50|$|In theology, {{the term}} {{is often used to}} {{distinguish}} marvels or deceptive trickery, often attributed to witchcraft or demons, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> purely divine power of the genuinely supernatural to violate the laws of nature.

Therefore, her theory relates to deviation IQ, though the subjects of her study were more technically measured using a ratio IQ scale.|$|R
