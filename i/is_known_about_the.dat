5|$|A strong squall {{swept across}} Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, {{and at least}} one other vessel {{suffered}} structural damage.

Janetti stated that the series has not yet been greenlit by Fox.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} bodies of {{irregular}} shape. Their geometric albedos generally vary between 3 and 10%. The average value is 0.056±0.003 for the objects larger than 57km, and 0.121±0.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25km. The asteroid 4709 Ennomos {{has the highest}} albedo (0.18) of all known Jupiter trojans. Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> masses, chemical composition, rotation or other physical properties of the Jupiter trojans.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs are {{not known}} in the fossil record on Madagascar until the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Consequently, little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{evolution}} of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur clade, which comprises the endemic primate population of the island.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{below its}} lambda point (called heliumII) {{exhibits}} very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when it boils, {{it does not}} bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> properties of the isotope.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Marquesan Dog. They were {{introduced}} to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point.|$|E

5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{behaviour}} of the Cuban macaw and its extinct Caribbean relatives. Gundlach {{reported that}} it vocalised loudly like its Central American relatives and that it lived in pairs or families. Its speech imitation abilities were reportedly inferior {{to those of other}} parrots. Nothing is known about its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species {{is more likely}} to be found inland than in the coastal regions.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the cinema from its initial years to the 1980s. In 1959, to promote the showing of The Big Hunt, a live {{elephant}} appeared outside the cinema.

5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the oldest exposed rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later exposed these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of A.viridimontanum in the ecosystem. In general, ferns {{are less}} {{susceptible}} to herbivory than flowering plants due {{to higher levels of}} toxic and distasteful compounds in their foliage. A.viridimontanum is not known to be threatened by a particular predator or disease.|$|E
5|$|Somari was {{developed}} by the homebrew developer Hummer Team. Very little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game's origins; it is theorized to have been based upon extracted source code from the original game and its sequel that was back-ported to the NES.

5|$|Triton's south {{polar region}} is covered by a highly {{reflective}} cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers.

5|$|Very little <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds {{because they are}} used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
