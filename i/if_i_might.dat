I can see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{that for}} some time many persons {{have had to do}} with the art [...] who have greatly lowered it... the desire came upon me to try <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> imitate, after some fashion, some one among those who honourably busied {{themselves}} with the art, [...] I hear regretted every day ... and inasmuch as I could not accomplish this design for lack of types which I needed... would not, and others could not furnish me with what I lacked [...] I resolved, about six years ago, to turn my hand in good earnest to the making of punches, matrices and moulds for all sorts of characters, for the accommodation both of the public and of myself.|$|E
500|$|Lo co-wrote [...] "Love Me Like You Do", {{recorded}} by English singer Ellie Goulding, which was released {{as the second}} single from the [...] to the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015). The track topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, Lo received nominations, alongside the others co-writers of the song, for the Golden Globes, Grammys and Critics' Choice Awards. [...] Discussing {{the process of writing}} for other artists, the singer told Paste that she avoids drawing from her own experiences so that the songs do not become personal. She also stated: [...] "My main goal is to say something how they would say it, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say it in a different way that makes more sense to me".|$|E

Yes! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> hadn't, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have married him, and perhaps <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had died soon <b>I</b> <b>might</b> never have found him out. He {{could have been}} good to me a year or two, and then, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> died, I should have been safe. Yes, I wish he could have deceived me till after we were married. Then I couldn't have borne to give him up, may be." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sheraton Kalouria, NBC's Vice President of Daytime Programming, said he {{believes}} in the [...] "it" [...] factor regarding fictional couples. [...] "It's hard to imagine Bo and Hope as a supercouple and divorce that from the magnetic chemistry of Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso," [...] he stated. [...] "Or Cruz and Eden from Santa Barbara days and A Martinez and Marcy Walker. Or McKenzie Westmore as Sheridan and Galen Gering as Luis, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be so bold as to dub them a supercouple. Actors bring a huge excitement to [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "With full {{affection for}} the flag which I have been born under, and the flag I represent, I can {{understand}} the sentiment and feeling of a republican who has created his independence, and values that before all; but I can say fairly that I believe {{in the future that}} I can assimilate the system, which I have been connected with, with the Cape Colony, and it is not an impossible idea that the neighbouring republics, retaining their independence, should share with us as to certain general principles. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> put it to you, I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arguably {{still playing}} {{as well as}} he ever had, Hines {{displayed}} individualistic quirks (including grunts) in these performances. He sometimes sang as he played, especially his own [...] "They Didn't Believe I Could Do It ... Neither Did I". In 1975, Hines was the subject of an hour-long television documentary film made by ATV (for Britain's commercial ITV channel), out-of-hours at the Blues Alley nightclub in Washington, DC. The International Herald Tribune described it as [...] "the greatest jazz film ever made". In the film, Hines said, [...] "The way I like to play is that ... I'm an explorer, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> use that expression, I'm looking for something all the time ... almost like I'm trying to talk." [...] He played solo at Duke Ellington's funeral, played solo twice at the White House, for the President of France and for the Pope. Of this acclaim, Hines said, [...] "Usually they give people credit when they're dead. I got my flowers while I was living".|$|E
6000|$|James Morris gave a sigh. [...] "Honestly, White Buffalo, <b>I</b> cannot. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> could <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{solve the}} whole of this vexing question, and then, perhaps, we'd have no war. But it doesn't seem right for the whites and the Indians to be {{fighting}} all the time. It hurts one {{just as much as}} it hurts the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I am. I {{think that}} it is better that I should go away now. There are reasons why I do not want to talk about Lord Arranmore, or discuss this matter with you, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> stayed <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do both. Will you dine with me somewhere on Friday night? I will come and fetch you." ...|$|R

2500|$|As the French advanced, the English {{launched}} their charge. Stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces {{right into the}} French line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. Fearful of encirclement, the cohesion of the French army disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel√©e. Around this time, King John and his son, Philip the Bold, found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> see him, I would speak with him". Denis replied; [...] "Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; [...] "I yield me to you".|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mean {{to have it}} arranged, you had better look to it. I am {{speaking}} in earnest, Rufford. I {{am not going to}} give up authorities. Indeed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did <b>I</b> <b>might</b> give up everybody. The very servants suppose that they know it, and there isn't a groom or horseboy about who isn't in his heart congratulating the young lady on her promotion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} I was sinking {{slowly to the}} pavement, {{in a state of}} acute reflection. So long as the ruffians were with me, I dared not quit the role of drunkard.

"It may be I've missed Cuba," [...] he thought; [...] "but I can {{not change}} my course now, for <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did <b>I</b> <b>might</b> get lost, and {{never be able to}} find land again. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> keep on as I am I shall be sure to reach land of some sort, in time, and when I wish to return home I can set the {{indicator}} to the northwest and that will take me directly back to Boston." ...|$|R

'Oh, no!' exclaimed Sophy; 'I {{often feel}} {{so sick of}} lying here, that <b>I</b> feel as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never could be sulky <b>if</b> only <b>I</b> <b>might</b> walk about, and go from one room to another when I please!

60|$|Tibbie, Davit's wife, was {{sister to}} Marget, Pete's widow, and she {{generally}} did visit Jess on Saturday night {{to talk about}} Marget, who was fast {{becoming one of the}} most fashionable persons in Thrums. Tibbie was hopelessly plebeian. She was none of your proud kind, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> entered the kitchen when she was there she pretended not to see me, so that, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> chose, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> escape without speaking to the like of her.
