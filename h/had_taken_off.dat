5|$|The Mk VIII {{was also}} {{discussed}} {{in terms of}} another plan known as the Carrier Wing; in this plan flying surfaces, such as wings, would be fitted to the Mk VIII so that it could be towed by a transport aircraft and then glide into battle in support of airborne forces. The plan was dropped, however, after the prototype crashed after it <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1946 Geoffrey de Havilland Jr {{was killed}} test-flying the DH.108 Swallow over the Thames estuary. Cunningham <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> {{at the same}} time to deliver the first Vampire in Switzerland. Cunningham only learned the next morning, from Swiss {{newspapers}} at breakfast in Geneva, that de Havilland was missing. Cunningham knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John had been killed in a collision while flying a Mosquito in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> before them had caused the crash.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|E
5|$|For their {{action on}} December 7, the U.S. War Department in Communiqué No. 19 on December 13, 1941, {{designated}} Taylor and Welch {{as the first}} two American heroes of World War II, and awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross on January 8, 1942. Taylor learned {{that he was to}} receive the award in mid-December after reading several newspapers. The award is the United States Army's second highest honor for valor in the heat of combat. Additionally, he later received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, and a Purple Heart for injuries he sustained. Both men were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but were turned down because they <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> without orders.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was in his}} Senate offices {{meeting with}} First Lady Laura Bush when the September 11, 2001, attacks took place. Two of the {{airplanes}} involved <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> from Boston, and in the following weeks, Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks. He pushed through legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his {{former chief of staff}} Kenneth Feinberg as Special Master of the government's September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January, one of {{the most}} unusual aerial battles of the Vietnam War took place. Two Soviet-built An-2 Colt biplanes of the North Vietnamese Air Force {{attacked}} Lima Site 85 atop a craggy peak known as Phou Pha Thi. An Air America Bell 205 helicopter, which <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> to avoid air-dropped 120mm mortar rounds, then began chasing {{one of the}} Colts which had already been struck by ground fire. The aircraft crashed while making evasive maneuvers. The Bell then went after the other Colt, and the helicopter's crew chief fired an AK-47 through a sliding window, shooting the biplane down.|$|E
5|$|Antonov {{subsequently}} {{converted the}} static-test prototype into a flying prototype {{equipped with a}} modified flight-control system. The second airframe was rolled out in December 1996 in Kiev, before making its first flight on 24 April 1997 from Svyatoshino Airfield, during which the aircraft was airborne for 31 minutes; according to Jane's, however, the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> from Gostomel for a 26-minute flight. By this time, more than US$2.5 billion had been spent on the programme, with a further $200 million to be spent to prepare the aircraft for production, which was expected to have started in 1999 with 20–25 aircraft produced annually. The Russian and Ukrainian Air Forces reportedly had long-term plans to procure 500 and 100 aircraft, respectively. The second airframe was severely damaged during cold weather testing on 27 January 2001 in a crash landing after take-off.|$|E

5|$|Braham {{was summoned}} to see Basil Embry. The {{commanding}} officer made Braham wait until he had cleaned himself up and was properly dressed. Embry gave Braham a stern rebuke for risking himself in such a fashion. He had not given his agreement to the operation and Braham <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> before he could give a definitive answer. Nevertheless, his 29th victory eased the tension and Embry invited him to the bar for a conciliatory beer. Bill Gregory did not fly with Bob Braham again. His DFC and bar with DFM reflected his contribution to Braham's success. He may also have taken the events of 12 May 1944 as a warning. For Braham, the thrill of ranger operations was addictive. On 25 May 1944 he attempted another but turned back because of poor weather. His last operations were flown with both Embry and Walsh on 6 June 1944 during the Normandy landings. The Western Front, dormant since 1940, was now re-activated. Braham flew over Normandy several times with Mosquito bomber groups in June 1944. These counted as his last successful operations.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off.</b> Most {{of the damage}} was done to residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed and}} 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only slight damage was done to rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 15 April, he flew {{his final}} sortie with 65 Squadron flying support for 266 Squadron and 402 Squadron. On {{the way back}} in the afternoon he claimed one Bf 109 destroyed. This, his fifth victory, made him an official fighter ace. However, according to other accounts, only two Bf 109s were involved in the brief air battle. Finucane's and 65's likely opponents in the battle was Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Jagdgeschwader 26 and future General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighter Forces). Galland <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> with his wingman and a crate containing lobster loaded into the fuselage of his Bf 109 to deliver to Jagdfliegerführer 2 Theo Osterkamp for his birthday at Luftflotte 2 headquarters. En route, Galland took a detour over the English coast and attacked several flights of Spitfires, claiming two 266 squadrons shot down. Galland's landing-gear fell down during the battle, possibly leading Finucane to claim it as destroyed. Both German pilots returned to France, their machines undamaged. Finucane was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 25 April.|$|E

5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
