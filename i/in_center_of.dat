25|$|The {{water or}} {{retardant}} is carried in three center-line belly tanks. The tanks have internal baffles to prevent fluid shift (and consequent shift <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity) while in flight, and sit with a 15-inch (38cm) ground clearance. All three tanks can be filled simultaneously {{on the ground}} in eight minutes. The retardant is gravity-fed out of the tanks, and the entire load can be dumped in eight seconds, although the actual drop rate is computer controlled by the flight crew in order to produce the desired retardant spread over the fire lines. The aircraft is capable of applying a line of retardant 300ft (91m) wide by 1 mile (1.6km) long.|$|E

The dispersant application system developed for the De Havilland of Canada DHC-6/300 Twin Otter aircraft consisted of two [...] aluminumfive- chamber tanks for dispersant. The uniqueness of the system on board the aircraft, as it was developed by the operator NFK and Widerøe's engineering department, was primarily that it was self-contained and propelled by bleed air tapped from one of the two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines on the aircraft, pressurizing the tanks. The arrangement of the tanks gave no change <b>in</b> <b>Center</b> <b>of</b> Gravity during discharge of the dispersant.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{legislation}} was still pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer wrote to Charles Moore, {{chairman of the}} Commission of Fine Arts, regarding the bill. [...] Moore replied on February 2, explaining his view that {{the best course of}} action would be to hire one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin, and then subject the result to the friendly criticism of other artists. [...] Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a [...] "prairie-schooner... second, the heads of [...] Boone and [...] Benton; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward". The hired sculptor could, Moore suggested, choose among these, as to which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a [...] "standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures [...] "24" [...] <b>in</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory." [...] Montgomery also proposed that a star with the number [...] "24" [...] (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck. [...] These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, a total of $1,750. Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words [...] "MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921" [...] appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the influence of access to potable water and sewer services about the attention for acute diarrheal disease (ADD) <b>in</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> Ministry of Health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ecological study. The geographical unit of analysis was constituted by each of 25 regions of Peru. Information was obtained of the number of attentions reported <b>of</b> ADD <b>in</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> Ministry of Health of each region for 2007. The information of population and the access to potable water and sewer services was obtained of 2007 population census. The attention rate by ADD was calculated <b>in</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> Ministry of Health being registered in a multiple linear regression model with variables of access to potable water and sewer services. RESULTS: In the total population, the percentage of housing that {{do not have access to}} potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of housing that have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of housing that have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of housing that do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0. 408). In population under 5 years old, the percentage of housing that do not have access to potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of housing that have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of housing that have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of housing that do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) also constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0, 251).
