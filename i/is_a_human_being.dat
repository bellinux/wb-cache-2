25|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional dictionaries, which {{are designed to}} be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary {{does not need to be}} able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.|$|E

The aria, as the first one, is not a da capo aria, but in two parts. The idea of man in a sinful condition which is presented first, is changed to redemption. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann relates the choice of the oboe d'amore to the answer to the singer's question [...] "Why do you do all this for man?": [...] "Aus Liebe" [...] (through love).|$|E

500|$|It must be emphasized, however, that {{an entity}} {{is not merely}} a sum of its relations, but also a {{valuation}} of them and reaction to them. [...] For Whitehead, creativity is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> a tree, or an electron) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws. [...] Of course, most entities do not have consciousness. [...] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, {{the same can be said}} of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. [...] Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.|$|E

2500|$|These {{laws have}} been {{recorded}} in the media being put into play in Uppsala: the district court punished {{a man with a}} monetary fine and probation for possession of manga-style images. This was appealed and taken to the Court of Appeal. In court, Judge [...] stated that a [...] "person" [...] (as in the definition of a [...] "child") <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> The man possessing the illustrations, as well as his lawyer, stated that a comic character is not a person (a comic character is a comic character and nothing else) and that a person does not have cat ears, giant eyes, or a tail and that a person has a nose. Some of the pictures featured illustrations of characters with these unusual body parts. The prosecutor and an expert on child pornography argued that these body parts had no effect and that the comic characters indeed were persons. As examples of what is not a person, the child pornography expert mentioned The Simpsons and Donald Duck. The Court of Appeal upheld the former verdict, for 39 of the 51 pictures, and the monetary fine was reduced. It was immediately further appealed to the Supreme Court. While the Prosecutor General agreed with the verdict of the Court of Appeal, he still recommended that the Supreme Court hear the case, to clarify the issue, and the Supreme Court decided to do so. On 15 June 2012, the Supreme Court found him not guilty. They decided that the images were not realistic and could not be mistaken for real children, and that they therefore could not be counted as exceptions to the constitutional law of freedom of speech. One picture was still considered realistic enough to be defined as child pornography according to Swedish law. However, his possession of it was considered defensible through his occupation as a professional expert of Japanese culture, particularly manga.|$|E

People don't stop to realise the horrible tragedy of even one man's death--one man with his little circle of relatives and friends. In the game of war one forgets. Human beings--men from the toiler's bench, the carpenter's bench, from behind the counter, from the land, from the mine--don khaki, become soldiers, and there seems something different about them. So many human lives gone every day; just soldiers, just the toll we have to pay for a slight advance or a costly retreat. And, my God, every one of them, underneath their khaki, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being!</b> The politicians don't grasp it, Julian. That's our justification.

6000|$|At {{the time}} when the Constitution was adopted, three classes of persons were [...] "held to service" [...] in the country--apprentices, redemptioners, and slaves. The two first classes were by no means {{insignificant}} in 1789, and the redemptioners were rapidly increasing in numbers. In that day, it looked as if this speculative importation of laborers from Europe was to form a material part of the domestic policy of the Northern States. Now the negro <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> as well as an apprentice or a redemptioner, though the Constitution does not consider him as the equal of either. It is a great mistake to suppose that the Constitution of the United States, as it now exists, recognizes slavery in any manner whatever, unless it be to mark it as an interest that has less than the common claim to the ordinary rights of humanity. In the apportionment, or representation clause, the redemptioner and the apprentice counts each as a man, whereas five slaves are enumerated as only three free men. The free black is counted as a man, in all particulars, and is represented as such, but his fellow in slavery has only three fifths of his political value.|$|E

You can't, simply because a child <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> and {{we do not want to}} lose sight of the being we love. So long as the love lasts, the eye would follow its steps because--we are what we are, and a mere image in the mind doesn't satisfy the heart. Love is never satisfied, and asks not for less and less each day but for more--always for more. Then, too, love is credulous; it believes and imagines all things and, like all emotions, it pushes reason and experience aside and sticks to the belief that these beautiful qualities cannot die and leave nothing behind: they are not on the surface only; they have their sweet permanent roots in the very heart and centre of being." ...|$|E
