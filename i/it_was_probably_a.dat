5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> fairly small site. At this time some of its {{satellite}} sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of {{which would have been}} small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Yi {{was listed}} as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese {{officials}} said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of The Houston Chronicle reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi {{is not the first}} Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.|$|E
5|$|Milton Blockhouse was an {{artillery}} fortification constructed {{as part of}} Henry VIII's Device plan of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England. It was built at Milton, near Gravesend in Kent at a strategic point along the River Thames, and was operational by 1540. Equipped with 30 pieces of artillery and a garrison of 12 men and a captain, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> two-storey, D-shaped building, designed to prevent enemy ships from progressing further up the river or landing an invasion force. It was stripped of its artillery in 1553 and was demolished between 1557 and 1558; nothing remains of the building above ground, although archaeological investigations in the 1970s uncovered parts of the blockhouse's foundations.|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{back the}} comet's orbital motion {{revealed}} {{that it had}} been orbiting Jupiter for some time. It is likely that it was captured from a solar orbit in the early 1970s, although the capture may have occurred as early as the mid-1960s. Several other observers found images of the comet in precovery images obtained before March 24, including Kin Endate from a photograph exposed on March 15, S. Otomo on March 17, and a team led by Eleanor Helin from images on March 19. No precovery images dating back to earlier than March 1993 have been found. Before the comet was captured by Jupiter, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> short-period comet with an aphelion just inside Jupiter's orbit, and a perihelion interior to the asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> tire rubbing against the car. During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin {{had moved to the}} 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Present-day {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} Scots law before the eleventh century is largely speculative, with no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including British, Irish and Anglo-Saxon customs. The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, set out a system of compensation for injury and death based on ranks and the solidarity of kin groups. There were popular courts, the comhdhail, indicated by dozens of place names throughout eastern Scotland. In Scandinavian-held areas Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl, and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At these sessions decisions were made, laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the canal is just {{to the north of}} the river, and a public {{footpath}} follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment.|$|E

25|$|A 1981 {{study of}} a {{deceased}} triploid XXX twin fetus without a heart showed that although its fetal development suggested {{that it was an}} identical twin, as it shared a placenta with its healthy twin, tests revealed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> polar body twin.

25|$|Papyrus 49 (Gregory-Aland), {{designated}} by 49, {{is an early}} copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Epistle to the Ephesians, surviving in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been palaeographically assigned to the 3rd century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{part of the same}} manuscript as Papyrus 65. It came from Egypt and was purchased for the Yale University Library. Textually it is close to the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus. The text of the manuscript has been published several times.|$|E
25|$|The town (not {{counting}} the Roman villages now within its boundaries) {{is believed to}} have been founded by Anglo-Saxons around AD 600. In AD 853, Æthelswith (sister to Alfred the Great) married King Burgred of Mercia at Chippenham. Alfred was then a boy of four and the wedding was held on the site of St Andrew's church. According to Bishop Asser's Life of King Alfred, Chippenham was, under Alfred's reign, a royal vill; historians have also argued, from its proximity to the royal forests at Melksham and Barden, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> hunting lodge. Alfred's daughter was also married in Chippenham.|$|E

25|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} Little Petra was {{established}} in the 1st century C.E., when the Nabataean culture was at its peak in the region. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> suburb of the larger city to the south, perhaps where its more successful merchants lived, and entertained their visiting counterparts. The location may have been chosen because of the nearby older settlement of Beidha, inhabited since the earlier Neolithic era. Since investigations of the site have generally focused on the Nabataean and earlier periods, it is not known whether it was still inhabited around the same time Petra itself was ultimately abandoned, in the 7th century.|$|E
25|$|A pugio was {{a dagger}} used by Roman soldiers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> sidearm. Like other items of legionary equipment, the dagger {{underwent}} some changes during the 1st century. Generally, {{it had a}} large, leaf-shaped blade 18 to 28cm long and 5cm or more in width. A raised midrib {{ran the length of}} each side, either simply standing out from the face or defined by grooves on either side. It was changed by making the blade a little thinner, about 3 mm, and the handle was also made out of metal. The tang was wide and flat initially, and the grip was riveted through it, as well as through the shoulders of the blade.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that of this multiplicity of protocells, only one line survived. Current phylogenetic {{evidence suggests that the}} last universal ancestor (LUA) lived during the early Archean eon, perhaps 3.5Ga or earlier. This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> prokaryote, possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Like modern cells, it used DNA as its genetic code, RNA for information transfer and protein synthesis, and enzymes to catalyze reactions. Some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor, there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by lateral gene transfer.|$|E
