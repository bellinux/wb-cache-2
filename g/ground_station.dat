5|$|In the 1990s, NSC {{operated}} Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS), {{which was}} used as a <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> for a limited number of satellites. After Rolf Skår was appointed director of NSC, plans were launched to try to win the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> at Longyearbyen.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> {{and when the}} response is received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E
5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E

50|$|XMM-Newton {{mission control}} {{is located at}} the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. Two <b>ground</b> <b>stations,</b> located in Perth and Kourou, are used to {{maintain}} continuous contact with the spacecraft through most of its orbit. Back-up <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> are located in Villafranca del Castillo, Santiago, and Dongara. Because XMM-Newton contains no on-board data storage, science data is transmitted to these <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> in real time.|$|R
40|$|A {{satellite}} communications system includes an orbiting communications satellite for relaying communications {{to and from}} a plurality of <b>ground</b> <b>stations,</b> and a network management center for making connections via the satellite between the <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> in response to connection requests received via the satellite from the <b>ground</b> <b>stations,</b> the network management center being configured to provide both open-end service and closed-end service. The network management center of one embodiment is configured to provides both types of service according to a predefined channel access protocol that enables the <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> to request the type of service desired. The channel access protocol may be configured to adaptively allocate channels to open-end service and closed-end service according {{to changes in the}} traffic pattern and include a free-access tree algorithm that coordinates collision resolution among the <b>ground</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's ownership in TSS and Lockheed Martin's ownership in SvalSat in 2001. On 1 February 2002, NSC and Kongsberg Spacetec merged their interests in satellite technology and operations into Kongsberg Satellite Station, which became the sole owner of both SvalSat and TSS. Legally, Kongsberg Satellite Services is a continuation of the operating company of TSS. KSAT opened Troll Satellite Station in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the <b>ground</b> <b>station.</b> This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the <b>ground</b> <b>station.</b> Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

5|$|Landsat 2 {{transmitted}} {{its data}} to several international <b>ground</b> <b>stations.</b> The <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> were located on {{six of the}} seven continents, with the first beginning operations in April 1975 in Prince Albert, Canada, and the last to begin operations in December 1981 in Hartebeesthoek, South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Cospas-Sarsat defines {{standards}} for beacons, auxiliary equipment to be mounted on conforming weather and communication satellites, <b>ground</b> <b>stations,</b> and communications methods. The satellites communicate the beacon data to their <b>ground</b> <b>stations,</b> which forward it to main control centers of each nation that can initiate a rescue effort.|$|R
5|$|The data/messages {{from the}} {{aircraft}} are transmitted by the aircraft's Satellite Data Unit (SDU) and relayed via satellite to a <b>ground</b> <b>station,</b> {{where they are}} routed to other communication networks to reach their destination. Messages may also {{be sent to the}} aircraft, in reverse order. When passing through the satellite, the signals are amplified and translated in frequency—mixed with the signal from an oscillator in the satellite, leaving the satellite at the combined frequency. Transmissions from the aircraft are made on one of several channels (frequencies) near 1.6GHz, combined with frequency of the satellite's oscillator, and transmitted to the GES at the combined frequency (one of several channels near 3.6GHz). The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> then translates the received signal before it reaches equipment to be processed. The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> keeps a log of transmissions and some data about them.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 was {{launched}} at 13:57:04 UTC on 8 April 2010. Following a successful launch, CryoSat-2 {{separated from the}} upper stage of the Dnepr into a low Earth orbit. The first signals from the satellite were detected by a <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> at the Broglio Space Centre in Malindi, Kenya, seventeen minutes after launch.|$|E
5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the <b>ground</b> <b>station.</b> The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E

50|$|Oboe {{was limited}} to one {{aircraft}} because the onboard transponder would send pulses every time the <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> queried them. If more than one aircraft turned on their Oboe, the <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> would start to receive several return pulses for every query, with no way to distinguish between them.|$|R
5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> {{optimized for}} low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being TrollSat at Troll in Antarctica. These {{are the only}} two <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> able to see a polar-orbiting satellite on every revolution. By using both stations, customers can communicate with a satellite twice per orbit.|$|R
5|$|On 8 March, Inmarsat {{provided}} basic {{flight data}} relating to Flight 370 to SITA, which relayed information to Malaysia Airlines and investigators. On 9–10 March, Inmarsat engineers {{noted that the}} <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> log recorded pings from the aircraft for several hours after contact was lost with air traffic control. Malaysian investigators set up an international working group, consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the <b>ground</b> <b>station,</b> especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, AAIB, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US NTSB and FAA; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E
5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Malaysian {{investigators}} set up {{an international}} working group—the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)—consisting of various agencies with experience in aircraft performance and satellite communications, to further analyse the signals between Flight 370 and the <b>ground</b> <b>station,</b> especially the signal at 08:19. These included representatives from the UK's Inmarsat, Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and Rolls-Royce; China's Civil Aviation Administration and Aircraft Accident Investigation Department; the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration; and Malaysian authorities.|$|E

40|$|A {{system is}} {{described}} {{for determining the}} position of a vehicle or other target that emits radio waves and which is of the type that senses the difference in time of arrival at spaced <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> of signals from the vehicle to locate the vehicle on a set of intersecting hyperbolas. A network of four <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> detects the radio emissions from the vehicle and by means of cross correlation derives the relative signal delay at the <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> from which the vehicle position is deduced. Because the signal detection is by cross correlation, no knowledge of the emission is needed, which makes even unintentional radio noise emissions usable as a locator beacon. By positioning one of the four <b>ground</b> <b>stations</b> at an elevation significantly above the plane of the other three stations, a three dimensional fix on the vehicle is possible...|$|R

5|$|The {{combined}} SDU and <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> bias {{was calculated}} from 17 signals exchanged between the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> and the aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish {{the accuracy of}} their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the maximum range of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> is {{connected}} to KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and SvalSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief inspector {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector. The <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E

5|$|Additional {{factors that}} affect the BFO are a {{translation}} made at the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|In the Norwegian Government's {{internal}} evaluation, FFI {{stated that}} as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment. Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
