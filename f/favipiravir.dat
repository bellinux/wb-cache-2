In tests on mice, JK-05 was claimed to show efficacy against a range of RNA viruses, including influenza, Ebola virus and yellow fever, as well as several arenaviruses and bunyaviruses. The chemical structure of JK-05 has not been disclosed as of October 2014, but it is claimed to be a small molecule drug with a comparatively simple structure, which should be readily amenable to synthesis scale-up for mass production if testing is successful. The drug is however admitted to be similar to the Japanese anti-influenza drug <b>favipiravir,</b> developed by Fujifilm Holdings Corp, which has been used effectively to treat patients with Ebola. In addition, WHO committee members mentioned that the drug is a copy product of <b>favipiravir,</b> because patents of <b>favipiravir</b> were already registered in 2006 in China. The drug has been given preliminary approval by the Chinese authorities to be available for Chinese health workers involved in combating the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, or if Ebola were to spread into mainland China.

40|$|AbstractFavipiravir, a viral RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} inhibitor, {{has recently}} been approved in Japan for influenza pandemic preparedness. Here, we conducted a cell-based screening system to evaluate the susceptibility of influenza viruses to <b>favipiravir.</b> In this assay, the antiviral activity of <b>favipiravir</b> is determined by inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect, which can be measured by using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. To demonstrate the robustness of the assay, we compared the <b>favipiravir</b> susceptibilities of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor-resistant influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, A(H 3 N 2), A(H 7 N 9) and B viruses and their sensitive counterparts. No {{significant differences in the}} <b>favipiravir</b> susceptibilities were found between NA inhibitor-resistant and sensitive viruses. We, then, examined the antiviral susceptibility of 57 pairs of influenza viruses isolated from patients pre- and post-administration of <b>favipiravir</b> in phase 3 clinical trials. We found that there were no viruses with statistically significant reduced susceptibility to <b>favipiravir</b> or NA inhibitors, although two of 20 paired A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, one of 17 paired A(H 3 N 2) and one of 20 paired B viruses possessed amino acid substitutions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits, PB 1, PB 2 and PA, after <b>favipiravir</b> administration.

40|$|This deposit is {{composed}} {{by the main}} article plus the supplementary materials of the publication. Influenza virus inflicts a heavy death toll annually and resistance to existing antiviral drugs has generated interest {{in the development of}} agents with novel mechanisms of action. <b>Favipiravir</b> is an antiviral drug that acts by increasing the genome-wide mutation rate of influenza A virus (IAV). Potential synergistic benefits of combining oseltamivir and <b>favipiravir</b> have been demonstrated in animal models of influenza, but the population-level effects of combining the drugs are unknown. In order to elucidate the underlying evolutionary processes at play, we performed genome-wide sequencing of IAV experimental populations subjected to serial passaging in vitro under a combined protocol of oseltamivir and <b>favipiravir.</b> We describe the interplay between mutation, selection, and genetic drift that ultimately culminates in population extinction. In particular, selective sweeps around oseltamivir resistance mutations reduce genome-wide variation while deleterious mutations hitchhike to fixation given the increased mutational load generated by <b>favipiravir.</b> This latter effect reduces viral fitness and accelerates extinction compared with IAV populations treated with <b>favipiravir</b> alone, but risks spreading both established and newly emerging mutations, including possible drug resistance mutations, if transmission occurs before the viral populations are eradicated.

40|$|With up to 500, 000 infections annually, Lassa virus (LASV), {{the cause}} of Lassa fever, {{is one of the}} most {{prevalent}} etiological agents of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans.

All viruses were tested in a plaque reduction assay with MDCK cells, and a subset was also tested in both yield reduction and focus inhibition (FI) assays. For the majority of viruses tested, <b>favipiravir</b> significantly inhibited plaque formation at 3. 2 M (0. 5 g/ml) (50 % effective concentrations [EC 50 s] of 0. 19 to 22. 48 M and 0. 03 to 3. 53 g/ml), and for all viruses, {{with the exception of a}} single dually resistant 2009 A(H 1 N 1) virus, complete inhibition of plaque formation was seen at 3. 2 M (0. 5 g/ml).

Presently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat severe RVFV infection in humans. We have previously reported on the activity of <b>favipiravir</b> (T- 705) against the MP- 12 vaccine strain of RVFV and other bunyaviruses in cell culture.

We reported earlier that <b>favipiravir</b> inhibits the in vitro replication of CHIKV and protects against disease progression in CHIKV-infected immunodeficient mice. We here explored whether <b>favipiravir</b> is also able to inhibit CHIKV replication in the joints of mice either when treatment is initiated during the acute or during the chronic phase of the infection. To this end, C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were infected with CHIKV in the left hind footpad and treatment with <b>favipiravir</b> (300  mg/kg/day, orally) was either given from day 0 to day 3 post-infection (p. i.) or from day 49 to day 55 p. i. In the untreated mice, viral RNA was still detectable in the joints up to 98 days p. i., yet no infectious viral particles were observed in these tissues. The 4 days treatment during the acute phase of the infection resulted in complete inhibition of systemic viral spread. As a consequence, no viral RNA was detected in the non-inoculated feet in contrast to the situation in the untreated control mice. When treatment was initiated at day 49 p. i., no significant reduction in viral RNA levels in joints were noted as compared to the untreated control. Interestingly, when attempting to amplify by RT-PCR material corresponding to virus genome from the chronic phase samples, some parts of the genome, such as the viral polymerase gene could not be amplified.

Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of Pichindé virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T- 705 (<b>Favipiravir),</b> a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD(50) of ∼ 5 plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection. <b>Favipiravir</b> (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICV-induced disease even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia.

Using antibodies targeting specific integrin chains, we found infection of Vero E 6 cells with MPRLV to be dependent on β 3 -integrins, similar to that reported for other pathogenic hantaviruses such as Dobrava virus (DOBV) included in our studies. β 1 -integrin chain-specific antibodies and fibronectin did not block MPRLV or DOBV infectivity as observed with the nonpathogenic Prospect Hill Virus (PHV). Phylogenic analysis of characteristic degron sequences and ITAM motifs in the G 1 cytoplasmic tails of MPRLV and other hantaviruses emphasizes the close genetic proximity of MPRLV to other HPS-causing hantaviruses. <b>Favipiravir,</b> a pyrazine derivative reported to be active against related bunyaviruses, was found to be active against MPRLV, DOBV, and PHV (EC 50 = 65 - 93 µM) with therapeutic indexes of 74, 52, and 58, respectively. The data presented suggests that MPRLV may be pathogenic to humans and that it and other hantaviruses tested are sensitive to <b>favipiravir</b> in cell culture...|$|E
40|$|Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD) {{is a highly}} lethal {{condition}} for which no specific treatment has proven efficacy. In September 2014, while the Ebola outbreak was at its peak, the World Health Organization released {{a short list of}} drugs suitable for EVD research. <b>Favipiravir,</b> an antiviral developed for the treatment of severe influenza, was one of these. In late 2014, the conditions for starting a randomized Ebola trial were not fulfilled for two reasons. One was the perception that, given the high number of patients presenting simultaneously and the very high mortality rate of the disease, it was ethically unacceptable to allocate patients from within the same family or village to receive or not receive an experimental drug, using a randomization process impossible to understand by very sick patients. The other was that, in the context of rumors and distrust of Ebola treatment centers, using a randomized design at the outset might lead even more patients to refuse to seek care. Therefore, we chose to conduct a multicenter non-randomized trial, in which all patients would receive <b>favipiravir</b> along with standardized care. The objectives of the trial were to test the feasibility and acceptability of an emergency trial {{in the context of a}} large Ebola outbreak, and to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of <b>favipiravir</b> in reducing mortality and viral load in patients with EVD. The trial was not aimed at directly informing future guidelines on Ebola treatment but at quickly gathering standardized preliminary data to optimize the design of future studies. Inclusion criteria were positive Ebola virus reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test, age ≥ 1 y, weight ≥ 10 kg, ability to take oral drugs, and informed consent. All participants received oral <b>favipiravir</b> (day 0 : 6, 000 mg; day 1 to day 9 : 2, 400 mg/d). Semi-quantitative Ebola virus RT-PCR (results expressed in "cycle threshold" [Ct]) and biochemistry tests were performed at day 0, day 2, day 4, end of symptoms, day 14, and day 30. Frozen samples were shipped to a reference biosafety level 4 laboratory for RNA viral load measurement using a quantitative reference technique (genome copies/milliliter). Outcomes were mortality, viral load evolution, and adverse events. The analysis was stratified by age and Ct value. A "target value" of mortality was defined a priori for each stratum, to guide the interpretation of interim and final analysis. Between 17 December 2014 and 8 April 2015, 126 patients were included, of whom 111 were analyzed (adults and adolescents, ≥ 13 y, n = 99; young children, ≤ 6 y, n = 12). Here we present the results obtained in the 99 adults and adolescents. Of these, 55 had a baseline Ct value ≥ 20 (Group A Ct ≥ 20), and 44 had a baseline Ct value < 20 (Group A Ct < 20). Ct values and RNA viral loads were well correlated, with Ct = 20 corresponding to RNA viral load = 7. 7 log 10 genome copies/ml. Mortality was 20 % (95 % CI 11. 6 %- 32. 4 %) in Group A Ct ≥ 20 and 91 % (95 % CI 78. 8 %- 91. 1 %) in Group A Ct < 20. Both mortality 95 % CIs included the predefined target value (30 % and 85 %, respectively). Baseline serum creatinine was ≥ 110 μmol/l in 48 % of patients in Group A Ct ≥ 20 (≥ 300 μmol/l in 14 %) and in 90 % of patients in Group A Ct < 20 (≥ 300 μmol/l in 44 %). In Group A Ct ≥ 20, 17 % of patients with baseline creatinine ≥ 110 μmol/l died, versus 97 % in Group A Ct < 20. In patients who survived, the mean decrease in viral load was 0. 33 log 10 copies/ml per day of follow-up. RNA viral load values and mortality were not significantly different between adults starting <b>favipiravir</b> within < 72 h of symptoms compared to others. <b>Favipiravir</b> was well tolerated. In the context of an outbreak at its peak, with crowded care centers, randomizing patients to receive either standard care or standard care plus an experimental drug was not felt to be appropriate. We did a non-randomized trial. This trial reaches nuanced conclusions. On the one hand, we do not conclude on the efficacy of the drug, and our conclusions on tolerance, although encouraging, are not as firm as they could have been if we had used randomization. On the other hand, we learned about how to quickly set up and run an Ebola trial, in close relationship with the community and non-governmental organizations; we integrated research into care so that it improved care; and we generated knowledge on EVD that is useful to further research. Our data illustrate the frequency of renal dysfunction and the powerful prognostic value of low Ct values. They suggest that drug trials in EVD should systematically stratify analyses by baseline Ct value, as a surrogate of viral load. They also suggest that <b>favipiravir</b> monotherapy merits further study in patients with medium to high viremia, but not in those with very high viremia. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 02329054...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the current}} Ebola {{epidemic}} in Western Africa, many healthcare workers have become infected. Some {{of these have}} been medically evacuated to hospitals in Europe and the USA. These clinical experiences provide unique insights into the course of Ebola virus disease under optimized condition within high level isolation units. Case presentation: A 50 -year-old Caucasian male physician contracted Ebola virus diseases in Sierra Leone and was medically evacuated to Italy. Few days after the admission {{the course of the}} illness was characterized by severe gastro-intestinal symptoms followed by respiratory failure, accompanied by pulmonary infiltration and high Ebola viral load in the bronchial aspirate and Plasmodium vivax co-infection. The patient received experimental antiviral therapy with <b>favipiravir,</b> convalescent plasma and ZMAb. Ebola viral load started to steadily decrease in the blood after ZMAb administration and became undetectable by day 19 after admission, while it persisted longer in urine samples. No temporal association was observed between viral load decay in plasma and administration of <b>favipiravir.</b> The patient completely recovered and was discharged 39 days after admission. Conclusions: This is the first case of Ebola-related interstitial pneumonia documented by molecular testing of lung fluid specimens. This reports underlines the pivotal role of fluid replacement and advanced life support with mechanical ventilation in the management of patients with Ebola virus diseases respiratory failure.

40|$|Background: Lassa and Junín viruses are {{the most}} {{prominent}} members of the Arenaviridae family of viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, respectively. At present, ribavirin is the only antiviral drug indicated for use in treatment of these diseases, but because of its limited efficacy in advanced cases of disease and its toxicity, safer and more effective antivirals are needed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of Pichindé virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T- 705 (<b>Favipiravir),</b> a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD 50 of, 5 plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection. <b>Favipiravir</b> (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICVinduced disease even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia. Antiviral activity and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in peak serum virus titers and AST concentrations in favipiravir-treated animals. Moreover, a sharp decrease in body temperature was observed shortly {{after the start of}} treatment. Oral ribavirin was also evaluated, and althoug...|$|E
