5|$|Croatia has a {{civil law}} legal {{system in which}} law arises {{primarily}} from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers, and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law {{is divided into two}} principal areas – private and public law. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully <b>harmonised</b> with the Community acquis. The main law in the county is the Constitution adopted on December 22, 1990.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Holst's version, {{there is a}} <b>harmonised</b> choral arrangement by Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott in the New Oxford Book of Carols, an arrangement by Antony Pitts in the Naxos Book of Carols and two arrangements by John Rutter; one for choir and full orchestra which emulates percussive medieval instrumentation, and another in his anthology Dancing Day for female or boys voices with harp or piano accompaniment. The Retrover Ensemble's performance for Naxos Records pairs the piece with Gaudete, another carol from Piae Cantiones.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Hawker Siddeley {{considered}} {{modifying the}} airframe for a joint specification for an aircraft by the RAF and Royal Navy. Between 1961 and 1965 the two services <b>harmonised</b> their specifications to preserve design commonality. However, the RAF's desired configuration {{was to take}} precedence over that of the Royal Navy's. A number of proposals were submitted– at one stage, a twin-Spey design was considered, then rejected. Following the Labour government's coming to power the project was cancelled in 1965. The Royal Navy would acquire the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, while the RAF continued to foster development of the P.1127(RAF), leading to the successful Harrier Jump Jet family.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were <b>harmonised</b> internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{a unitary}} {{democratic}} parliamentary republic. Following {{the collapse of}} the ruling Communist League, Croatia adopted a new constitution in 1990 – which replaced the 1974 constitution adopted by the Socialist Republic of Croatia – and organised its first multi-party elections. While the 1990 constitution remains in force, it has been amended four times since its adoptionin 1997, 2000, 2001 and 2010. Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991, which led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. Croatia's status as a country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992. Under its 1990 constitution, Croatia operated a semi-presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system. Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative, executive and judiciary powers. The legal system of Croatia is civil law and, along with the institutional framework, is strongly influenced by the legal heritage of Austria-Hungary. By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully <b>harmonised</b> with the Community acquis. Croatia became a member state of the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E

5|$|Wenger's {{preparations}} for the 2011–12 season were disrupted by player unrest. Though he insisted none of his top players would leave the club, Fàbregas eventually moved to Barcelona, while Gaël Clichy and Samir Nasri joined Manchester City. Suspensions and injuries left Wenger fielding an understrength side against Manchester United on 29 August 2011; Arsenal were trounced 8–2, which represented their worst defeat in 115 years. Needing to address the squad's lack of depth, Wenger completed a series of deals {{in the final days}} of the summer transfer window. He mostly brought in experienced players, such as Yossi Benayoun on loan from Chelsea, Everton's Mikel Arteta and Germany international Per Mertesacker. By October, Arsenal had made their worst start to a season in 58 years, losing four of their opening seven matches. However, the team soon <b>harmonised,</b> and in the same month club captain Robin van Persie scored a hat-trick as Arsenal beat Chelsea 5–3. Despite another season of no silverware, Wenger guided Arsenal to third position in the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League for a 15th successive campaign. Van Persie had scored 37 goals, in his first injury-free season for the club. He, however, grew disillusioned with Arsenal's transfer policy, and decided not to renew his contract, with one year remaining. When Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson learnt of the situation, he called Wenger to push through a deal and Van Persie agreed to join Manchester United in August 2012. The club purchased strikers Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski in anticipation of the sale.|$|E
