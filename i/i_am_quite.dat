5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and put on their behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> like a child.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

60|$|His stare {{was full}} of respectful curiosity. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> confounded.|$|R

500|$|While she dislikes being {{referred}} to as [...] "Bono's wife", she has said, [...] " [...] I really don't have a big problem with my own identity, because I am a very private person, so I've always let Bono take the brunt of anything that was coming along. He is happy to do that; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy {{to make my own}} way around things." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dear Lucy, Your letter gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I {{must tell you that}} no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require the money to buy comforts... However, as it is Christmas I will let you have 1/5/ – out of your banking account to buy lollies with." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1861, Tchaikovsky {{attended}} {{classes in}} music theory {{organized by the}} Russian Musical Society and taught by Nikolai Zaremba. A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post [...] "until <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." [...] From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{sure that}} you have all found these wanderings pleasant.|$|R
60|$|I {{assured her}} in a voice {{scarcely}} above a whisper that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> well again.|$|R
60|$|I {{assure you}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply.|$|R
500|$|The bailout {{referendum}} on 5 July {{resulted in a}} 'No' vote {{to the adoption of}} the bailout package. The following day, Varoufakis resigned as finance minister. As he left the finance ministry, he suggested that Tsakalotos was likely to succeed him, and Tsakalotos was subsequently sworn-in later that day. In the process of this, Tsakalotos relinquished his previous ministerial position of Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations. Tsakalotos was noted for his differences with Varoufakis, for example, the Financial Times noted that he [...] "could hardly be more different from his flamboyant predecessor". At a press conference shortly following his appointment, Tsakalotos said: [...] "I cannot hide from you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> nervous. I am not taking on this job at the easiest point in Greek history." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 September 2006, Alonso scored {{what the}} BBC {{described}} as [...] "an outrageous strike" [...] {{from his own}} half in a 2–0 Premiership win against Newcastle United. Andy Hunter of The Independent described it as [...] "one of the most audacious goals in Anfield's rich 115-year history". Alonso rebutted claims that his 70-yard goal was all down to luck and stated that he took long range shots {{as part of his}} training routine. Despite the similarity of the goals struck from inside his own half, Alonso was in no doubt which was his best. He said, [...] "I think this was better. The Luton goal bounced a few times, this one went quite straight. The Luton one was left-footed– it was different– but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy to score the goal." [...] It was his first goal for Liverpool since the goal against Luton, making distinct history as the only outfield player in modern professional football history to score two consecutive goals from inside his own half of the pitch.|$|E
500|$|Prince Frederick settled Anderson in {{a former}} army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, {{on the edge of}} the Black Forest, where she became a sort of tourist attraction. Lili Dehn, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and {{acknowledged}} her as Anastasia, but when Charles Sydney Gibbes, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud. In an affidavit, he swore [...] "She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> satisfied that she is an impostor." [...] She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay. In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health. Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death. Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter Gleb Botkin's offer to move to the United States.|$|E
60|$|I had dined; I had rested; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{ready to}} go out again, and I said so.|$|R
60|$|I {{replied that}} I had that intention, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{willing to go}} over the house first.|$|R
60|$|The gentlemen laughed, the Abbe the loudest, {{and told}} me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> welcome; such {{victories}} were esteemed honourable.|$|R
500|$|Leeds were {{resigned}} to losing their senior players after going into administration, with Championship club Stoke City signing Cresswell on {{a three-year contract}} for an undisclosed fee on 2 August 2007, after Hull City had pulled out of a deal after expressing concerns following his medical. He made his debut in a 1–0 win at Cardiff City on 11 August 2007, before scoring in his second appearance with an equaliser during stoppage time of extra time in a 2–2 draw away to Rochdale in the League Cup first round on 14 August, although Stoke lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out. He scored the last ever goal at Colchester United's Layer Road ground in a 1–0 win. Cresswell made 46 appearances for Stoke in 2007–08, scoring 12 goals, as the club won promotion into the Premier League as Championship runners-up. He was regularly used on the left wing by Stoke manager Tony Pulis, even though his natural position is as a striker. He {{was quoted as saying}} he enjoyed playing as a winger, saying [...] "I do my best, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> a fit lad so I get through quite a bit of mileage". During 2008–09, Cresswell played on the wing and as a striker, featuring in 34 matches and scoring one goal.|$|E
500|$|During the action, Tiger {{was hit by}} six German shells, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of which was a}} [...] shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 [...] shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and [...] Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a [...] "" [...] and adding [...] "The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to {{have had a lot of}} practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: [...] "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." [...] The ship was given a refit in December 1915.|$|E
2500|$|I have no {{knowledge}} of either Sanscrit or Arabic. But I have done what I could to form a correct estimate of their value. I have read translations of the most celebrated Arabic and Sanscrit works. I have conversed both here and at home with men distinguished by their proficiency in the Eastern tongues. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready to take the Oriental learning at the valuation of the Orientalists ...|$|E

60|$|SAVOYARD. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a lad, of course. But I {{had a job}} in the {{original}} production of Our Boys.|$|R
60|$|Lady Glyde {{turned away}} from me suddenly, with an {{appearance}} of despair, for which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> unable to account.|$|R
2500|$|In {{one of her}} 2000s {{interviews}} Shatskaya {{described her}} family as [...] "my mother and my brother [...] with his family." [...] She's never been married. [...] "This 'lack of love' does upset me, yes, but one has to agree that feisty, energetic and emotional men are very few, while others bore me," [...] she remarked in one interview, adding: [...] "In relationships I prefer to keep my distance. Otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> open and a very sociable person." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the way to}} {{her first}} meeting with him, she told Allen, [...] "Listen, Dick, I am an AFL-CIO Democrat and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> {{concerned}} that my meeting Ronald Reagan on any basis will be misunderstood." [...] She asked Reagan if he minded having a lifelong Democrat on his team; he replied that he himself had been a Democrat until he was 51, and in any event, he liked her way of thinking about American foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{year before}} the play opened, Gilbert told The Era, [...] "As I {{consider}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> as well qualified to judge of what is fit for the ears of a theatrical audience as [...] can be, I have systematically declined to take the slightest notice of his instructions". [...] The Happy Land is a blank verse musical burlesque of Gilbert's earlier play, The Wicked World. The plot roughly follows that of The Wicked World, with the disastrous powers of love replaced with the disaster of [...] "popular government".|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{relieved}} {{to find that}} it was only Brooks of Sheffield; for, at first, I really thought it <b>was</b> <b>I.</b>|$|R

2500|$|After the win Jwala at a {{press conference}} stated, [...] "It's unbelievable. I think it was long pending for me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> emotional. The feeling is yet to sink in. Ashwini played {{exceptionally}} well and we hope to continue the good work, I want to dedicate the medal to my family who stood by me, my coaches, especially SM Arif, Atik Jauhari and all the team members, Gopi. I owe this medal to all who helped me," [...] and added that [...] "This medal will silence my critics. This is my answer to them to whatever happened. I am very happy and everyone who has negative thoughts about me, I would like to say just shut-up now," ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When Jeanette MacDonald {{approached}} me for coaching lessons", wrote Lehmann, [...] "I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, {{would be able}} to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn’t have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me—and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure that Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The UN {{resolution}} {{does not}} specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan. Lord Caradon {{said that the}} parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. [...] "Nevertheless so important {{is the future of}} Jerusalem that it might be argued that we should have specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution. It is easy to say that now, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure that if we had attempted to raise or settle the question of Jerusalem as a separate issue at that time our task in attempting to find a unanimous decision would have been far greater if not impossible." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had drawn}} mine also, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{determined}} not to hurt this admirable {{young man who had}} been my benefactor.|$|R
60|$|She {{asked me}} this so kindly, {{and with such}} a gentle air, half playful and half sorrowful, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> touched.|$|R
