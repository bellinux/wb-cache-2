40|$|Background: To explain {{observed}} differences during SPF determination {{using either}} an in vivo or in vitro method, we hypothesized {{on the presence}} of ingredients having anti-inflammatory properties. Methodology/Principal Findings: To research our hypothesis, we studied the 21 UV filters both available on the market and authorized by European regulations and subjected these filters to the phorbol-myristate-acetate test using mice. We then catalogued the 13 filters demonstrating a significant anti-inflammatory effect with edema inhibition percentages of more than 70 %. The filters are: diethylhexyl butamido triazone (92 %), benzophenone- 5 and titanium dioxide (90 %), benzophenone- 3 (83 %), octocryleÌ€ne and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> (82 %), PEG- 25 PABA and homosalate (80 %), octyl triazone and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (78 %), octyl dimethyl PABA (75 %), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexylbenzoate (70 %). These filters were tested at various concentrations, including their maximum authorized dose. We detected a dose-response relationship. Conclusions/Significance: The anti-inflammatory effect of a sunscreen ingredient may affect the in vivo SPF value...|$|E
