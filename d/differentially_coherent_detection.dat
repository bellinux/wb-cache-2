40|$|Abstract—An {{adaptive}} equalization {{method is}} proposed {{for use with}} <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> <b>detection</b> of M-ary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals {{in the presence of}} unknown carrier frequency offset. A decision-feedback or a linear equalizer is employed, followed by the differentially coherent detector. The equalizer coefficients are adjusted to minimize the post-detection mean squared error. The error, which is a quadratic function of the equalizer vector, is used to design an adaptive algorithm of stochastic gradient type. The approach differs from those proposed previously, which linearize the post-detection error to enable the use of least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive equalizers. The proposed quadratic-error (Q) algorithm has complexity comparable to that of LMS, and equal convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate performance improvement over methods based on linearized-error (L) algorithm. The main advantages of the technique proposed are its simplicity of implementation and robustness to carrier frequency offset, which is maintained for varying modulation level.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} technology {{has seen a}} remarkably fast evolution due to its capability to provide a quality, reliable and high-speed data transmission amongst the users. However, transmission of information in wireless channels is primarily impaired by deleterious multipath fading, which affects the quality and reliability of the system. In order to overcome the detrimental effects of fading, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology is an attractive scheme that employs multiple transceiver antennas to carry the data over the same frequency band over a variety of signal paths. This technology has shown great solutions due to its ability to provide better spectral efficiency, capacity, throughput and robustness of the data transmission. But in practice, it is impractical to install multiple antennas on small-sized devices. Hence, to overcome the limitations of MIMO gain in the future wireless networks, cooperative diversity has recently draw in attention due to its ability to circumvent the difficulties of implementing actual antenna arrays in Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO). By exploiting the broadcast feature of the wireless medium, cooperation among multiple nearby nodes is formed for data transmission. At the receiver, the signals are either coherently or <b>differentially</b> detected. <b>Coherent</b> <b>detection</b> requires exact channel estimation, which is difficult to apply in a time-varying channel.

40|$|A {{high bit}} rate {{acoustic}} link for underwater video transmission is examined. Currently, encoding standards support video transmission at bit rates as low as 64 kbps. While this rate is still above the limit of commercially available acoustic modems, prototype acoustic modems based on phase coherent modulation/detection have demonstrated successful transmission at 30 kbps over a deep water channel. The key to bridging the remaining gap between the bit-rate needed for video transmission and that supported by the acoustic channel lies in two approaches: use of efficient image/video compression algorithms and use of high-level bandwidth-efficient modulation methods. An experimental system, based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) and Huffman entropy coding for image compression, and variable rate M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) was implemented. Phase-coherent equalization is accomplished by joint operation of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a second order phase locked loop (PLL). System performance is demonstrated experimentally, using transmission rate of 25000 symbols/sec at a carrier frequency of 75 kHz over a 10 m vertical path. (cont.) Excellent results were obtained, thus demonstrating bit rates as high as 150 kbps, which are sufficient for real-time transmission of compressed video. As an alternative to conventional QAM signaling, whose high-level constellations are sensitive to phase distortions induced by the channel, M-ary differential amplitude and phase shift keying (DAPSK) was used.
