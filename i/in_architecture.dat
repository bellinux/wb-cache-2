5|$|Gaudí {{is usually}} {{considered}} the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification.

His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>architecture,</b> Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings.

His major feat of engineering was building {{the dome of the}} Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
