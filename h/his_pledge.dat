5|$|As Leighton was {{unlikely}} to be dislodged, Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club, and fulfilled <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> when he sold him for £100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986. The transfer nearly went through {{in the summer of}} 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.|$|E
5|$|Before St. Clare {{can follow}} through on <b>his</b> <b>pledge,</b> however, he dies after being stabbed outside of a tavern. His wife reneges on her late husband's vow and sells Tom at auction to a vicious {{plantation}} owner named Simon Legree. Legree (a transplanted northerner) takes Tom and Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time) to rural Louisiana, where they meet Legree's other slaves.|$|E

50|$|Stood {{again as}} an {{independent}} in 1880. He had a belligerent attitude to politics, he published <b>his</b> <b>pledges</b> in <b>his</b> own broadsheet, The Redcliffe Review, and he was satirized in local cartoons.|$|R
5|$|Hayes kept <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> {{not to run}} for re-election, {{retired to}} his home in Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Beshear was {{the first}} {{candidate}} to announce his bid for the post of Attorney General of Kentucky in the 1979 election. Shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General Robert F. Stephens. The central issue of Beshear's campaign was <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> to be an advocate of the consumer in cases of proposed utility rate hikes. After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder {{by a vote of}} 471,177 to 302,951. When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Supreme Court, Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January. As attorney general, Beshear created the state's first Medicaid fraud division and his office took {{a leading role in the}} Leviticus Project, an eight-state coalition committed to prosecuting organized crime in the country's coal fields.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
50|$|Sarkozy {{was elected}} President of the French Republic in May 2007. Amongst <b>his</b> <b>pledges</b> was a re-negotiation and {{ratification}} of a mini-treaty without a referendum. Eventually, {{the new version}} of the text, the Lisbon Treaty, was voted by the Parliament.|$|R

50|$|On 28 January 2010, Ghani {{attended}} the International Conference on Afghanistan in London, <b>pledging</b> <b>his</b> support {{to help rebuild}} their country. Ghani presented his ideas to Karzai {{as an example of}} the importance of cooperation among Afghans and with the international community, supporting Karzai's reconciliation strategy. Ghani said hearing Karzai's second inaugural address in November 2009 and <b>his</b> <b>pledges</b> to fight corruption, promote reconciliation and replace international security forces persuaded him to help.|$|R
5|$|Hayes {{declined}} to seek re-election in 1880, keeping <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> {{that he would}} not run for a second term. He was gratified with the election of fellow Ohio Republican James A. Garfield to succeed him, and consulted with him on appointments for the next administration. After Garfield's inauguration, Hayes and his family returned to Spiegel Grove. In 1881, he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He served as commander-in-chief (national president) of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893. Although he remained a loyal Republican, Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland's election to the Presidency in 1884, approving of the New York Democrat's views on civil service reform. He was also pleased at the progress of the political career of William McKinley, his army comrade and political protégé.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on <b>his</b> <b>pledge,</b> and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
60|$|He sat quite still. A rush of {{thoughts}} had crowded into his brain. First and foremost was {{the thought of}} Geraldine. If he could cover up his traces!

2500|$|Schiff was polling {{at roughly}} 10% {{days before the}} {{convention}} and told many of <b>his</b> <b>pledged</b> delegates at the convention to switch to Simmons [...] "because I didn't think McMahon was playing fair."

5|$|His {{lieutenant}} at Basra, the Hashimi Abd al-Rahman ibn Abbas, tried but {{was unable}} to hold the city, as the populace opened the gates in exchange for a pardon after a few days. Abd al-Rahman too withdrew with as many Basrans as would follow him to Kufa, where Ibn al-Ash'ath's forces swelled further with the arrival of large numbers of anti-Umayyad volunteers. After taking control of Basra—and executing some 11,000 of its people, despite <b>his</b> <b>pledge</b> of pardon—al-Hajjaj marched on Kufa in April 701. His army was harassed by Ibn al-Ash'ath's cavalry, but reached the environs of the city and set up camp at Dayr Qurra, on the right bank of the Euphrates so as to secure his lines of communication with Syria. In response Ibn al-Ash'ath left Kufa and with an army reportedly 200,000 strong approached al-Hajjaj's army and set up camp at Dayr al-Jamajim. Both armies fortified their camps by digging trenches and, as before, engaged in skirmishes. Whatever the true numbers of Ibn al-Ash'ath's force, al-Hajjaj was in a difficult position: his army was considerably outnumbered by the rebels, although reinforcements from Syria were constantly arriving, and his position was difficult to resupply with provisions.|$|E

Therefore, d'Amboise threw his support to Piccolomini.|$|R
