40|$|Despite {{the well}} known role of {{nucleotide}} oligomerization domain (NOD) receptor proteins in innate immunity, {{their association with}} diabetes is less explored. Here we report the transcriptional level of NODs and their downstream molecular signatures in CD 14 (+) monocytes from subjects with different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> glucose <b>tolerance.</b> NOD 1 and NOD 2 mRNA expression were significantly up-regulated in monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and positively correlated with HOMA-IR and poor glycemic control. Patients with T 2 DM also exhibited increased monocyte activation markers (CD 11 b and CD 36) and proinflammatory signals downstream of NOD (RIPK 2 and NFκB) along with the increased circulatory levels of TNF-α and IL- 6. In vitro stimulation of monocytes with NOD specific ligands-i-EDAP and MDP significantly up regulated the mRNA expression of NOD 1 and NOD 2 respectively in T 2 DM. Our study exposes up regulation of NODs in monocytes as {{an important component of}} inflammation and insulin resistance in patients with T 2 D...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{to be a better}} risk factor than total white blood cell count in the prediction of adverse outcomes in various medical conditions. This study analyzed the association of NLR with different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> glucose <b>tolerance</b> and insulin resistance in Asian Indians. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study subjects were recruited from Phase 3 of the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES). For this cross-sectional analysis, subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n= 237), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n= 63), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (n= 286) were selected. The hemogram was done in all subjects using a five-part hematology analyzer (model SF- 3000; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The NLR was calculated as the ratio between counts for neutrophils and total lymphocytes. Fasting insulin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: Subjects with DM showed a significantly higher NLR (2. 2 ± 1. 12) compared with IGT subjects (1. 82 ± 0. 63), who in turn had a higher ratio than NGT subjects (1. 5 ± 0. 41) (P< 0. 01). Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation of NLR with glycated hemoglobin (r= 0. 411), fasting plasma glucose (r= 0. 378), and HOMA-IR (r= 0. 233) (P< 0. 001). Regression analysis showed a linear increase in NLR with increasing severity of glucose intolerance even after adjusting for age, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the correlation of NLR with different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. NLR can be used as an adjuvant prognostic marker for macro- and microvascular complications in patients with glucose intolerance...|$|R
500|$|Moulding {{tolerance}} is {{a specified}} allowance on the deviation in parameters such as dimensions, weights, shapes, or angles, etc. To maximise control in setting tolerances {{there is usually}} a minimum and maximum limit on thickness, based on the process used. Injection moulding typically is capable <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> equivalent to an IT <b>Grade</b> <b>of</b> about 9–14. The possible <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> a thermoplastic or a thermoset is ±0.200 to ±0.500millimetres.

40|$|The central {{thesis of}} this paper is that, for most issues of multiculturalism, {{regarding}} them as a problem <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> puts us on the wrong track because there are certain biases inherent in the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> These biases - individualism, combined with a focus on religion and a focus on beliefs rather than on persons or practices - can be regarded as distinctly Protestant. Extending the scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> may seem a solution but if we really want to counter these biases, the principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> becomes so general that it loses any distinctive meaning. Therefore, we should accept the limited scope <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and its biases. The principle <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> can still be useful for some problems where there is a clear and direct link to political or religious beliefs. Moreover, it should be cherished as a more general attitude or practice in Dutch society. For most problems of multiculturalism, however, we should appeal to broader theoretical frameworks that do justice to persons and practices. ...|$|R

A conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> is set out, elucidating how tolerance can have different types of objects, assessments and responses, the latter ranging from static disapproval to dynamic cognitive adjustment. We argue that public policy should consider these foundations <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and appreciate the context-dependent nature <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> rather than setting out to tightly define the boundaries of intolerance; the latter strategy runs the risk of stimulating a downward spiral whereby people’s thresholds <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are continually lowered...|$|R

The acceptance of the Other is the complete and powerful meaning <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Accep- tance ends where the very presence of the concept <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> is undermined and compromised by its history of colonialism and exploitation.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} interview study aiming {{to examine the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{as it is a}} core value in the curriculum for the Swedish upper secondary school and high school. The concept <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> is linked to the subject of religious studies. A total of six teachers were interviewed regarding their understanding and interpretation of the concept, as well as its place in their teaching. The method of analysis was hermeneutic and the statements made by the teachers were further analyzed in the light of normcritical pedagogy and didactical awareness. The results show a diversified understanding of the concept, manifested in a broad scale of attitudes to it, ranging from negative to positive, though all were based on a reflective approach. This affected the teachers' tendency to include, or focus on, the concept <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> in their teaching, varying from active inclusion to exclusion. The discussion focuses on the differences and difficulties associated with acts <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> versus attitudes <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The teachers define religious studies as a subject with heavy focus on interpersonal relations. Acts <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> are therefore problematic as they are also acts of power between individuals and groups. This shows the didactical importance of discussing the concept <b>of</b> <b>tolerance,</b> mainly in relation to attitudes and acts, between teachers {{as well as in the}} classroom...|$|R

40|$|The {{attainment}} <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{remains a}} highly desirable goal in recipients of kidney transplants. Achievement of this goal would extend graft survival and eradicate toxicities related to long-term immunosuppression. Understanding mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> and strategies to induce tolerance - their risk/benefit profiles - {{is essential for}} future success. Mechanistic studies of spontaneously tolerant kidney transplant recipients have uncovered potential roles for B or regulatory T cells, or both, in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Mixed hematopoietic chimerism {{has been the most}} commonly used approach to induce tolerance. Distinct protocols at three major transplant centers have led to successful withdrawal of immunosuppression in a subset of living donor kidney transplant recipients at the expense of complications such as infections and graft versus host disease. The addition of regulatory cell therapies to tolerance induction protocols could enhance success while minimizing complications. This review summarizes the features <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>tolerance</b> in kidney transplant recipients, the results of clinical trials <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction in the context of living donor kidney transplant, and potential measures to improve the safety and efficacy <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> induction strategies...|$|R
