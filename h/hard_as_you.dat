500|$|After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby {{returned}} {{to work for the}} Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a [...]255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team's average was [...]284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season second in team batting average (to the Yankees and Red Sox, each with a [...]281 average) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. [...] "It's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams", Doby said after being named White Sox manager.|$|E
2500|$|Recruited {{from the}} Christian Young Men's Society in 1931, Curcio was a tough, hard ruckman, who also played {{well in the}} back line. He was [...] for {{protecting}} his smaller teammates. A bass violinist, Curcio combined his musical talents with his football prowess, but stood {{out of the game}} in 1937 to concentrate on his music. Ever conscious of safegarding his hands to work the strings of the bass violin, he once told North Melbourne's Fred Fairweather, Hit me as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, but don't hurt my fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] said O'Hara to Trevor, as {{they faced}} one another, [...] "and hit as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like. It won't be any {{practice}} if you don't. I sha'n't mind being hit. It'll do me good for Aldershot. See?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Move from easy to difficult, {{and from}} simple to complicated. More time is {{required}} to train longer and <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> progress. Do not hurry or engage in senseless or reckless practice. Develop gradually.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want 'ee to {{come down}} to the owld shaft with me, an' when I give 'ee the ward cut away <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>thee</b> legs can spank to Balaswidden, an' fetch the lads that are theere to the owld shaft. They knaw what to do, but tell 'em to make so little noise as they can. Dost a hear, my son?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{admit that}} it is the first of all duties, but it is {{sometimes}} perhaps the <b>hardest,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say. Still, you could surely do yourself more justice without any great effort. If you wish to live humbly, you can do so without pretending to be an uneducated man and without taking an irritating and absurd name. Why on earth do you call yourself Smilash?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, Harry!" [...] the lad said cheerfully; [...] "hit me as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, {{under the}} {{circumstances}} I feel that I cannot kick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Came in the car, didn't you? Go off for Irvine as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can drive. Drop {{somebody}} {{at my place}} to run back with a gun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get into my sleigh, {{and drive}} to Harper's as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can!" [...] he said. [...] "Curtis was there when I passed; bring him here at once!" ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're really <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> up <b>as</b> <b>you</b> pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|R
50|$|In {{the trial}} {{mountains}} {{you will have}} to play Make 10 games to clear a path {{to the top of the}} mountain. Once you defeat the Local Make 10 Champ in a Make 10 contest you will be able to ascend further up the mountain. At base 5 {{you will have to}} beat a Grand Champ and at base 10, a Super Champ. The Make 10 Games will grow steadily <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> progress up the mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, try and hit {{me on the}} nose," [...] {{he would}} say, {{standing}} before them in an attitude of defence. [...] "Don't be afraid. Hit <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, you {{can drive}} {{one of those big}} Siwash craft as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can this sloop; that is, so long as you keep the sea astern of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then row as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] replied Captain Langless. He was at {{one pair}} of oars while Arnold Baxter was at another. Dan sat in the bow.|$|E

6000|$|... "Little things, Rima--none so <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> chasing <b>you</b> round a tree. Only to {{have you}} stand or sit by me and talk will make me happy. And to begin you must call me by my name--Abel." ...|$|R
50|$|For levels 5-9 an {{invasion}} gate {{appears in the}} middle of x-1, in x-3 a gate appears for all those between levels 10-14 and in x-5 all players at levels 15 and above have to enter invasion here. The gate in x-1 typically contains NPCs that are easier to kill and they get <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> move to the higher gates. You are unable to log out when in the invasion gate, the only way out is if your ship is destroyed, or you level beyond the parameters of the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix, {{among them}} chaps it don't do {{to tell them}} {{too much of the}} truth. Look at that!" [...] And he brought out the sixpence again from his breeches'-pocket. [...] "And look at your reverence. Only that they've let you out for a while, they've been nigh <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> on <b>you</b> <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> were one of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want {{to watch}} that ranch," [...] he said. [...] "But I'd like one of you to ride to town as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can and take a message for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row, Tony, as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can! The launch {{has just}} passed that ship, and has changed her course. I expect the captain has called their {{attention}} to us. It's a race now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There,' said Squeers, when he {{had quite}} done; 'rub away as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like, you won't rub that off in a hurry. Oh! you won't hold that noise, won't you? Put him out, Smike.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not fond of it," [...] Jack said. [...] "I don't {{care about}} it, {{one way or}} the other. It doesn't hurt me; I am <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> nails, <b>you</b> see, so I don't think more about {{fighting}} than I do about eating my dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> are <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> iron. <b>You</b> {{have that}} {{pleasant}} outside manner {{that makes people}} think you're very gentle and yielding, but all the time you're like adamant. I would rather die than ask your forgiveness for anything, and you'd rather let me than give it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know that}} very well, Mysie, {{and this is}} a much <b>harder</b> trial, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> don't get the honour and glory of it; and, besides, you will have to take care to say not a word of this reason to Fly or Valetta, or any one else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{board at}} the bow, Mr. Glover, I will make for her quarter. Now, lay out, lads, as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, the sooner you are there the less chance you have of being hit." ...|$|E

60|$|LEVER. [Stepping up to JOY, and {{standing}} with his hands behind him-- in a low voice.] Now {{hit me in the}} face--hit me--hit me as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. Go on, Joy, it'll do you good.|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{the soda}} into the cream, {{and when it}} 'fizzles,' as Demi says, stir it into the flour, and beat it up <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>you</b> can. Have your griddle hot, butter it well, and then fry away till I come back," [...] and Aunt Jo {{vanished}} also.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hard work. Some {{doctor told}} his patient that if he'd live on half-a-crown {{a day and}} earn it, he'd soon be well.

You can't earn the half-crown a day, but <b>you</b> may work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{reverse of}} it is <b>harder</b> to understand, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> will find {{if you choose to}} take the trouble to think it out," [...] replied the missionary.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't prevent you, my dear fellow--only {{remember}} this: I {{will not}} permit you to assert, without contradicting you, that I am responsible for Clem's fortune. Now, go on, and explain away as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> like.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no reason for complaint, that way, in the future, Aggie, I promise you. But how could I tell? The last time I saw you, you were flirting, as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> could, with someone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{you must}} be careful," [...] Mr. Purfleet said, [...] "because if it should get out, the {{consequences}} might be terrible. Now, then, four of you take the sticks, and all hit together, as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can--now." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was much}} honesty {{displayed}} on this occasion. The Squire, {{when he was}} thus instigated to persevere, {{did his best to}} describe the manner in which he had been rejected. His powers of description were not very great, but he did not conceal anything wilfully. [...] "She was <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> nails, <b>you</b> know." ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the game}} starts, the player has {{a choice of}} which area to start in. The choices are: Laboratory, Garden, Sewer or Factory. There are 9 levels in each stage, each get <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go along. There are also hazards {{for each of the}} forms you change into: the rubber ball will deflate when it touches spikes, the rubber ball will burn when exposed to fire, the water drop will sink when in liquid, and the cloud can be sucked in by fans. The {{objective}} for each level is to find a cog which is hidden somewhere in the level. Once you have found all 36 cogs the uncle can fix the machine and Morph can change back to his normal form, a boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{suppose you}} would refuse me even if I were <b>hard</b> up, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call it."
