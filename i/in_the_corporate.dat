5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture.

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the early}} 2000 s <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market has {{experienced}} a significant growth. This study does, through a quantitative method, research and discuss the factors that are the main drivers of growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market {{and how they are}} related. The study focuses on the development since 2007, as the prior available data is limited. Initially, a literature review indicated that the Swedish central bank rate and the Basel Accords were the main drivers of growth. These two factors were therefore chosen as independent variables and were tested against the dependent variable, issued amount of bonds in SEK, in a number of regression analyses. The study's two propositions were; the central bank rate is a main driver for <b>the</b> growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market, and the Basel Accords are main drivers for <b>the</b> growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market. <b>The</b> first proposition, that the central bank rate is a main driver for <b>the</b> growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market, was rejected as no significance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regression analyses could be seen. The second proposition, that the Basel accords are main drivers of growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market, was supported as significance between the issuance of bonds and the Basel variables (with time lags) could be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regression analyses. As the study found support for this proposition it indicates that regulations have triggered a market development. Thus the Basel accords seem to have triggered growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Swedish <b>corporate</b> bond market...|$|R
