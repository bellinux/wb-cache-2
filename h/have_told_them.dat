500|$|Seven {{opposition}} political parties, including Al Wefaq and the National Democratic Action Society, {{issued a}} joint statement rejecting the government's charge that the demonstrators were armed and condemning [...] "the heinous massacre" [...] perpetrated by police, including the prevention of ambulances from reaching the site to ferry the wounded to hospital. They demanded {{the resignation of the}} government and the formation of a new one to investigate the [...] "crime" [...] and submit political reforms. Ibrahim Sharif, the head of National Democratic Action Society and a Sunni Muslim, said protesters were not given enough time to evacuate the area and that government could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> hours before or even by small papers thrown from helicopters. He told the BBC that [...] "throughout the day there were rumours we would have another 24 hours, but the attack has come without [...] warning." ...|$|E

2500|$|The family {{claim that}} McLaren {{was subject to}} abuse and {{bullying}} for being quiet, shy and an outsider. When he left the base in July 2011, he packed all his possessions into a his kit bag and [...] "snuck past" [...] the guards. Hours before he left, he had been seen in tears studying {{a map of the}} district. The family also said that his military friends <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he was being bullied.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{receiving}} reinforcements {{and attempting}} his assaults again, Johnson was repulsed with terrible losses {{from one end}} of his line to the other. Colonel O'Neal wrote that his brigade [...] "charged time and again up to their works but were every time compelled to retire. Many gallant men were lost." [...] The losses at Culp's Hill included approximately 2,000 men in Johnson's division, nearly a third. An additional 800 fell from the reinforcing brigades on July 3. The XII corps lost about 1,000 men over both days, including 300 men in Greene's brigade, or one fifth. Alpheus Williams summed up the futility of this fighting: [...] "The wonder is that the rebels persisted so long in an attempt that the first half hour must <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> was useless." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{operators}} had {{not been}} trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. There was a temperature indicator downstream of the pilot-operated relief valve in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer that could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the valve was stuck open, by showing that {{the temperature in the}} tail pipe remained higher than it should have been had the pilot-operated relief valve been shut. This temperature indicator, however, {{was not part of the}} [...] "safety grade" [...] suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators {{had not been}} trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight of the operators.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interim report}} was {{issued by the}} investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura. [...] In the report, the panel {{concluded}} that poor internal communication by the Japanese government and faulty knowledge and actions by TEPCO employees contributed to the disaster. [...] The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi. [...] TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor. [...] TEPCO workers turned off an emergency cooling system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993 Minnesota {{passed a}} {{provision}} that added sexual orientation to the state's human rights law. The provision has been characterized by its supporters as protecting “gay and lesbian teachers and students from discrimination”. In early 2003 Rep. Lindner claimed that the provision was a shield {{for the promotion of}} [...] homosexuality, “In some of the schools, we've got children as young as three, in pre-school, on up through the years that are being taught homosexual practices. And it doesn't mean they're going to be homosexual, but unfortunately they hear about some of the sexual activities of the homosexual, and they're being told that it's safe and so forth and healthy, and it isn't.” He claimed “parents have complained to the schools, and administrators <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that there's nothing they can do because of state law.” Lindner co-authored a bill to repeal this provision and worked to get it a hearing by a House committee. Meeting with homosexuals opposed to his bill Lindner stressed “I don't hate any of those people. I know they accuse me of hating and wanting all kind of terrible things to happen to them, but I don't hate any of them. I do love them. Actually this would benefit them if they were to leave that lifestyle or if they would maybe be more faithful to one partner, if it's got to be that way. But it's my understanding that gays have hundreds and even thousands of partners over a lifetime.” His remarks were seen as offensive by many Minnesotan homosexuals who said “most gays and lesbians are in committed relationships.” [...] They also took issue with Lindner's suggestion that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.|$|E
