50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> may be {{bacteriostatic}} or bactericidal in action, {{depending on}} the concentration of the drug attained {{at the site of}} infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. <b>Ethionamide,</b> like prothionamide and pyrazinamide, is a nicotinic acid derivative related to isoniazid. It is thought that <b>ethionamide</b> undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> {{is used in}} {{combination}} with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> has a {{high rate}} of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, {{abdominal}} pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. <b>Ethionamide</b> is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> {{can cause}} {{hepatocellular}} toxicity and is contraindicated {{in patients with}} severe liver impairment. Patients on <b>ethionamide</b> should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often {{a rise in the}} ALT and AST.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> {{frequently}} causes gastrointestinal distress with {{nausea and}} vomiting {{which can lead}} patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food.|$|E
50|$|The FDA {{has placed}} it in {{pregnancy}} category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether <b>ethionamide</b> is excreted into breast milk.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> and prothionamide are weakly {{bacteriocidal}} against M. leprae {{and can be}} used as {{alternatives to}} clofazimine in the treatment of MDR leprosy. Both cause GI intolerance and are expensive.|$|E
50|$|Both central {{neurological}} {{side effects}} such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with <b>ethionamide</b> may reduce these effects and is recommended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> is well absorbed orally with {{or without}} food, but is often {{administered}} with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma.|$|E
50|$|Expression of the ethA gene is {{controlled}} by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of <b>ethionamide</b> and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> is a prodrug {{which is}} {{activated}} by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ {{to form an}} adduct which inhibits InhA {{in the same way}} as isoniazid.

50|$|M. kubicae {{requires}} 21 days of incubation between 33°C and 37°C {{to reach}} mature growth. Isolates {{have been shown}} to be resistant to the antibiotics amikacin and rifampin and partially resistant to ciprofloxacin, cycloserine, ethambutol, isoniazid, rifabutin and streptomycin. Susceptibility to clarithromycin, clofazimine and <b>ethionamide</b> has been detected for some strains.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> was {{discovered}} in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965.

50|$|Thiocarlide has {{considerable}} antimycobacterial {{activity in}} vitro and is effective against multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoxyl inhibits M. bovis with {{six hours of}} exposure, {{which is similar to}} isoniazid and <b>ethionamide,</b> two other prominent anti-TB drugs. Unlike these two drugs, however, isoxyl also partially inhibits the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} of the {{existing}} drugs for tuberculosis were originally derived from microbes; cerulenin from the fungus Cephalosporium caerulens and thiolactomycin (TLM) from the actinomycete Nocardia spp. Isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide), <b>ethionamide,</b> triclosan 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol and TLM are known to specifically inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis. Derivatives of TLM and related compounds are being screened to improve efficacy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethionamide</b> may worsen {{the adverse}} effects of other {{antituberculous}} drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together {{and can lead to}} increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{spectrum of}} <b>ethionamide</b> includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. segmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While {{working in a}} similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{efforts in}} {{integrating}} nanotechnology and biological research {{have been successful}} and show much promise for the future. Since nanoparticles are a potential vehicle of drug delivery, the biological responses of cells to these nanoparticles are continuously being explored to optimize their efficacy and how their design could be improved. Pyrgiotakis et al. were able to study the interaction between CeO2 and Fe2O3 engineered nanoparticles and cells by attaching the engineered nanoparticles to the AFM tip. Beyond the interactions with external synthetic materials, cells have been imaged with X-ray crystallography {{and there has been}} much curiosity about their behavior in vivo. Studies have taken advantage of AFM to obtain further information on the behavior of live cells in biological media. Real-time atomic force spectroscopy (or nanoscopy) and dynamic atomic force spectroscopy have been used to study live cells and membrane proteins and their dynamic behavior at high resolution, on the nanoscale. Imaging and obtaining information on the topography and the properties of the cells has also given insight into chemical processes and mechanisms that occur through cell-cell interaction and interactions with other signaling molecules (ex. ligands). Evans and Calderwood used single cell force microscopy to study cell adhesion forces, bond kinetics/dynamic bond strength and its role in chemical processes such as cell signaling. Scheuring, Lévy, and Rigaud reviewed studies in which AFM to explore the crystal structure of membrane proteins of photosynthetic bacteria.Alsteen et al. have used AFM-based nanoscopy to perform a real-time analysis of the interaction between live mycobacteria and antimycobacterial drugs (specifically isoniazid, <b>ethionamide,</b> ethambutol, and streptomycine), which serves {{as an example of the}} more in-depth analysis of pathogen-drug interactions that can be done through AFM.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Ethionamide</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used drugs for the {{treatment}} of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Like isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, <b>ethionamide</b> is a prodrug that needs to be activated by a mycobacterial enzyme. Activation pathways of prodrugs are generally problematic to uncover as they produce intermediates potentially difficult to characterize, to purify and that might prove unstable outside of their cellular context. Objectives and methods: We have used high resolution magic angle spinning-NMR (HRMAS-NMR) to follow <b>ethionamide</b> activation directly within living mycobacterial cells. RESULTS: Data indicated that the intracellular metabolization of <b>ethionamide</b> strictly depends on the presence of the monooxygenase EthA and that EthA-dependent activation of <b>ethionamide</b> is coupled to a precise molecular sorting mechanism of the <b>ethionamide</b> metabolites. We found that the previously identified <b>ethionamide</b> metabolite 2 -ethyl- 4 -hydroxymethylpyridine is produced in substantial amounts by the ethionamide-treated mycobacteria and that it is present exclusively outside of the bacteria. In contrast, the still unidentified <b>ethionamide</b> metabolite ETH* is the only <b>ethionamide</b> derivative detected within the bacterial cell. Moreover, ETH* appears to be unable to cross the bacterial envelope and consequently accumulates within the cytoplasm of the ethionamide-treated mycobacteria.

40|$|Objective: <b>Ethionamide</b> being {{thermolabile}} in nature, {{effect of}} temperature {{on the drug}} and its stability in liquid andsolid media during susceptibility testing procedures was assessed to understand the inconsistency in DST formats. Methods: Working solution of <b>ethionamide</b> and Lowenstein- Jensen (LJ) media incorporated with <b>ethionamide</b> werepreincubated at 4 °C and 37 °C prior to DST methods was incubated till 4 weeks at different temperatures and utilizedfor DST in MGIT 960. Results: Degradation of <b>ethionamide</b> working solution was observed at 37 °C after 3 weeks of incubation.

40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and specific fluorimetric method {{was developed for}} the determination of carbocisteine and <b>ethionamide</b> in their dosage forms. The proposed method based on the reaction of carbocisteine and <b>ethionamide</b> with roth's reagent (o-phthaldehyde) to get a highly fluorescent isoindole product emits strong fluorescence at 431 nm and 424 nm after excitation at 329 nm and 339 nm for carbocisteine and <b>ethionamide,</b> respectively.

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} diseases in Pakistan. Pakistan has the highest burden of MDR-TB in the Eastern Mediterranean region. <b>Ethionamide</b> is an anti-tuberculous drug frequently used to treat MDR-TB. Its drug susceptibility testing is not easily available in resource limited settings. Since it acts on the same target protein as isoniazid (inhA protein encoded by inhA gene), we sought to find out if phenotypic isoniazid resistance can be a marker of <b>ethionamide</b> resistance. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at the Aga Khan University hospital section of microbiology. Data was retrieved between 2011 to 2014 for all culture positive MTB strains. All culture positive MTB isolates with susceptibilities to isoniazid and <b>ethionamide</b> recorded were included in the study. Isoniazid and <b>ethionamide</b> susceptibilities were performed using agar proportion method on Middlebrook 7 H 10 agar. Rate of <b>Ethionamide</b> resistance between low-level isoniazid resistant, high level isoniazid resistant and isoniazid sensitive MTB was compared. Results: A total of 11, 274 isolates were included in the study. A statistically significant association (P < 0. 001) was found between <b>Ethionamide</b> resistance and low-level isoniazid resistance (26. 6 %) as compared to high-level isoniazid resistance (8. 85 %) and isoniazid sensitivity (0. 71 %) in MTB strains. However this association was not seen in XDR-TB strains. Conclusion: Low level isoniazid resistance may be used as marker for phenotypic <b>ethionamide</b> resistance and hence guide clinicians' choice of antituberculous agent for MDR-TB in Pakistan. Further studies involving detection of genotypic association of isoniazid and <b>ethionamide</b> susceptibilities are needed before a final conclusion can be derived...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The use of <b>ethionamide</b> {{has been}} {{increasing}} in drug regiments due to greater incidence of multidrug resistance tuberculosis around the world. <b>Ethionamide</b> is metabolized into antimicrobial relevant compounds by different flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes including FMO 1, FMO 2, and FMO 3. FMOs are found in various locations in the body including the intestine, kidney, liver, and lung. In humans, active functional FMO 2 * 1 is found in approximately 50 % of Sub-Saharan Africans and a truncated, inactive FMO 2 * 2, is found in all Caucasians and Asians. Polymorphisms in human FMO 2 were investigated by comparing differences in metabolism of <b>ethionamide</b> in wildtype mice relative to Fmo 1 / 2 / 4 null mice. All mice were capable of metabolizing <b>ethionamide</b> into <b>ethionamide</b> S-oxide and 2 -ethyl- 4 -amidopyridine. Wildtype mice had higher plasma levels of metabolites than parent compound. In contrast, Fmo 1 / 2 / 4 null mice had higher plasma levels of parent compound than metabolites. In both mouse populations, maximum <b>ethionamide</b> concentration peaked at 2 hours post-exposure. Increased metabolism of <b>ethionamide</b> in wildtype mice may deplete glutathione pools and induce oxidative stress leading to greater toxicity and adverse drug effects. This murine model is used to demonstrate the polymorphic differences of FMO 2 occurring in humans. Taking these differences into account, polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes {{provide a basis for}} increasing specific and individualized drug treatment regiments in susceptible populations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ethionamide,</b> 250 mg every 12 h for a {{total of}} nine doses, was {{administered}} to 40 adult volunteers (10 men with AIDS, 10 healthy men, 10 women with AIDS, and 10 healthy women). Blood was obtained for drug assay prior to administration of the first dose, 2 h after the last dose, and at the completion of standardized bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage, which were performed 4 h after the last dose. <b>Ethionamide</b> was measured in epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar cells (AC) using a new mass spectrometric method. The presence of AIDS or gender was without significant effect on the concentrations of <b>ethionamide</b> in plasma, AC, or ELF. Plasma concentrations (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) were 0. 97 ± 0. 65 and 0. 65 ± 0. 35 μg/ml at 2 and 4 h after the last dose, respectively, and both values were significantly greater than the concentration of <b>ethionamide</b> in AC (0. 38 ± 0. 47 μg/ml) (P < 0. 05). The concentration of <b>ethionamide</b> was significantly greater in ELF (5. 63 ± 3. 8 μg/ml) than in AC or plasma at 2 and 4 h and was approximately 10 to 20 times the reported MIC for ethionamide-susceptible strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For all 40 subjects, the ELF/plasma concentration ratios (mean ± SD) at 2 and 4 h were 8. 7 ± 11. 7 and 9. 7 ± 5. 6, respectively. We conclude that the absorption of orally administered <b>ethionamide,</b> as measured in this study, was not affected by gender or the presence of AIDS. <b>Ethionamide</b> concentrations were significantly greater in ELF than in plasma or AC, suggesting that substantial antimycobacterial activity resides in this compartment...|$|E

40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains the}} world’s deadliest {{communicable}} bacterial disease with an unacceptably high death rate. In 2013 an estimated 1. 5 million people {{died as a}} direct result of TB, and nine million new cases were reported. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis cases are on the rise and without novel approaches to combat their spread, tuberculosis will continue to claim the lives of millions worldwide. One such novel approach is to rejuvenate the use of the second-line antibiotic <b>ethionamide.</b> <b>Ethionamide</b> is a structural analogue of the first-line pro-drug isoniazid, which is used widely and to which there is growing resistance. <b>Ethionamide</b> was introduced in the 1960 s and primarily used in cases of drug-resistant TB due to its severe adverse effects. This makes <b>ethionamide</b> an exploitable target for small-molecule booster drugs. Expression of the enzyme responsible for <b>ethionamide</b> activation, EthA, is regulated by a transcriptional repressor EthR which can be inhibited to improve <b>ethionamide</b> activation and so reduce <b>ethionamide</b> treatment doses and bring an old drug new life in the clinic. EthR inhibitors are currently in development; here, chemoinformatic pipelining and virtual screening in GOLD were used to identify hits with novel scaffolds for hit-to-lead efforts from an initial library of over six million drug-like molecules. Thermal shift assays were used to identify EthR-binding molecules and SPR was utilised to confirm and potentially quantify binding affinities. Herein are reported the co-crystal structures of several hit molecules, used to confirm and characterise the EthR-ligand complexes. Through the application of computational, biophysical and crystallographic methods, this thesis presents several novel scaffolds for development against EthR. These novel hits will be developed to expand our arsenal against the growing, global problem of drug-resistant TB. ...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous mutants of Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{that were}} {{resistant to the}} anti-tuberculosis drugs <b>ethionamide</b> and isoniazid were isolated and found to map to mshA, a gene encoding the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of mycothiol, a major low-molecular-weight thiol in M. tuberculosis. Seven independent missense or frameshift mutations within mshA were identified and characterized. Precise null deletion mutations of the mshA gene were generated by specialized transduction in three different strains of M. tuberculosis. The mshA deletion mutants were defective in mycothiol biosynthesis, were only ethionamide-resistant and required catalase to grow. Biochemical studies suggested that the mechanism of <b>ethionamide</b> resistance in mshA mutants was likely due to a defect in <b>ethionamide</b> activation. In vivo, a mycothiol-deficient strain grew normally in immunodeficient mice, but was slightly defective for growth in immunocompetent mice.
