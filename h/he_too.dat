5|$|While {{defending}} the Oosterbeek perimeter three {{days into the}} battle, Baskeyfield commanded a pair of anti-tank guns that destroyed several enemy tanks before the crews were killed. Baskeyfield subsequently fired the guns alone before <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was killed. His body was not identified {{after the war and}} he has no known grave.|$|E
5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but <b>he,</b> <b>too,</b> was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian {{gathered}} many rebels in Nubia, but <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause {{and that of his}} dynastic predecessors.|$|E

He had been friends with Mitsuru since middle school and upon learning of the Shadows, <b>he</b> <b>too</b> awakened {{to the power of}} Persona and joined her cause. Belonging to the boxing team at Gekkoukan High, Akihiko is constantly training to become a stronger fighter. His Persona is Polydeuces. Midorikawa noted that the Persona summoning scenes were his favorite. Midorikawa's co-cast members from the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga video game were also featured for the supporting cast of the film.|$|E
5|$|Carry {{leaves the}} home that Fenwick has found her and wanders distraught. Eventually, {{she returns to}} the mill, half {{resolved}} to see her old home and then drown herself in the millstream. There she is greeted lovingly by her mother and sister. Her father reluctantly allows her {{to remain in the}} family home; eventually <b>he</b> <b>too</b> forgives her, although he can never forget the shame she has brought on the family. Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, but although she has returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband.|$|E
5|$|Cecil Roland McKenzie {{was a young}} {{electrical}} engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. <b>He</b> <b>too</b> was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Years Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a wireless room in the attic. The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.|$|E

5|$|Dein in the {{meantime}} pursued an offer from a television consortium, funded by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the Astra satellite transponder. The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was impressed, SBC's offer eventually failed because of sponsorship doubts.|$|E
5|$|For 1943 and 1944, Clarence Spears was the Maryland head coach. Like Shaughnessy, Spears {{had taken}} an underachieving team and turned them around. In 1925, he took over Minnesota, which had posted a 3–3–2 record the prior season, and led them to {{a share of the}} 1927 Big Ten championship. However, at Maryland, when Spears {{accumulated}} a record of 5–12–1 after two seasons, <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was replaced.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, John, {{inherited}} the castle in 1780, {{but when his}} son, also called John, inherited in 1816 he chose to live in London instead, opening up Dunster Castle to the public. By 1845 the castle appeared to visitors to be past its prime: with only two of John's sisters living there and no horses or hunting dogs left in the castle grounds, the remaining servants had little to do. John's brother Henry inherited in 1857, but <b>he</b> <b>too</b> lived in London rather than at Dunster.|$|E
50|$|I hate Valentino! All men hate Valentino. I hate his oriental optics; I hate {{his classic}} nose; I hate his Roman face; I hate his smile; I hate his glistening teeth; I hate his patent leather hair; I hate his Svengali glare; I hate him because <b>he</b> dances <b>too</b> well; I hate him because he's a slicker; I hate him because he's the great lover of the screen; I hate him because he's an embezzeler of hearts; I hate him because <b>he's</b> <b>too</b> apt {{in the art}} of osculation; I hate him because he's leading man for Gloria Swanson; I hate him because <b>he's</b> <b>too</b> good looking.|$|R

5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though <b>he</b> <b>too</b> started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the chronicles {{of earlier}} {{travelling}} naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin and especially William Henry Edwards, Wallace decided that <b>he</b> <b>too</b> wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief. Their {{intention was to}} collect insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon Rainforest for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species.|$|E
5|$|Kip {{manages to}} learn the code but is {{seemingly}} too late. Planet B shuts down, with the virtual world slowly being destroyed. However, they discover the reset button and attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that <b>he</b> <b>too</b> is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button is pressed, resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E

5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|Neither of the qaghans {{were able}} to {{successfully}} exert control. Turkic tribes resisted Yuanqing's rule, defeating the qaghan and forcing Yuanqing to return to Chang'an. Kusrau {{was able to bring}} the western tribes temporarily under his rule, but was defeated in 690 during an invasion by the Second Turkic Khaganate, and <b>he</b> <b>too</b> was forced to escape the region with his loyalists. Later attempts to install puppet qaghans failed, and the title was reduced to a symbolic position in the Tang court.|$|E
5|$|Nikumbh returns, and {{subsequently}} {{brings up the}} topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that <b>he</b> <b>too</b> is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using remedial techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.|$|E
