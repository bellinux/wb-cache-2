25|$|The by-laws were an {{important}} element {{in the evolution of the}} shophouse building form.

25|$|Plates from Delaporte's drawings, {{in which}} certain features—ruins, wild animals and {{enormous}} trees—are exaggerated {{in order to}} match and satisfy 19th century European tastes for the romantic helped to keep the commission in the public's mind.

25|$|Ibn Sīnā wrote {{extensively}} on early Islamic philosophy, especially the subjects logic, ethics, and metaphysics, including treatises named Logic and Metaphysics. Most {{of his works}} were written in Arabic–then the language of science in the Middle East– and some in Persian. Of linguistic significance <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate {{in the spirit of}} ijtihad.|$|E
25|$|The club strip {{was changed}} again in 1901, Genoa adopted its famous red-navy halves and {{therefore}} {{became known as}} the rossoblu; these are the colours used <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day as many other Italian club do as Cagliari, Bologna and an endless list of minor clubs. After a season of finishing runners-up to Milan Cricket and Football Club, things were back on track in 1902 with their fourth title. Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa's throne from 1903 onwards, when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat the Old Lady in the national final.|$|E

25|$|The {{loss of the}} orange's {{competitiveness}} in the Azores (due to falling {{prices in}} England) and the concordant appearance of citrus diseases, forced {{the end of the}} lucrative business, causing most orchards to begin cultivating other fruits, sawmilling or reverting to the production of low-grade vineyards for public consumption. By the middle of the 19th century, the orange business had almost completely disappeared. The appearance of a chestnut industry then influenced the economy of Terra Chã, with the cultivation of extensive pasturelands with Viana Chestnut, which transformed itself into an emblem of the region, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E
25|$|Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to exhibit Déjeuner sur l'herbe and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés. Déjeuner sur l'herbe depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day. Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past.|$|E
25|$|Russian was {{the most}} {{commonly}} studied foreign language {{at all levels of}} schooling during the Soviet era. Despite schooling available and administration conducted in local languages, Russian settlers were neither encouraged nor motivated to learn the official local languages, so knowledge of Russian became a practical necessity in daily life. <b>Even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, {{the majority of the population}} of the Baltic states profess to be proficient in Russian, especially those who lived during Soviet rule. Meanwhile, the minority of Russian origin generally do not speak the national language. The question of their assimilation is a major factor in social and diplomatic affairs.|$|E

25|$|A {{wall was}} soon erected around Ommen, {{including}} three gates: the Vechtpoort or Voorbruggenpoort (on {{the bank of}} the Vecht), the Varsenerpoort (on the western wall for traffic with Varsen) and the Arriërpoort (on the northern wall for traffic with Arriën). <b>Even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, the two bells in the church's belltower, named Maria and Salvator and cast in 1517 by Hendrick de Tremonia of Dordrecht, are rung every evening at nine o'clock. These so-called Ave-Maria peals form a custom which traces its origin to the tradition of ringing the bell at the closing of the gates. Ommen never received a moat, even though it was permitted one.|$|E
25|$|The madaris rose as {{colleges of}} {{learning}} in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier. They catered {{not only to the}} religious establishment, though that was the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one. To the latter they supplied physicians, administrative officials, judges and teachers. <b>Even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day many Registered madaris are Working effectively and coping up with Modern Education System such as Jamia-tul-Madina which is a chain of Islamic schools in Pakistan and in European and other countries established by Dawat-e-Islami. The Jamia-tul-Madina are also known as Faizan-e-Madina. Dawat-e-Islami has grown its network of Madaris from Pakistan to Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Clan Ranald {{is one of}} {{the most}} tragic and unique shipwrecks in Australian waters. It {{represents}} one of the worst shipwrecks in Australian history with a massive loss of life. Combined with the grave sites of the officers and the crew in the nearby Edithburgh Cemetery, the Clan Ranald is a somber reminder of a huge tragedy. For this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, not only because of the disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. <b>Even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, if you visit the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E

60|$|That {{her husband}} should be bewildered by the curious {{misunderstanding}} which {{had taken place}} and also permanently grieved by her disloyalty to his respectable ideals was only natural. He was, however, perfectly satisfied with her beauty, her brilliance, and her useful connections. She was admired, she was envied; she was surrounded by splendour and adulation; the days went on rapid, brilliant, uniform, without a glimpse of sincerity or true passion, without a single true emotion--not even that of a great sorrow. And swiftly and stealthily they had led her on and on, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> coast, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> sea, <b>to</b> <b>this</b> moment of time and <b>to</b> <b>this</b> spot on the earth's surface where she felt unerringly that the moving shadow of the unbroken night had stood still to remain with her forever.|$|R

25|$|Pullen often {{polarized}} {{critics and}} suffered from two undeserved allegations: the first (despite his grounding {{in the church}} and blues) that he was purely a free jazz player and thus unemployable in any other context; the second that he had been heavily influenced by Cecil Taylor or was a clone of Taylor, to whose playing Pullen's own bore a superficial resemblance. Pullen strenuously denied that he had any link with Taylor, stating that his own style had been developed in isolation before he ever heard of Taylor. But the assertion of Taylor's influence continued to haunt Pullen to the end of Pullen's life, and persists <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day.|$|E
25|$|When {{morning was}} come {{they set up}} an eagle at the eastern gate, and {{erecting}} an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and the bodily characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and {{in the hierarchy of}} their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.|$|E
25|$|Hungary elected Leopold as its king in 1655, with Bohemia and Croatia {{following}} suit in 1656 and 1657 respectively. In July 1658, {{more than}} a year after his father's death, Leopold was elected Emperor at Frankfurt in spite of the French minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who sought to put the Imperial Crown on the head of Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria, or some other non-Habsburg prince. To conciliate France, which had considerable influence in German affairs thanks to the League of the Rhine, the newly elected Emperor promised not to assist Spain, then at war with France. This marked the beginning of a nearly 47-year career filled with rivalry with France and its king, Louis XIV. The latter's dominant personality and power completely overshadowed Leopold, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> day, but though Leopold did not lead his troops in person as Louis XIV did, he was no less a warrior-king given the greater part of his public life was directed towards the arrangement and prosecution of wars.|$|E
25|$|Piccolomini {{was elected}} by accessus on the second scrutiny, taking the name Pius III after his uncle Pius II. The sixty-four-year-old Piccolomini was too ill <b>even</b> <b>to</b> attend <b>this</b> scrutiny. Since {{he was only a}} deacon, Piccolomini was ordained a bishop by della Rovere, only to die on October 18.|$|R
