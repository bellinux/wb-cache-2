5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E
5|$|M. N. Rajam {{was cast}} as Manohari, {{the queen of}} Ratnapuri, and king Marthandan's wife. Ramachandran wanted Rajam for the role to avoid her being typecast as a {{character}} driven by jealousy and malice. For the role of Ratna, B. Saroja Devi was selected after a successful audition. Saroja Devi was not fluent in Tamil at the time, so her dialogues were written {{in such a way}} that she would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to pronounce them. P. S. Veerappa, M. N. Nambiar and Chakrapani played the antagonists Vijayavarman, Pingalan and Karmegam. T. K. Balachandran, who was prominent in Malayalam films, was cast as Bhupathi. K. R. Ramsingh was selected for the role of Madhana and Bhupathi's father, Veerabahu, after Ramachandran was impressed by his performance in one of the stage plays he featured in. J. P. Chandrababu played Veerangan's friend and sidekick, Sagayam. T. P. Muthulakshmi was cast as Nagamma, a native of Kanni Theevu, who wants a husband. G. Sakunthala played Manohari's lady-in-waiting Nandini and K. S. Angamuthu the restaurateur Pappa respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{anonymous}} {{nature of}} the internet may be a factor of encouraging anti-social behavior. This type of behavior expands {{to other parts of}} the internet separate from gaming, such as online forums, social media sites, etc. Lack of accountability for one's actions on the internet may encourage others to engage in harassing behavior. Without minimal threat of punishment, some may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to carry out negative behavior over online gaming.|$|E

25|$|Three {{researchers}} {{who wrote about}} psychological life on kibbutzim were Melford E. Spiro (1958), Bruno Bettelheim (1969) and Michael Baizerman (1963). All concluded that a kibbutz upbringing led to individuals' having greater difficulty in making strong emotional commitments thereafter, such as falling in love or forming a lasting friendship. On the other hand, they appear to <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to have {{a large number of}} less-involved friendships, and a more active social life.|$|E

25|$|Inhibitory control, often {{conceptualized}} {{as an executive}} function, {{is the ability to}} inhibit or hold back a prepotent response. It is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response; impulsive people may find it more difficult to inhibit action whereas non-impulsive people may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to do so. There is evidence that, in normal adults, commonly used behavioral measures of inhibitory control correlate with standard self-report measures of impulsivity.|$|E
25|$|Families do {{not always}} immigrate as one unit. Given the various legal and {{economical}} factors associated with transnational migration, certain family members may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to immigrate to the United States than others. In other cases, individuals may immigrate to the United States as an employment strategy, with no intention of permanently relocating their family to the U.S. The distribution of family members across national borders can generate unique forms of inequality within the families of immigrants.|$|E

The ITQ system in New Zealand is complex system, and where fish are landed by a fisherman without quota for a particular species, they {{have the option to}} buy quota from another fisherman, or the value of the overrun catch be surrendered to the state. In many cases the fishermen <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to discard the fish at sea than go through the complex system of landing the fish and then making it legal.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> than children {{to comprehend the}} sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate {{the ways in which}} language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and sarcasm. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.) This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.|$|E

By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and people will have an easier time referring to the storm after it occurs. Most independent sources identify the use of winter storm names by The Weather Channel as a form of SEO-friendly branding.|$|E
25|$|Messengers carry a huge {{variety of}} items, from {{things that could}} not be sent by digital means (corporate gifts, {{original}} artwork, clothes for photo-shoots, original signed documents) to mundane items that could easily be emailed, albeit without the air of importance attached to an express courier delivery. Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle. Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography.|$|E

25|$|Although all {{broadcast}} networks in Canada {{are required to}} produce and air some Canadian content, only the English and French networks of the CBC run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules. (The English network does run some imported programming, such as Coronation Street and Grand Designs) Both CTV and Global have at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. Both networks often <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes Francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Since the cricket bat is {{wide and}} flat, while the {{baseball}} bat is narrow and round, {{on the whole}} cricket batsmen <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to hit and direct the ball than baseball batters, resulting in many more runs being scored in a cricket match. While bowlers can influence {{the ability of the}} batsmen to do so, perhaps the most famous episode being the Bodyline tactic, cricket batsmen can use a wider variety of batting strokes to direct the ball in many directions into a field which provides much more open space than in baseball. Keeping in mind, cricket batsmen are under no obligation to attempt to score a run after any stroke, but must strike balls to prevent them from hitting the wicket. Many strokes are in fact defensive in nature against a well-bowled ball and the quality of defensive batting is often the determining factor of a batsman's success over his career, especially in the longer forms of the game.|$|E
