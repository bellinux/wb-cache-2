5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more <b>exposed</b> areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly <b>exposed</b> positions, such as on <b>exposed</b> coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily when <b>exposed</b> to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is <b>exposed</b> to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an <b>exposed</b> hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an <b>exposed</b> phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the <b>exposed</b> 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now <b>exposed</b> in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not <b>exposed</b> in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was <b>exposed</b> to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} oldest <b>exposed</b> rocks in the area due to {{extensive}} metamorphism (alteration of rock by heat and pressure). Radiometric dating gives an age of 1,700million years for the metamorphism during the Proterozoic. About 1,400million years ago a mass of granite now in the Panamint Range intruded this complex. Uplift later <b>exposed</b> these rocks to nearly 500million years of erosion.|$|E
5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the <b>exposed</b> dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the <b>exposed</b> dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} provides {{methods of}} preparing functionalized graphene nanoribbons. Such methods include: (1) <b>exposing</b> {{a plurality of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to an alkali metal source {{in the presence of}} an aprotic solvent to open them; and (2) <b>exposing</b> the opened CNTs to an electrophile to form functionalized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). The methods may also include a step of <b>exposing</b> the opened CNTs to a protic solvent to quench any reactive species on them. Additional methods include preparing unfunctionalized GNRs by: (1) <b>exposing</b> a plurality of CNTs to an alkali metal source in the presence of an aprotic solvent to open them; and (2) <b>exposing</b> the opened CNTs to a protic solvent to form unfunctionalized GNRs...|$|R
50|$|Isomorphic {{keyboards}} <b>expose</b> the invariant {{properties of}} the meantone tunings of the syntonic temperament isomorphically (that is, for example, by <b>exposing</b> a given interval with a single consistent inter-button shape in every octave, key, and tuning) because both the isomorphic keyboard and temperament are two-dimensional (i.e., rank-2) entities (Milne, 2007). One-dimensional N-key keyboards can <b>expose</b> accurately the invariant properties of only a single one-dimensional N-ET tuning; hence, the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, with 12 keys per octave, can <b>expose</b> the invariant properties of only one tuning: 12-ET.|$|R
5000|$|Scot Sothern (born 1949) is an American {{photographer}} and writer {{best known for}} his controversial black and white photographs of prostitutes of Southern California, whom he photographed from 1986 to 1990. Sothern says the photographs are <b>exposés,</b> but they don't just <b>expose</b> the women in them, they <b>expose</b> the artist behind the camera. [...] "They show that I am who they are." ...|$|R
5|$|The Grand Staircase is {{an immense}} {{sequence}} of sedimentary rock layers that stretch south from Bryce Canyon National Park through Zion National Park {{and into the}} Grand Canyon. Within this sequence, the oldest <b>exposed</b> formation in the Zion and Kolob canyons area is the youngest <b>exposed</b> formation in the Grand Canyonthe Kaibab limestone. Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting Cenozoic-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest <b>exposed</b> formation in Bryce Canyonthe Dakota Sandstone.|$|E

5|$|The {{formations}} <b>exposed</b> in {{the area}} of the park are part of the Grand Staircase. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are <b>exposed</b> in the Grand Canyon, the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.|$|E

[241] It may he asked, how for it {{is right}} to <b>expose</b> {{ourselves}} to danger and difficulties, since it is rashness, not courage, to <b>expose</b> ourselves to unnecessary danger, or to give unnecessary offence.

5|$|The {{government}} of Vietnam says that 4 {{million of its}} citizens were <b>exposed</b> to Agent Orange, {{and as many as}} 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include their children who were <b>exposed.</b> The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated Agent Orange. The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, {{our study}} implies {{the need of}} {{understanding}} vlog {{as a form of}} marketing mix that fashion retailers can utilize. This study reveals that <b>exposing</b> fashion products in the vlog has a positive effect on the attitude toward product and the purchase intention, so that we suggest that fashion retailers need to <b>expose</b> their products in the vlog. In particular, it is necessary to use vlog appropriately as marketing tools, paying attention to the high recognition of all attributes (attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness) of information sources when vlogger <b>exposes</b> the products implicitly rather than <b>exposes</b> explicitly.|$|R

5|$|Up to {{four million}} people in Vietnam were <b>exposed</b> to the defoliant, with around one million now {{suffering}} serious health issues. The chemical is capable of damaging genes, resulting in deformities among the offspring of <b>exposed</b> victims. The U.S. government has documented higher cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in <b>exposed</b> veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E
5|$|Upturned {{beds are}} <b>exposed</b> in {{sections}} of the folded Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, including exposures on the flanks and axis of the Broad Top Synclinorium in south central Pennsylvania. <b>Exposed</b> beds are nearly horizontal on the Allegheny Plateau, but upturned to form slightly overturned beds found along the Allegheny Front.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert.
