40|$|International audience'Coping with instability' was {{certainly}} one of the main ground {{for the development of the}} " friendly societies " (England), the " sociétés de charité " (France) or the private insurance during the nineteenth century in Europe, as numerous forms of social and economic organization addressing the poor to collect and save money for burials (Trompette & Griffith, 2011). One and half a century later, private <b>death</b> <b>insurance</b> has emerged relatively unexpectedly in France, with the formation of an 'ad-hoc market' built on the alliance between insurance companies and funeral companies. How are we to assess this modern system of funeral contract, particularly compared with the historical forms which prevailed previously? What do it says about the social way fellow citizens pay tribute to their dead? This paper examines the funeral insurance contract as a socio-technical market device (Callon, Millo, & Muniesa, 2007; MacKenzie & Hardie, 2006; McFall, 2008), considering the various operations it contains: a valuation formula, incorporating a economic calculation (saving plan, capitalization contract) and a social valuation (the tribute to the dead); an attachment formula, with the formalization of an economic and juridical connection between heterogeneous actors - the ex-post dead, its family, an insurance company, a funeral parlour (Callon & Law, 2003; Vatin, 2009). Prolonging the hypothesis according to which markets are always linked to moralisations (even if more or less explicit) (Fourcade & Kieran, 2007), it shows to what extent these different type of <b>death</b> <b>insurance</b> carry a moral mandate and build up a solidarity in the way modern societies deal with their dead...|$|E

40|$|Life {{insurance}} {{is one of}} the most heavily regulated businesses in the United States economy. Because of the industry’s importance to American families, to our economy, and to our tax system, policy decisions that affect life insurance products receive a great deal of scrutiny. That scrutiny is likely to increase in the wake of recent insolvencies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for evaluating tax and regulatory policies in the life insurance market. Life Insurance Products Life insurance companies are in the business of providing risk coverage and investing the customer’s savings. Traditionally, they offer insurance against three kinds of risk: (1) Insurance against early death, which by analogy to insurance against fire should have been called <b>death</b> <b>insurance,</b> but in a masterstroke of salesmanship was called life insurance; (2) Insurance against living too long, provided by life annuities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, {{the market in}} private <b>death</b> <b>insurance</b> (pre-paid funeral plans) has {{developped}} relatively suddenly in France, {{as has been the}} case in other Western countries (UK, US, Australia in recent decades). This paper analyses the concrete fabric of the agencements by the various stakeholders operating in this new market. The study focuses on the "pre-paid contract" as the key market device which governs contractual arrangements and essential problems of coordination (Beckert, 2009) : value formation (price, payment, capitalization), regulation of competition (the terms of agreement between the co-contractors), organisation of cooperation (the division of labour and tasks between the insurance company and the funeral operator). By observing the competition in supply, and the subsequent competitive alliances formed between the key economic actors, it examines the specific properties of the various pre-paid contracts and particularly {{the way in which they}} fix the links and interdependencies between the market protagonists...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{draws upon}} {{the history of}} the funeral market over two centuries to examine three major devices which have {{played a central role in}} the funeral economy, both in terms of {{defining}} the nature of the 'goods' and their attendant value but also in regulating the relations between the Pompes Fune'bres and the other institutional actors involved. It highlights the ways in which these devices provide a 'politics of value' performing the articulation between the formatting of economic value and the pursuit of political concerns. First, observing the constitutional phase of the private industry, it examines the 'system of the classes' as a central device of managing dissonance between conflicting interests. Then, a historical jump leads us to half way through the twentieth century to the market infrastructure formed by the management of 'care for the deceased'. As a third point, the exponential development of <b>death</b> <b>insurance</b> in recent years appears as an expression of rationalization of funeral arrangement. The analysis of the market devices will highlight an essential property, that is, the incorporation of a 'calculation formula' which set up both the profit sharing and the handling of moral and political issues...|$|E
