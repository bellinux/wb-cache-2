Krahbichler theorized that the video, which he deemed [...] "very political", might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> related to the election. He also felt that the date that Wright posted the video on his Facebook page could be a reference to Guy Fawkes' words [...] "Remember, remember, the 5th of November".|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} before Payá's death, his {{influence}} {{was said to be}} waning, and attention shifted to younger activists such as blogger Yoani Sanchez. In 2010, WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department cables from Jonathan D. Farrar, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, describing Payá and other older dissidents as [...] "hopelessly out of touch", writing, [...] "They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> that is getting out, it does not appeal to that segment of society." [...] However, many of the younger generation of dissidents cited him as a role model and expressed grief at his death.|$|E

It's also heavy-handed. I do like that they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to go with the jokes, {{but it would have been}} more effective if it were more subtle." [...] Josh Rode of DVD Verdict described the episode as [...] "decent". Shannon Gosney of The Mommy-Files said [...] "there were many parts where my boys just burst out laughing.

As surgeons are working on wounded soldiers, Radar enters, visibly shaken and not wearing the required surgical mask. Trapper chides him for this, but Radar, too dazed to react (or care), delivers a shocking announcement (and quite possibly his most famous line): [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message.</b> Lieutenant Colonel... Henry Blake's plane... was shot down... over the Sea of Japan. It spun in... there were no survivors." [...] Radar leaves the O.R. as the camera pans the stunned and silent hospital staff, including Trapper and a teary-eyed Hawkeye, who continue to operate on the wounded, and even Majors Burns and Houlihan, who are crying.|$|E

500|$|His {{popularity}} has {{been attributed to}} [...] "his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life. Almost every film of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> or even warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even be taken in a comical way, but do not fail {{to create a sense of}} entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him.|$|E

[...] "We felt like charting all that and showing the differences and showing people making terrible mistakes ruining their lives and then realizing it and trying to push back when everything is crumbling – without getting into soap opera.

In December 2004, the Washington Post summarized Goeglein's job as [...] "to make sure conservatives are happy, in the loop and getting their best ideas before the president and turned into laws." [...] Writing in the New York Times, reporter David D. Kirkpatrick described him as [...] "Mr. Rove's legman on the right". Edwin Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation, said in June 2004 that he and Goeglein saw each other {{two or three times}} a week, and [...] "If I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> I want to get to Rove or the administration, I will scribble out a note to Tim, and within 24 hours I will get a response back.

2500|$|When SMAP's {{production}} team asked Yamaguchi {{to create the}} song, {{he did not know}} if the song {{was going to be a}} single or an album song as [...] "Magic Time" [...] had been. Yamaguchi created the song after listening to SMAP's previous singles, attempting to create a medium tempo song that could express the fire in someone's heart. Yamaguchi felt that writing the song had been a learning process for him, as he needed to consider what type of pop music would suit the band and the song from a different perspective to how he wrote pop music for his band Sakanaction. The song's lyrics <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> of encouragement for Olympic athletes. The song is a pop song build on top of fast tempo drums and synthesized string sounds. CDJournal reviewers felt that the song was [...] "overflowing" [...] with a fast pace, feeling it lyrically emphasized the importance of now.|$|E

State senators said that this congressional race affected the New York State Senate's December 2, 2009 vote against same-sex marriage legislation; all 30 Republican state senators voted [...] "no". [...] Following her unsuccessful campaign, Scozzafava acknowledged that her name had begun {{being used as a}} verb: [...] "scozzafavaed".

2500|$|The comic poet, Aristophanes, is the {{earliest}} known critic to characterize Euripides as a spokesman for destructive, new ideas, associated with declining standards in both society and tragedy (see Reception for more). However, 5th century tragedy was a social gathering for [...] "carrying out quite publicly the maintenance and development of mental infrastructure" [...] and it offered spectators a [...] "platform for an utterly unique form of institutionalized discussion". A dramatist's role was not just to entertain but also to educate his fellow citizenshe was expected to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>message.</b> Traditional myth provided the subject matter but the dramatist {{was meant to be}} innovative so as to sustain interest, which led to novel characterization of heroic figures and to use of the mythical past to talk about present issues. The difference between Euripides and his older colleagues was one of degree: his characters talked about the present more controversially and more pointedly than did those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, sometimes even challenging the democratic order. Thus, for example, Odysseus is represented in Hecuba (lines 131–32) as [...] "agile-minded, sweet-talking, demos-pleasing" [...] i.e., a type of the war-time demagogues that were active in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. Speakers in the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles sometimes distinguished between slaves who are servile by nature and those who are slaves by mere circumstance but Euripides' speakers go further, positing an individual's mental rather than social or physical condition as the true index of worth. Thus in Hippolytus, a love-sick queen rationalizes her position and arrives at this comment on intrinsic merit while reflecting on adultery: ...|$|E
