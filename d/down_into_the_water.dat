25|$|As well as Saunders-Roe and Vickers (which {{combined}} in 1966 {{to form the}} British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC)), other commercial craft were developed during the 1960s in the UK by Cushioncraft (part of the Britten-Norman Group) and Hovermarine based at Woolston (the latter being sidewall hovercraft, where {{the sides of the}} hull projected <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to trap the cushion of air with normal hovercraft skirts at the bow and stern). One of these models, the HM-2, was used by Red Funnel between Southampton (near the Woolston Floating Bridge) and Cowes.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for her, black-haired Lavigne and {{her friends}} happen to be present at the venue as well. As soon as she {{and her friends}} see them, black-haired Lavigne hits her {{in the head with a}} golf ball, {{resulting}} in the red-haired girl splashing <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Her boyfriend tries to grab her hand but misses, to black-haired Lavigne's amusement. Finally, the man, who eventually develops feelings for black-haired Lavigne, is seen waiting for her. As she comes toward him, they soon hold hands together, but red-haired girl sees this and attempts to seize black-haired Lavigne. But black-haired Lavigne and the man manage to dodge her, and in her attempt to win back her boyfriend, she tumbles all the way down and lands in a portable toilet ahead, where she gives a look of desperation towards the camera, showing she has failed to do so, and signalling that black-haired Lavigne has finally won the man's affections. Blonde Lavigne then takes her new boyfriend into a bathroom stall and slightly opens the door after a moment and pumps her arm in victory.|$|E

25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E
500|$|The waters around Hilton Head Island {{are one of}} the {{few places}} on Earth where {{dolphins}} routinely use a technique called [...] "strand feeding", whereby schools of fish are herded up onto mud banks, and the dolphins lie on their side while they feed before sliding back <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E
50|$|Longstone's most {{dramatic}} features are the Slateford Aqueduct (1822) carrying the Union Canal and the adjacent railway viaduct (1842).

500|$|The Rhinemaidens' sorrow in {{the loss}} of the gold is deep and heartfelt. As the gods are {{crossing}} <b>the</b> rainbow bridge <b>into</b> Valhalla at <b>the</b> end of Das Rheingold, Loge ironically suggests that, {{in the absence of the}} gold, the maidens should [...] "bask in the gods’ new-found radiance". The maidens' lament then becomes a stern reproof: [...] "Tender and true are only the depths", they sing; [...] "False and cowardly is all that rejoices up there".

500|$|The keel for Trento {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Odero Terni Orlando {{shipyard}} on 8 February 1925. The completed hull {{was scheduled to be}} launched on 4 September 1927, but sabotage from anti-fascist workers in the shipyard, who had mixed sand into the grease on the slipway, preventing the ship from sliding <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> After repeated attempts to complete the launching, the shipyard had to resort to dragging Trento from the slipway on 4 October 1927 using the passenger ship [...] After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 3 April 1929. On 11 May 1929, Trento became the flagship of the Cruiser Division; five days later, she and her sister [...] began a cruise in the northern Mediterranean, which included a stop in Barcelona. The two cruisers returned to La Spezia on 4 June. Trento started a much more ambitious cruise the following month, departing Italian waters on 23 July, bound for South America. Over the following three months, she visited Cape Verde, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Bahía Blanca, Las Palmas, and Tangiers, before arriving back in Italy on 10 October.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the phenomenon of foreign bodies in the same spectrum in remote sensing images, as needs of land-use surveys, traditional methods often can’t get good results. In this paper, an efficient method for dividing the classifying results of traditional methods into further items is proposed and studied. Our approach to remote sensing image fine classification is based on both geometric features and SVM. By {{making full use of}} geometric features in the structure of property characteristics, we produce rules of the morphological characteristics and distribution. With deductive reasoning, we further classify the classifying results of SVM classifier. Tests showed that the method can be better broken <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of rivers, lakes, reservoirs and ponds...|$|R

2500|$|A 2 ½ {{inch pipe}} was pointed, {{perforated}} {{and covered with}} a sheet of fine perforated brass. This was driven <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> area by means of a small pulley bar and monkey, or by a sledge–hammer; and additional lengths of pipe were added if necessary. The ordinary General Service [...] "Lift and Force Pump" [...] was then attached. This arrangement proved so efficient that [...] "Spear Points" [...] were issued to every Squadron in the Division, and the RE Troops carried a number of them. Our men were thus enabled to get water at any of the hods in the desert in a very short space of time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reporting}} to Washington for his two-year term in Congress (beginning March 1847), Lincoln retained Zenas C. Robbins, patent attorney. Robbins most probably had drawings done by Robert Washington Fenwick, his apprentice artist. Robbins processed the application, which became patent No. 6,469 on May 22, 1849. However, {{it was never}} produced for practical use. There are doubts {{as to whether it}} would have actually worked: It [...] "likely would not have been practical," [...] stated Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the National Museum of American History, [...] "because you need a lot of force to get the buoyant chambers even two feet <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> My gut feeling is that it might have been made to work, but Lincoln's considerable talents lay elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} the pseudo-Cyprian De Rebaptismate says that on the {{strength}} of the words of John, that [...] "we were to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire," [...] the Simonians maintained that the orthodox baptism was a mere form, and that they had the real baptism, for, as soon as their neophytes went <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> a fire appeared on it. The writer does not dispute the fact, but is at a loss what to make of it. Was it a bit of jugglery, or a natural phenomenon, or a piece of self-deception, or an effect of magic? In advocacy of this baptism, we are told, there was composed by the same heretics a book which was inscribed the Preaching of Paul.|$|E
6000|$|It was evening, and {{the lights}} of the city were {{everywhere}} glittering like long lines of quivering gold <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> Bosporus. Here the party with which Lancey had travelled left him, without even saying good-bye,--all except his guardian, who, on landing, made signs that he was to follow, or, rather, to walk beside him. Reduced by this time to a thoroughly obedient slave, and satisfied that no mischief was likely to be intended by men who had treated him so well, Lancey walked through the crowded streets and bazaars of Constantinople as one in a dream, much more than half-convinced that he had got somehow into an [...] "Arabian Night," [...] the [...] "entertainments" [...] of which seemed much more real than those by which his imagination had been charmed in days of old.|$|R

2500|$|PGM-18, while {{following}} behind YMS-103 {{and destroying}} mines {{she and other}} minesweepers cut loose, struck and detonated a mine. Eyewitnesses on nearby ships reported that the explosion was so powerful they could see five feet of sunlight under her keel before she came back <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> rolled over, and then foundered. YMS-103, {{in an attempt to}} rescue survivors, struck two mines, blowing off her bow and stem. [...] Despite this, she was able to remain afloat. [...] PGM-18 suffered thirteen dead or missing and YMS-103 suffered five killed and seven wounded. [...] The survivors were picked up by other ships in the area. PGM-18 was only in service for 111 days before her destruction and received a battle star for her involvement in the Battle of Okinawa.|$|E
2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing <b>down</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft. The pattern of damage to the nose and the underside of the fuselage suggests the aircraft was in a slightly nose-down attitude, as if in a normal descent. Nearly neutral trim settings indicated the pilot was not trying to compensate for some abnormal flying condition, such as an engine failure or flight control problems. The pitch trim was set to a slight nose-down attitude, which the aircraft manufacturer calculated to indicate stable flight at 110–120 kts. This is consistent with investigators' calculations based on the damage to the aircraft that it had been moving at 90–130 kts at impact. Damage to the propeller blades is consistent with both of them turning and similar engine power being delivered to them. The amount of power being delivered to the propellers could not be determined. Therefore, it remains possible that ice had accumulated in the carburetors and reduced engine power. Although meteorological conditions were favorable for carburetor icing, and the carburetor heat levers were in the [...] "OFF" [...] position, loss of engine power is not consistent with the speed and shallow angle of impact calculated from the wreckage. Analysis of the engines verified that carburetor heat was not being used {{at the time of the}} accident. The AAIB concluded its analysis of the wreckage with the following statement: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Is it even so?' said Acrisius, 'then let Zeus guard his own.' He bade his men drag Danae {{from the}} altar; and lock her {{again in the}} house of bronze; while he had a great strong chest made.
