Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the {{battalion}} {{remained in the}} Kairivu area throughout September and into early October, when the majority of {{the battalion}} moved back to Wewak. Patrols were sent out into the surrounding areas as Japanese soldiers were brought in for surrender and repatriation. Meanwhile, the demobilisation process began with high priority long service troops being repatriated to Australia in drafts as shipping became available. At this time, some of the battalion's personnel volunteered for service in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The majority of these were transferred to the 67th Infantry Battalion, although some also served in the 66th Infantry Battalion. By November, the battalion was down to a posted strength of just 375 personnel. On 18 December 1945, the remaining cadre of the battalion embarked for Australia. As personnel marched out of the unit – <b>either</b> <b>for</b> demobilisation or for subsequent service – and equipment was handed back, the unit was disbanded at Puckapunyal in February 1946.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one {{professional}} football team, Arbroath, who play in Scottish League One, the third tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Arbroath play their home matches at Gayfield Park, which holds {{the record for}} being the closest stadium to the sea in European football (around 5½ yards from the high tide line). Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Further goals were disallowed <b>either</b> <b>for</b> offside, or {{because it was not}} clear whether the ball had gone into the goal. For this reason the AFC supporters' club is called the 36–0 club in memory of this event. Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, <b>either</b> <b>for</b> use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was <b>either</b> <b>for</b> attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
