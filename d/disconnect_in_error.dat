30|$|In {{this section}} {{we examine the}} {{question}} of whether behavioral links tend to weaken and dissolve after the corresponding edges in the nomination layer decay. To that end, we measure the rate at which pairs of nodes that become <b>disconnected</b> <b>in</b> the nomination layer also become <b>disconnected</b> <b>in</b> the communication and collocation layers. Then we compare that with the rate at which behavioral links dissolve at random. We want to ascertain whether nodes that first experience a dissolution event in the nomination layer are more likely to dissolve edges in the behavioral layers than a random dyad does.|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} {{with which}} MODFLOW simulates surface water-groundwater interaction is examined for connected and disconnected losing streams. We compare {{the effect of}} different vertical and horizontal discretization within MODFLOW and also compare MODFLOW simulations with those produced by HydroGeoSphere. HydroGeoSphere is able to simulate both saturated and unsaturated flow, as well as surface water, groundwater and the full coupling between them in a physical way, and so {{is used as a}} reference code to quantify the influence of some of the simplifying assumptions of MODFLOW. In particular, we show that (1) the inability to simulate negative pressures beneath <b>disconnected</b> streams <b>in</b> MODFLOW results in an underestimation of the infiltration flux; (2) a river in MODFLOW is either fully connected or fully <b>disconnected,</b> while <b>in</b> reality transitional stages between the two flow regimes exist; (3) limitations in the horizontal discretization of the river can cause a mismatch between river width and cell width, resulting <b>in</b> an <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the water table position under the river; and (4) because coarse vertical discretization of the aquifer is often used to avoid the drying out of cells, this may result <b>in</b> an <b>error</b> <b>in</b> simulating the height of the groundwater mound. Conditions under which these errors are significant are investigated...|$|R
