5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that he feels the case <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and they should return to Washington.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are willing to go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|During {{his playing}} career, Shankly {{said he would}} not argue with referees. He {{realised}} after taking the advice of his brothers that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The referee, he wrote, [...] "always wins in the end".|$|E

500|$|In 2016 in Saudi Arabia, Grand Mufti Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh {{issued a}} {{religious}} fatwa declaring that chess is banned for Muslims. He stated that [...] "chess <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{and an opportunity}} to squander money. It causes enmity and hatred between people". However, this fatwa is not legally binding and chess remains a popular game in Muslim countries.|$|E
500|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{continues}} to despair over the murder case of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which {{he failed to}} solve. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) orders Bayliss and Pembleton {{to move on and}} take new cases, they are assigned to solve the murder of Jake, a police dog. Bayliss thinks it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but according to municipal law, the death of a city-owned animal is treated as an official investigation, and Pembleton decides to take the case seriously. The dog's gums are extremely red, and Pembleton believes he may have been poisoned or gassed. They question local dog pound employee Penny (Joy Ehrlich),who admits she accidentally killed Jake with carbon monoxide after mixing him up with another dog, then dumped the body in a panic. John Kuehn (Nick Olcott), Jake's human [...] "partner", scatters Jake's ashes in a lake and Bayliss, reminded of Adena Watson, reacts emotionally.|$|E
500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> since they could just buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him {{that this was not}} a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E

2500|$|Godzilla vs. Megaguirus was {{released}} theatrically in Japan on December 16, 2000 {{where it was}} distributed by Toho. The film {{was released}} directly to television in the United States by Columbia TriStar with an English dub. There are some inconsistencies in the translation of the dub however, including one scene where Hajime tells Kiriko that body building <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> since they'll be making Godzilla disappear [...] "up his own butthole" [...] rather than their artificially created [...] "black hole" [...] as the original version states.|$|E
2500|$|Patrick [...] "Pat" [...] Clifton {{also known}} as [...] "Postman Pat" [...] (voiced by Stephen Mangan), is a {{friendly}} postman who has been delivering letters {{in the village of}} Greendale in the north of England for years. He wants to take his wife, Sara (voiced by Susan Duerden), on a late honeymoon to Italy. He plans to afford it through a bonus from his employer, the Special Delivery Service (SDS), but their new boss, Edwin Carbunkle (voiced by Peter Woodward), has cancelled all bonuses. He plans to make SDS more efficient by replacing its human workers with robots, thinking that being friendly <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another idea in {{this vein}} is the {{creation}} of [...] "attention bonds," [...] small warranties that some information will not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> the recipient's time, placed into escrow at the time of sending [...] Like the granters of interrupt rights, receivers could cash in their bonds to signal to the sender that <b>a</b> given communication <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> their time or elect not to cash them in to signal that more communication would be welcome.|$|R

2500|$|Robin and Patrick host Thanksgiving {{dinner for}} the family at their new house. Though Patrick is {{initially}} kept in the dark, Robin plots with Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) and Molly Lansing (Haley Pullos) to set up their mother, Alexis Davis with Robin's Uncle Mac. Robin tells a skeptical Sam that the two guests of honor had very obvious chemistry at Maxie's [...] "nonwedding" [...] to Damian Spinelli (Bradford Anderson). But Alexis and Mac realize something is afoot and tell the girls it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Matt also attends the dinner, unexpectedly bringing along Dr. Lisa Niles (Brianna Brown), an ex-girlfriend of Patrick's who is town. Patrick gives her a warm hug and Robin, though surprised, tells Lisa she is welcome. Maxie, nursing influenza, misses the family event.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{was never}} {{questioned}} about the killing. According to an RUC detective, {{he was not}} interrogated for [...] "reasons of operational strategy". Weir suggested that [...] "Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC Special Branch agent." [...] The Barron Report stated that Weir had made an offer to testify against Jackson and Robert John [...] "R.J". Kerr, but only {{on the condition that}} the murder charge against him was withdrawn. This offer was refused by the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions who said"Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police state they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police consensus is that to arrest and interview either man <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers. Nevertheless the police do not recommend consideration of withdrawal of charges against Weir. I agree with this view. Weir and McCaughey must be proceeded against. When proceedings against them are terminated the position may be reviewed in respect of Jackson and Kerr".|$|E
