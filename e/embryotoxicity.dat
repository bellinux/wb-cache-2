40|$|<b>Embryotoxicity</b> of glycol ethers {{is caused}} by their alkoxyacetic acid metabolites, but the {{mechanism}} underlying the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of these acid metabolites is so far not known. The present study investigates a possible mechanism underlying the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of glycol ether alkoxyacetic acid metabolites using the methoxyacetic acid (MAA) metabolite of {{ethylene glycol monomethyl ether}} as the model compound. The results obtained demonstrate an MAA-induced decrease of the intracellular pH (pH i) of embryonic BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells as well as of embryonic stem (ES) -D 3 cells, at concentrations that affect ES-D 3 cell differentiation. These results suggest a mechanism for MAA-mediated <b>embryotoxicity</b> similar to the mechanism of <b>embryotoxicity</b> of the drugs valproic acid and acetazolamide (ACZ), known to decrease the pH i in vivo, and therefore used as positive controls. The embryotoxic alkoxyacetic acid metabolites ethoxyacetic acid, butoxyacetic acid and phenoxyacetic acid also caused an intracellular acidification of BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells at concentrations that are known to inhibit ES-D 3 cell differentiation. Two other embryotoxic compounds, all-trans-retinoic acid and 5 -fluorouracil, did not decrease the pH i of embryonic cells at concentrations that affect ES-D 3 cell differentiation, pointing at a different mechanism of <b>embryotoxicity</b> of these compounds. MAA and ACZ induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ES-D 3 cell differentiation, which was enhanced by amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na + /H + -antiporter, corroborating an important role of the pH i in the embryotoxic mechanism of both compounds.

Methods The effect of the medium conditioned by composites and amalgam on mouse blastocysts in vitro was tested. The materials were also subcutaneously implanted, {{and the effect of}} the medium supplemented with serum from the host blood was evaluated in the <b>embryotoxicity</b> assay. The embryo implantation rate in the material-transplanted mothers was also evaluated. Results The results show that while the culture in media conditioned by amalgams did not affect blastocyst development, the medium conditioned by composites caused blastocyst degeneration and apoptosis. The development of blastocysts in a medium containing serum obtained from animals after transplantation was, however, without effect. Finally, inconsistent reduction in the implantation rate in transplanted mothers was observed. Conclusions In this study, we provide examples of in vitro and in vivo tests that may be used to evaluate <b>embryotoxicity</b> for dental materials. Our results show that leached components from our composite-material induced <b>embryotoxicity</b> in vitro, however, no toxicity was observed when subcutaneously implanted in vivo.

For evaluating <b>embryotoxicity,</b> we applied the total morphological scoring system (TMS) in embryos exposed for 48 h. The compounds tested showed <b>embryotoxicity</b> in a dose-response fashion. Functional analysis of differential {{gene expression}} after 4 h exposure at the ID 10 (effective dose for 10 % decreased TMS), revealed the sterol biosynthesis pathway and embryonic development genes, dominated by genes in the retinoic acid (RA) pathway, albeit in a differential way. Flusilazole, ketoconazole and triadimefon were the most potent compounds affecting the RA pathway, while in terms of regulation of sterol function, difenoconazole and ketoconazole showed the most pronounced effects. Dose-dependent analysis of the effects of flusilazole revealed that the RA pathway related genes were already differentially expressed at low dose levels while the sterol pathway showed strong regulation at higher embryotoxic doses, suggesting that this pathway is less predictive for the observed <b>embryotoxicity.</b> A similar analysis at the 24 -hour time point indicated an additional time-dependent difference in the aforementioned pathways regulated by flusilazole. In summary, the rat WEC assay in combination with transcriptomics could add a mechanistic insight into the embryotoxic potency ranking and pharmacological mode of action of the tested compounds...|$|E

40|$|Mothers with {{untreated}} phenylketonuria (PKU) have {{an increased}} risk of bearing children with congenital malformations. PKU causes accumulation of phenylalanine (PHE) and its metabolites in urine and blood, and this condition may contribute to the developmental problems. In the present study we investigated the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of these compounds in the rat postimplantation embryo culture system. Whereas PHE was ineffective, phenylpyruvic acid and phenylacetic acid induced general growth retardation. Phenylacetic acid and O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were also growth retarding and in addition affected yolk sac circulation. Phenylethylamine was the most embryotoxic compound tested, with a lowest effective concentration of 0. 03 g/l. It induced various anomalies including incomplete flexion and neural tube defects. The effects of a mixture of phenylketones in culture did not reveal synergism between compounds. In the presence of maternal hepatocytes PHE was metabolized in culture without leading to embryotoxic effects. Extending culture duration from 26 to 48 hours did not increase sensitivity to phenylpyruvic acid. No changes in osmolarity or pH of media were observed that might have been responsible for the <b>embryotoxicity</b> observed. Analysis with HPLC of media after culture revealed no biotransformation of added compounds into other metabolites, except for phenylpyruvic acid. In addition, in the presence of maternal hepatocytes, metabolism was observed that was not accompanied with embryotoxic effects. Embryo culture in human PKU sera, either or not supplemented with 5 % (v/v) rat serum, was not detrimental to development. Rather, embryo's tended to thrive better on PKU sera versus control sera. Analysis of human PKU sera revaled lower glucose levels and increased levels of PHE and PKU-related metabolites. The results suggest that the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of PKU-related phenylketones may contribute to teratogenicity of maternal PKU in man. However, in view of the relatively high concentrations necessary for <b>embryotoxicity</b> to occur in vitro, other factors yet unknown may play a significant role. Alternatively, the absence of <b>embryotoxicity</b> of human PKU sera in culture may be interpreted to suggest that the rat postimplantation embryo culture technique may not contain the developmental en points that are most vulnerable in maternal PKU. ...|$|E

Among them, diuron (3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea) is a phenylurea herbicide frequently detected in oyster-producing area, known to be toxic for this important exploited non-target species. With the aim to investigate the mechanisms by which diuron displays its toxicity in oyster, the implication of both biotransformation and oxygen reactive species (ROS) production was studied considering <b>embryotoxicity</b> and genotoxicity as endpoints. Comparative <b>embryotoxicity</b> and genotoxicity of diuron and its main metabolites (DCPMU, DCPU and 3, 4 -DCA) were thus studied on oyster larvae by the embryo-larval bioassay on D larvae and the comet assay on trochophore larvae, respectively. Exposures were also performed in presence and absence of known ROS scavenger compounds − ascorbic acid and N-acetylcysteine, to evaluate the involvement of oxyradicals in the toxic responses. In the case of diuron, the production of ROS on exposed oyster larvae was also measured using 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a probe for flow cytometric analysis. The results we obtained showed the <b>embryotoxicity</b> and genotoxicity of diuron and its metabolites in early life stages of the Pacific oyster. For concentrations ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 5 μg. L− 1, diuron appeared significantly more embryotoxic than DCPMU and DCPU (p < 0. 001). <b>Embryotoxicity</b> decreased with diuron metabolism as follows: diuron ≥ DCPMU = DCPU, highlighting that biotransformation can constitute a true detoxication pathways in oyster larvae by decreasing the toxicity of the parent compound. In the opposite, no difference was observed between diuron and its metabolites concerning larval development when considering a lower and more environmentally realistic range of concentrations (0. 002 to 0. 050 μg.

Concerning genotoxicity, no significant difference was observed between diuron and all of its metabolites including 3, 4 DCA with damages detected from the concentration of 0. 05 μg. L− 1. As for diuron, the toxicity of the metabolites seems to be mediated in some part by ROS production as clearly demonstrated by the decrease in genotoxicity and developmental abnormalities {{in the presence of the}} oxidant scavenger, ascorbic acid...|$|E
40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) {{belongs to}} the type B group of trichothecenes family, which is {{composed}} of sesquiterpenoid metabolites produced by Fusarium and other fungi in grain. DON may cause various toxicities, such as cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity as well as teratogenicity and carcinogenicity. In the present study, we focus on a hypothesis that DON alters the expressions of Nrf 2 /HO- 1 pathway by inducing <b>embryotoxicity</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 mouse (5. 0, 2. 5, 1. 0, and 0 mg/kg/day) and BeWo cell lines (0 and 50 nM; 3 h, 12 h and 24 h). Our results indicate that DON treatment in mice during pregnancy leads to ROS accumulation in the placenta, which results in <b>embryotoxicity.</b> At the same time Nrf 2 /HO- 1 pathway is up-regulated by ROS to protect placenta cells from oxidative damage. In DON-treated BeWo cells, the level of ROS has time–effect and dose–effect relationships with HO- 1 expression. Moderate increase in HO- 1 protects the cell from oxidative damage, while excessive increase in HO- 1 aggravates the oxidative damage, which is called in some studies the “threshold effect”. Therefore, oxidative stress may be the critical molecular mechanism for DON-induced <b>embryotoxicity.</b> Besides, Nrf 2 /HO- 1 pathway accompanied by the “threshold effect” also {{plays an important role}} against DON-induced oxidative damage in this process...|$|E
40|$|License, which permits {{unrestricted}} use, distribution, {{and reproduction}} in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. The embryonic Stem cell Test (EST) is a validated assay for testing <b>embryotoxicity</b> in vitro. The {{total duration of}} this protocol is 10 days, and its main end-point is based on histological determinations. It is suggested that improvements on EST must be focused toward molecular end-points and, if possible, to reduce the total assay duration. Five days of exposure of D 3 cells in monolayers under spontaneous differentiation to 50 ng/mL of the strong embryotoxic 5 -fluorouracil or to 75 μg/mL of the weak embryotoxic 5, 5 -diphenylhydeantoin caused between 20 and 74 % of reductions in {{the expression of the}} following genes: Pnpla 6, Afp, Hdac 7, Vegfa,andNes. The exposure to 1 mg/mL of nonembryotoxic saccharin only caused statistically significant reductions in the expression of Nes. These exposures reduced cell viability of D 3 cells by 15, 28, and 34 %. We applied these records to the mathematical discriminating function of the EST method to find that this approach is able to correctly predict the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of all three above-mentioned chemicals. Therefore, this work proposes the possibility of improve EST by reducing its total duration and by introducing gene expression as biomarker of differentiation, which might be very interesting for in vitro risk assessment <b>embryotoxicity.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Several {{in vitro}} and in vivo studies suggest local and {{systemic}} effects following exposure to carbon nanotubes. No data are available, however, on their possible <b>embryotoxicity</b> in mammals. In this study, {{we tested the}} effect of pristine and oxidized single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) {{on the development of}} the mouse embryo. To this end, SWCNTs (from 10 ng to 30 μg/mouse) were administered to female mice soon after implantation (postcoital day 5. 5); 10 days later, animals were sacrificed, and uteri, placentas, and fetuses examined. A high percentage of early miscarriages and fetal malformations was observed in females exposed to oxidized SWCNTs, while lower percentages were found in animals exposed to the pristine material. The lowest effective dose was 100 ng/mouse. Extensive vascular lesions and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected in placentas of malformed but not of normally developed fetuses. Increased ROS levels were likewise detected in malformed fetuses. No increased ROS production or evident morphological alterations were observed in maternal tissues. No fetal and placental abnormalities were ever observed in control animals. In parallel, SWCNT <b>embryotoxicity</b> was evaluated using the embryonic stem cell test (EST), a validated in vitro assay developed for predicting <b>embryotoxicity</b> of soluble chemical compounds, but never applied in full to nanoparticles. The EST predicted the in vivo data, identifying oxidized SWCNTs as the more toxic compound...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The growing global {{production}} of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) suggests a realistic {{increase in the}} environmental exposure to such a nanomaterial, making the knowledge of its biological reactivity and its safe-by-design synthesis mandatory. In this study, the <b>embryotoxicity</b> of ZnONPs (1 – 100 mg/L) specifically synthesized for industrial purposes with different sizes, shapes (round, rod) and surface coatings (PEG, PVP) was tested using the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) to identify potential target tissues and the most sensitive developmental stages. The ZnONPs did not cause embryolethality, but induced {{a high incidence of}} malformations, in particular misfolded gut and abdominal edema. Smaller, round NPs were more effective than the bigger, rod ones, and PEGylation determined a reduction in <b>embryotoxicity.</b> Ingestion appeared to be the most relevant exposure route. Only the embryos exposed from the stomodeum openin...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of sera from monkeys with {{histories}} of reproductive failure found autoantibodies to laminin were the embryotoxic factor within the serum. When monkeys with excellent reproductive histories were immunized with laminin, their sera became embryotoxic {{and they could}} not reproduce successfully. Sera from some rats immunized with laminin were embryotoxic, while others were not embryotoxic. Antilaminin antibody levels in these rats could not predict toxicity, however toxic sera was found to recognize different epitopes on laminin than the nontoxic sera. ^ As the monkeys in the original study had naturally occurring antibodies to laminin, the role of antilaminin autoantibodies in <b>embryotoxicity</b> was examined. Injection of mercuric chloride into Brown Norway rats {{has been found to}} induce autoimmune glomerulonephritis that produced autoantibodies to laminin. In the present study, sera from Brown Norway treated with mercuric chloride were tested in culture and were associated with <b>embryotoxicity</b> and embryolethality. Affinity purified antibodies from these rats were also found to cause <b>embryotoxicity</b> in a dose dependent manner. ^ Using laminin immunized monkey sera, the mechanisms of antilaminin antibody <b>embryotoxicity</b> was found to involve the antilaminin antibodies binding to the cell surfaces of the visceral yolk sac. This binding was found to cause reductions in the number of microvilli on the cell surfaces that in turn reduced the uptake of nutrients. Methionine supplementation was found to overcome the toxicity of sera from one monkey and not the other. This was linked to the level of antibody binding to the yolk sac. As epitope specificity of antilaminin antibodies were found to distinguish toxic and non-toxic sera, monkeys were immunized with four characterized laminin peptides, YIGSR, RGD, IKVAV and a peptide of no known function. Sera from the YIGSR and RGD immunized monkeys were embryotoxic and these monkeys could not reproduce successfully. Again toxicity was related not to antilaminin antibody levels but to yolk sac binding. This suggested that toxicity of antilaminin antibodies was related to the exposure of laminin epitopes in the yolk sac. ...|$|E
