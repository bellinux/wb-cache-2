5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of <b>his</b> <b>socks</b> had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E

Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. John's articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how <b>his</b> <b>socks</b> often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper.|$|E

25|$|First-round debutants at the Crucible were England's Craig Steadman and Stuart Carrington, Scotland's Anthony McGill, and Norway's Kurt Maflin. McGill and Carrington {{had both}} {{played at the}} Crucible before, in the Junior Pot Black in 2006. Mark Selby {{narrowly}} escaped a first-round exit, recovering from 8–9 down against Maflin to clinch a 10–9 win. In his match against Steadman, Ronnie O'Sullivan risked a sanction for removing a pair of uncomfortable shoes and playing briefly in <b>his</b> <b>socks,</b> before borrowing a replacement pair of shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. Ali Carter, back at the Crucible after extensive treatment for cancer, won his match 10–5 against Alan McManus.|$|E
500|$|Starr's {{idiosyncratic}} {{turns of}} phrase, or Ringoisms as they became known, {{such as a}} hard day's night and tomorrow never knows, were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: [...] "Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... {{they were sort of}} magic". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line [...] "darning <b>his</b> <b>socks</b> in the night when there's nobody there" [...] from [...] "Eleanor Rigby".|$|E

The Hare Krishna devotees {{regularly}} attended the sessions also; Spector later cited their presence {{as an example of}} how Harrison inspired tolerance in non-believers, since the Temple devotees could be [...] "the biggest pain in the necks in the world", according to Spector. Among the many unreleased songs from the All Things Must Pass sessions, Harrison recorded his all-Sanskrit composition [...] "Gopala Krishna", which Leng describes as [...] "a rocking companion to 'Awaiting on You All'".|$|E

He continued his good form with a well-hit low volley in a 2–0 home win over Cardiff City.

500|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1990, the son of Thomas Robinson, Sr., and Dorothea Robinson. [...] Robinson began playing pee-wee {{football}} by age 10 and played the game with his shoes untied, thus earning the nickname [...] "Shoelace" [...] as a child. [...] Those who saw him play at Westside Park in Deerfield Beach recall:"Kids would go for his shoes on tackles, and he'd {{come up to the}} huddle in just socks. [...] His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around his shoes. When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even rolled <b>his</b> <b>socks</b> over his shoes. He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade." ...|$|E

During the night, Smith took off his shoes, and found in the morning that they had frozen and that he could not put them on. He continued in <b>his</b> <b>socks,</b> which wore through, forcing him to finish the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. After 23 days since Smith and Bill set off from Piancastagna, they met American troops who took them to a local base camp, from where they were returned to their respective forces. The Americans took Smith to Marseille, from where he was flown to the RAF transit camp at Naples.

500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in <b>his</b> <b>socks,</b> before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Construction {{began on}} Sands Hotel in early 1952, built to a design by Wayne McAllister. Freedman had {{initially}} intended naming the hotel [...] "Holiday Inn" [...] after the {{film of the}} same name starring Bing Crosby, but after noticing that <b>his</b> <b>socks</b> became so full of sand decided to name it Sands. The tag line would be [...] "A Place in the Sun", named after a recently released film starring Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, and quite suitable to the hot desert location of Las Vegas. The hotel was opened on December 15, 1952 as a casino with 200 rooms, and was established less than three months after the opening of another prominent landmark, Sahara Hotel and Casino. The opening was widely publicized, and the hotel was visited by some 12,000 people within a few hours. At the inauguration were 146 journalists and special guests such as Arlene Dahl, Fernando Lamas, Esther Williams, and Terry Moore. Every guest was given a Chamois bag with silver dollars, and Sands ended up losing $200,000 within the first eight hours. Danny Thomas, Jimmy McHugh and the Copa Girls, labelled [...] "the most beautiful girls in the world", performed in the Copa Room on opening night, and Ray Sinatra and his Orchestra were the initial house band. Thomas was hired to perform for the first two weeks, but strained his voice on the second night and developed laryngitis, and was replaced with performers such as Jimmy Durante, Frankie Laine, Jane Powell, the Ritz Brothers, and Ray Anthony.|$|E
500|$|Scott, Wilson and Shackleton left on 2 November 1902 {{with dogs}} and {{supporting}} parties. Their goal was [...] "to {{get as far}} south {{in a straight line}} on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. However, the lack of skill with dogs was soon evident, and progress was slow. After the support parties had returned, on 15 November, Scott's group began relaying their loads (taking half loads forward, then returning for the other half), thus travelling three miles for every mile of southward progress. Mistakes had been made with the dogs' food, and as the dogs grew weaker, Wilson was forced to kill the weakest as food for the others. The men, too, were struggling, afflicted by snow blindness, frostbite and symptoms of early scurvy, but they continued southwards in line with the mountains to the west. Christmas Day was celebrated with double rations, and a Christmas pudding that Shackleton had kept for the occasion, hidden with <b>his</b> <b>socks.</b> On 30 December 1902, without having left the Barrier, they reached their Furthest South at 82°17′S. Troubles multiplied on the home journey, as the remaining dogs died and Shackleton collapsed with scurvy. Wilson's diary entry for 14 January 1903 acknowledged that [...] "we all have slight, though definite symptoms of scurvy". Scott and Wilson struggled on, with Shackleton, who was unable to pull, walking alongside and occasionally carried on the sledge. The party eventually reached the ship on 3 February 1903 after covering [...] including relays, in 93days' travel at a daily average of just over [...]|$|E
