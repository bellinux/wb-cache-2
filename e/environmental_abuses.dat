Urban areas had grown beyond their capacities to sustain themselves. Crowded cities were facing problems such as high crime rates, traffic jams, severely overcrowded schools, and overtaxed public services; the report noted that water shortages were ironic, given the [...] of rain the region received annually.|$|E

5000|$|On January 19, 2007, Duncan {{accepted}} the NDP nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona, by acclamation, to again seek election to Parliament in the 40th Canadian federal election. The election campaign began in September 2008. To make environmental protection an election issue, Duncan and Jack Layton {{flew over the}} tar sands area noting environmentally damaging practices. Duncan made support for public health care, enforcement of environmental laws, and driving the economy with 'green jobs' priorities in her campaign. She drew upon support from a large volunteer network built since the last election and strategic voting from Liberal supporters. With the polls showing a close race, incumbent Conservative candidate launched an attack ad against Duncan. On election night, October 14, the results showed Jaffer as the leader, by 1,000 votes with over half the polls reporting. Jaffer delivered his victory speech around 10 p.m. and several people were calling the election a win for Jaffer. However, late polls, which included residences around the University of Alberta, put Duncan ahead. Following {{a few days of}} silence and after his fiancee, fellow Conservative Member of Parliament Helena Guergis, flew to Edmonton and quietly married him, Jaffer conceded defeat to Duncan. With a 463-vote margin, Duncan became the only non-Conservative MP in Alberta.During the ensuing 40th Canadian Parliament Duncan was appointed to the position of NDP critic on the Environment. In the Parliament's aborted first session she strongly opposed the government's proposed fiscal update, especially the proposed changes to pay equity claims, four-year wage cap, and suspension of the right to strike for federal employees. She supported the proposed coalition government and condemned the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, for labeling the coalition government as [...] "treasonous" [...] and [...] "criminal". When Parliament resumed in January 2009, Duncan sat {{as a member of the}} House Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. She supported Ecojustice and the Sierra Club's lawsuit against the government's waiver of federal environmental assessment reviews on infrastructure projects arguing that it required an act of Parliament, rather than the Conservative government's Order in Council. She vocally supported the opposition's Corporate Accountability of Mining, Oil and Gas Corporations in Developing Countries Act that would hold Canadian companies accountable in Canadian courts for human rights and <b>environmental</b> <b>abuses</b> committed in other countries. Duncan introduced three bills into during the second and third sessions: the first proposing that the third Friday of February be declared National Hockey Day, the second establishing an Environmental Bill of Rights, and the third would have amended the Criminal Code to restrict the use of hand-held telecommunications devices while driving. On a private member's bill to abolish the federal gun registry, Linda Duncan was the only MP from Alberta who voted against abolishing the gun registry.|$|E

40|$|In {{this age}} of {{transnational}} capitalism most victims of corporate malpractice have no means to hold the wrongdoers to account - especially those whose lives are blighted day-in, day-out by the "normal" operations of companies within {{the letter of the}} law. This paper argues that corporate social and <b>environmental</b> <b>abuses</b> are rooted in a lack of accountability of corporations to their stakeholders. It explores how governance mechanisms such as corporate engagement by "socially responsible" investors could enhance stakeholder accountability. It identifies and contrasts two paradigms in socially responsible investment engagement, and relates them to voluntary and regulatory responses to corporate abuses. It concludes that the development of standards for stakeholder-oriented engagement and governance could help stimulate effective regulatory measures to protect stakeholder interests.

40|$|The latest vogue in bird {{conservation}} is concern over species that breed in the United States and Canada but winter mostly {{south of the}} United States-Mexico border.

Nonetheless, the concern about neotropical migrants, institutionalized by the Partners in Flight program, has served several purposes. For one, biologists are taking a broader view of the problems these birds face, including breeding-season, migrational, and wintering processes. Also, there is a clearer acknowledgment that political boundaries are not recognized by migratory birds, which has fostered greater international cooperation.

40|$|AbstractThe indestructible {{nature of}} teeth against {{most of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>abuses</b> makes its use in {{disaster}} victim identification (DVI). The present study has been undertaken to examine the reliability of Gustafsonâ€™s qualitative method and Kediciâ€™s quantitative method of measuring secondary dentine for age estimation among North Western adult Indians. 196 (M= 85; F= 111) single rooted teeth were collected from the Department of Oral Health Sciences, PGIMER, Chandigarh. Ground sections were prepared {{and the amount of}} secondary dentine formed was scored qualitatively according to Gustafsonâ€™s (0 â€“ 3) scoring system (method 1) and quantitatively following Kediciâ€™s micrometric measurement method (method 2). Out of 196 teeth 180 samples (M= 80; F= 100) were found to be suitable for measuring secondary dentine following Kediciâ€™s method. Absolute mean error of age was calculated by both methodologies. Results clearly showed that in pooled data, method 1 gave an error of Â± 10. 4 years whereas method 2 exhibited an error of approximately Â± 13 years. A statistically significant difference was noted in absolute mean error of age between two methods of measuring secondary dentine for age estimation. Further, it was also revealed that teeth extracted for periodontal reasons severely decreased the accuracy of Kediciâ€™s method however, the disease had no effect while estimating age by Gustafsonâ€™s method. No significant gender differences were noted in the absolute mean error of age by both methods which suggest that {{there is no need to}} separate data on the basis of gender...|$|E
40|$|Development {{banks are}} key actors in climate finance. During the last decades, they have {{increased}} the funding of climate change related projects, especially those under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM aims at contributing to climate change mitigation while assisting in achieving sustainable development. However, many CDM projects have caused environmental damage and human rights abuses that especially affect the most vulnerable people. Located in Panama, the Barro Blanco hydro-power dam exemplifies the complex interrelationship of climate financing, development policies, {{the political and economic}} national context and human rights. Through the analysis of the role of development banks in climate finance, especially in the context of CDM projects, this paper aims (1) to clarify the role of development banks in climate finance, (2) to shed light on the vulnerable situation of the people affected by these projects, (3) to highlight the gaps in both the CDM rules and the development banksâ€™ safeguard policies concerning the protection of human rights and the prevention of <b>environmental</b> <b>abuses,</b> and (4) to give a current example of this complex situation through the Barro Blanco case study. This paper argues that the manifold and often competing national and international legal and political layers of climate change mitigation projects repeatedly leave project affected people vulnerable to human rights violations without adequate safeguards and mechanisms to effectively articulate their interests, protect their rights and promote access to justice...|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents.
