40|$|To devise {{low-carbon}} <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> product, in-depth {{knowledge about}} the variation mechanism of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions is the prerequisite. The determinants of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions in Chinese cement industry have been inquired by several researches recently. However, the impacts and abatement effect of <b>clinker</b> quality on <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions have not been identified yet. In technological sense, there lacks an integrated quantitative model that can elucidate the dynamic mechanism between <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and clinker quality. To fill this gap, this paper devises a CO 2 emission accounting framework integrated with optimization model to explore the dynamic mechanism between <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and clinker quality. Based on survey data of 2 typical <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> production lines in China, the accounting framework is validated with measured data. Through numerical simulation within this framework, a set of sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results indicate that if the target KH (lime saturation ratio) of both production lines climb from - 5 % to + 5 %, the process CO 2 emission factor will give rise to an increase of about 16. 4 and 14. 8 kg CO 2 /t clinker, respectively. With the same variation, the fuel CO 2 emission factors of two production lines will gain 17. 2 and 13. 7 kg CO 2 /t clinker, respectively. Obviously, controlled decrease of clinker quality can reduce CO 2 emission of clinker manufacturing. The results of sensitivity analysis are robust and highlight the remarkable role of clinker quality in both process and fuel emissions. Besides, the integrated framework can provide in-depth investigation into the dynamic mechanism between CO 2 emissions and the other determinants. Using this framework, cement plants or industry can develop optimal clinker quality standards on a quantitative basis to achieve low-carbon clinker. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The purpose of using a lower amount of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> in the concrete mix is to reduce the climate impact from the concrete. The thesis considers material testing and modelling of different concrete recipes with variation of the amount of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker.</b> Fly ash was used as the alternative binder. A total of five concrete mixes was tested. One mix with 100 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> was through laboratory testing compared to mixes with 85 % and 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> content. A concrete mix with only 50 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> was also tested, but this mix is today not allowed according to the concrete standards, but was included in the study to test different material properties of the fresh and hardened concrete. All concrete mixes were tested with the effectivity factor 1, except for the recipe with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker,</b> which was tested for effectivity factors of 1 and 0. 4. The performed study showed that the concrete mix 4 with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and with the effectivity factor 0. 4 reached the strength class C 35 / 45 after 28 days and also fulfilled the specified requirement of a maximum crack width of 0. 2 mm due to drying shrinkage and long-term loading. Water permeability test showed that the concrete mix with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and an effectivity factor of 0. 4 was waterproof. The concrete mix 3 with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and the effectivity factor 1 reached a strength class C 30 / 37. The concrete mix 1 with 100 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> obtained the highest strength class C 50 / 60 and the mix 2 with 85 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> reached strength class C 45 / 55. The concrete mix 5 with 50 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> reached the strength class C 20 / 25 which is the lowest strength class among the tested recipes. All the concrete recipes seemed to be waterproof according to the water permeability test. A background description of carbon dioxide emission from concrete and cement production is presented in the report. Research about ongoing methods to minimize the emission from concrete and cement industry is also summarized. FE-modelling with the software FEM-design and analytical calculations were performed to investigate the crack width due to drying shrinkage and long-term loading for the slab, for concrete mix 2 with 85 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> with effectivity factor 1 and mixes 3 and 4 with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and effectivity factors of 1 and 0. 4.

Results from FEM-design and analytical calculations showed that concrete mixes 3 and 4 with 70 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and effectivity factors of 1 and 0. 4, and the concrete mix 2 with 85 % <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> with effectivity factor 1, fulfilled the demand on crack width.

40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} if developed phase chemical process models for <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and lime production processes are reliable to use as predictive tools in understanding the changes when introducing sustainability measures. The thesis describes the development of process simulation models {{in the application of}} sustainability measures as well as the evaluation of these models. The motivation for developing these types of models arises from the need to predict the chemical and the process changes in the production process, the impact on the product quality and the emissions from the flue gas. The main chemical reactions involving the major elements (calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron) are relatively well known. As for the minor elements, such as sodium and potassium metals, sulphur, chlorine, phosphorus and other trace elements, their influence on the main reactions and the formation of clinker minerals is not entirely known. When the concentrations of minor and trace elements increase due to the use of alternative materials and fuels, a model that can accurately predict their chemistry is invaluable. For example, the shift towards using less carbon intensive fuels and more biomass fuels often leads to an increased phosphorus concentration in the products. One way to commit to sustainable development methods in <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and lime production is to use new combustion technologies, which increase the ability to capture carbon dioxide. Introducing oxy-fuel combustion achieves this, but at the same time, the overall process changes in many other ways. Some of these changes are evaluated by the models in this work. In this thesis, a combination of the software programs Aspen Plus™ and ChemApp™ constitutes the simulation model. Thermodynamic data from FACT are evaluated and adjusted to suit the chemistry of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and lime.

Within the lab research we prepared concrete mixtures for which we used three different types of cement. From each type of concrete we created three test pieces. All the other components of concrete were the same and added in the same proportion. We have produced specimens {{in the form of}} cubes with a side of 20 cm. The cube was inserted with a ribbed reinforcing bar with a diameter of 20 mm which was piercing the center of the cube. The pull- out test was conducted in accordance with standard SIST EN 10080 : 2005. We burdened the reinforcing bar with tensile until the contact between concrete and the reinforcing steel was broken. Used types of cement differed in the amount of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> and additives in the cement. Based on the research results we found that concretes using cement with a higher proportion of <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> achieve higher bond stresses between concrete and reinforcing steel. Increasing bond stresses are almost proportional to the increase of the <b>cement</b> <b>clinker</b> in <b>cement...</b>|$|R
