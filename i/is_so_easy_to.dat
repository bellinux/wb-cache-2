It is listed on schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention: All production sites manufacturing more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared to the OPCW. Although less dangerous than many other chemical weapons, such as sarin, phosgene is still regarded as a viable chemical warfare agent because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manufacture {{when compared to the}} production requirements of more technically advanced chemical weapons such as the first-generation nerve agent tabun.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell {{has stated}} that he feels hands are second only to heads in {{importance}} to {{the expression of a}} story. He stated with regards to Freedom of Worship, [...] "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over." [...] Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion [...] "is an extremely delicate subject. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hurt so many people's feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{contrary}} {{tendency is}} apparent in cultured and Greco-Latin technical vocabulary, which most Europeans see as [...] "international" [...] and therefore take into Esperanto en masse, despite the fact they are not truly universal. Many Asians consider this to be an onerous and unnecessary burden on the memory, when it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> derive equivalent words internally (for example by calquing them, which is what Chinese often does). This sparks frequent debates as to whether a particular root is justified, and sometimes results in duplicates of native and borrowed vocabulary. An example is [...] "calligraphy", which occurs both as a calqued belskribo ("writing of beauty") and as the direct borrowing kaligrafio. A similar development has also occurred in English (brotherly vs. fraternal), German (Ornithologie vs. Vogelkunde for ornithology), Japanese (beesubooru vs. yakyuu for baseball), Spanish (básquetbol vs. baloncesto for basketball), French (le week-end vs. la fin de semaine), and other languages. However, although the debates in ethnic languages are motivated by nationalism or issues of cultural identity, in Esperanto the debates are largely motivated by differing views {{on how to make}} the language practical and accessible.|$|E
