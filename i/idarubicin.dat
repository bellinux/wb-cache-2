50|$|The {{first is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as random collection and screening of material, but in fact the collection is often far from random in that biological (often botanical) knowledge is used about which families show promise, based on a number of factors, including past screening. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} only a small part of earth’s biodiversity has ever been tested for pharmaceutical activity. It is also based on the fact that organisms living in a species-rich environment need to evolve defensive and competitive mechanisms to survive, mechanisms which might usefully be exploited in the development of drugs that can cure diseases affecting humans. A collection of plant, animal and microbial samples from rich ecosystems can potentially give rise to novel biological activities worth exploiting in the drug development process. One example of a successful use of this strategy is the screening for antitumour agents by the National Cancer Institute, started in the 1960s. Paclitaxel was identified from Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia. Paclitaxel showed anti-tumour activity by a previously undescribed mechanism (stabilization of microtubules) and is now approved for clinical use for the treatment of lung, breast and ovarian cancer, as well as for Kaposi's sarcoma. Early in the 21st century, Cabazitaxel (made by Sanofi, a French firm), another relative of taxol has been shown effective against prostate cancer, also because it works by preventing the formation of microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart in dividing cells (such as cancer cells). Other examples are: 1. Camptotheca (Camptothecin · Topotecan · Irinotecan · Rubitecan · Belotecan); 2. Podophyllum (Etoposide · Teniposide); 3a. Anthracyclines (Aclarubicin · Daunorubicin · Doxorubicin · Epirubicin · <b>Idarubicin</b> · Amrubicin · Pirarubicin · Valrubicin · Zorubicin); 3b. Anthracenediones (Mitoxantrone · Pixantrone).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{present in}} vitro loading and release {{characteristics}} of <b>idarubicin</b> with ONCOZENE (CeloNova BioSciences, Inc, San Antonio, Texas) drug-eluting embolic (DEE) agents and in vivo pharmacokinetics data after transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents {{in patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Loading efficacy of <b>idarubicin</b> with ONCOZENE DEE agents 100 µm and DC Bead (Biocompatibles UK Ltd, Farnham, United Kingdom) DEE agents 100 - 300 µm was monitored at 10, 20, and 30 minutes loading time by high-pressure liquid chromatography. A T-apparatus was used to monitor the release of <b>idarubicin</b> from {{the two types of}} DEE agents over 12 hours. Clinical and 24 -hour pharmacokinetics data were recorded after transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents in four patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. RESULTS: <b>Idarubicin</b> loading in ONCOZENE DEE agents was > 99 % at 10 minutes. Time to reach 75 % of the release plateau level was 37 minutes ± 6 for DC Bead DEE agents and 170 minutes ± 19 for ONCOZENE DEE agents both loaded with <b>idarubicin</b> 10 mg/mL. After transarterial chemoembolization with idarubicin-loaded ONCOZENE DEE agents, three partial responses and one complete response were observed with only two asymptomatic grade 3 biologic adverse events. Median time to maximum concentration for <b>idarubicin</b> in patients was 10 minutes, and mean maximum concentration was 4. 9 µg/L ± 1. 7.

Cell death by apoptosis caused by <b>idarubicin</b> treatment was confirmed by Hoechst 33258  staining. Further proliferation was explored by cell counting and by 3 H-thymidine uptake. Protein synthesis was measured by 3 H-proline uptake and motility was assessed by agarose droplet motility assay.  RESULTS—Idarubicin is able to exert toxicity and to induce apoptosis during a short time exposure of 0. 5  minutes at concentrations of 0. 3 - 1 µg/ml resulting in a significant reduction in cell number compared with the control after 60  days. For mitomycin C, higher concentrations and longer expositions were necessary. Even after treatment with 1  µg/ml <b>idarubicin</b> or 250  µg/ml mitomycin C a few cells were able to incorporate 3 H-thymidine. 3 H-proline uptake up to 10  days after exposure to 0. 3  µg/ml <b>idarubicin</b> was found not to be decreased. Cell motility was reduced after treatment with 1  µg/ml <b>idarubicin</b> for 5  minutes or with 250  µg/ml mitomycin C for 2  or 5  minutes. For low mitomycin C concentrations, an increase in motility was found during the first 10  days.  CONCLUSION—Idarubicin reduces proliferation of human Tenons's capsule fibroblasts after incubation for 0. 5  minutes at concentrations as low as 0. 3 - 1 µg/ml. In comparison, mitomycin C requires longer exposure times and higher doses for equal results. Therefore, <b>idarubicin</b> may be useful in the prevention of glaucoma filtering surgery failure. ...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the DSHNHL {{performed}} the CIVEP- 14 trial that incorporated <b>idarubicin</b> instead of doxorubicin within the CHOEP- 14 regimen {{in an attempt}} to further increase the intensity and efficacy of dose-dense chemotherapy without increasing toxicity. We hypothesized that in the study by Zinzani et al. doxorubicin had not been replaced with an equivalent (equitoxic) dose of <b>idarubicin</b> and that therefore efficacy could not be assessed correctly. We decided to use an equitoxic dose of CIVEP (compared to CHOEP) as the endpoint of the phase I/II trial. In addition, since continuous intravenous application of etoposide (Wilson et al. 1993) has been postulated to decrease toxicity in comparison to the standard bolus infusion, a prospective evaluation of c.i.v. etoposide was integrated into the CIVEP-trial. The aim of the CIVEP- 14 phase I/II trial was therefore to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of <b>idarubicin</b> equitoxic to 50  mg/m 2 doxorubicin by replacing doxorubicin with <b>idarubicin</b> in escalating dose levels in the standard CHOEP- 14 regimen. A novel, modified Storer (Storer 1989) up-and-down algorithm was used to determine the MTD of <b>idarubicin</b> defined by pre-set criteria. At the highest <b>idarubicin</b> dose, etoposide application was switched from a bolus to a continuous intravenous application. We here report long-term follow up data with a median observation time for overall survival of 9 years. These data were subsequently compared with long-term follow-up data from the NHL B 1 / 2 trials in a matched pair analysis. Even though the <b>idarubicin</b> dose could be escalated by 50 %, our analysis shows a better long-term outcome with less toxicity for pts treated with standard CHOEP- 14.|$|E

Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was reduced in the idarubicin-treated group (P< 0. 05). Glutathione peroxidase levels were decreased in the idarubicin-treated group (P< 0. 05) and reached maximum concentrations in the catechin- and catechin + idarubicin-treated groups compared to control (P< 0. 01).

Five-year results in both treatment arms were similar (overall survival 76 % ± 3 % [L-DNR] vs 75 % ± 3 % [idarubicin], Plogrank =. 65; event-free survival [EFS] 59 % ± 3 % vs 53 % ± 3 %, Plogrank =. 25; cumulative incidence of relapse 29 % ± 3 % vs 31 % ± 3 %, P(Gray) =. 75), as were EFS results for standard (72 % ± 5 % vs 68 % ± 5 %, Plogrank =. 47) and high-risk (51 % ± 4 % vs 46 % ± 4 %, Plogrank =. 45) patients. L-DNR resulted in significantly better probability of EFS in patients with t(8; 21). Overall, treatment-related mortality was lower with L-DNR than <b>idarubicin</b> (2 / 257 vs 10 / 264 patients, P =. 04). Grade 3 / 4 cardiotoxicity was rare after induction (4 L-DNR vs 5 <b>idarubicin).</b> Only 1 L-DNR and 3 <b>idarubicin</b> patients presented with subclinical or mild cardiomyopathy during follow-up. In conclusion, at the given dose, L-DNR has overall antileukemic activity comparable to <b>idarubicin,</b> promises to be more active in subgroups, and causes less treatment-related mortality.
