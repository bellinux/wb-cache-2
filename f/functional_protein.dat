5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a <b>functional</b> <b>protein</b> may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
25|$|An Amorph (gene), a term {{utilized}} by Muller in 1932, is a mutated allele, which {{has lost the}} ability of the parent (whether wild type or any other type) allele to encode any <b>functional</b> <b>protein.</b> An amorphic mutation may be caused by the replacement of an amino acid that deactivates an enzyme or by the deletion of part of a gene that produces the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{performing}} a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The sequence space for random sequence is vast (10130 possible sequences for a 100 amino acid protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental, nor natural evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to <b>functional</b> <b>protein</b> sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{laboratory}} {{evolution of}} <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> holds great fascination {{as an effective}} tool for searching and discovering novelty in the protein space. Here, we employ a simple molecular approach for generating a multitude of structurally diverse yet functionally similar proteins that have all “evolved” from the parent enzyme, {{in this case a}} β-lactamase. By randomly combining a set of 14 DNA-hexamer duplexes, each corresponding to judiciously chosen amino acid pairs, we were able to generate <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> that contained large regions of previously unknown sequences. Some of the generated proteins were not only more active than the parent, they were also significantly smaller in size. Our approach could therefore be effectively used in searching for novel structural as well as <b>functional</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> {{was not born}} until the 1950 s and, initially, the only commercially-produced <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> were merely dried fresh foods, for example dried egg white and non-fat dried milk. These {{products}} were similar to their fresh counterparts and no attempt was made in food industry to purify or fractionate proteins. The use of purified proteins was first achieved in other industries. For example, casein had been produced for many years piror to its isolation for food usage for plastic production and paper coating. The production of <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> accelerated in 1960 s with the production of soya isolate and sodium caseinate. In the case of soya, food grade protein production was an alternative to selling as animal feed the resulting from oil pressing/extraction (Smith and Circle, 1978). For caseinate, major advances {{were made in the}} design of plant, which made feasible the production of high-grade edible quality products (Muller, 1982). Twenty years later, soya proteins and caseinates are used in a vast range of food products from bakery to meat and artificial dairy products, and can now be called the first generation of <b>functional</b> <b>proteins.</b> Soya proteins, caseinates and dried egg white are now regarded as the standard functional protein; between them they perform well all the major functional properties, and all nove...|$|R

The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of sepsis, and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment.

25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase. It can be inferred from the results that the increase in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized that the increase in copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced <b>functional</b> <b>protein.</b> In addition, it was speculated that the increase in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background SARS {{coronavirus}} (SARS-CoV) {{was identified}} as the etiological agent of SARS, and extensive investigations indicated that it originated from an animal source (probably bats) and was recently introduced into the human population via wildlife animals from wet markets in southern China. Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. Results We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly {{in the middle and}} late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. Conclusion This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different <b>functional</b> <b>proteins</b> of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts. These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events. </p...|$|R
