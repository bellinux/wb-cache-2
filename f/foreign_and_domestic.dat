5|$|Construction of {{the system}} took more than 2,000 {{professional}} engineers from 20 countries and over 20,000 <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> workers six years to complete. Construction work was broken into several specialized lots that were contracted separately. One group of contracts was for civil works, covering {{the construction of the}} superstructure of open line sections. Stations and depots were the subject of separate groups of construction lots.

While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E

Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} effects of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) on the wage gap between <b>foreign</b> firms <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> firms in the host country, we use data from Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database to measure these effects. Theoretical {{results show that the}} wage gap between <b>foreign</b> firms <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> firms in the host country caused by the FDI labor transfer effect and technology spillover effect tends to increase then decrease, which implies an inverted U curve track. The empirical results show that the FDI has significant effects on the wage gap in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) during the observed time period. The contribution of the FDI to change of the wage gap is above 10 %, which is in the second position among all observed factors. From the overall point of view, the contribution of the FDI tends to decrease. The reason is that the wage gap caused by the FDI has stepped into the decreasing stage. This means the wage gap between <b>foreign</b> firms <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> firms currently has been on {{the latter part of the}} inverted U curve. The Chinese government should expand fields for FDI so as to decrease the wage gap between <b>foreign</b> firms <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> firms. This policy implication should be helpful for the PRC to step over the “middle-income trap”...|$|R
5|$|Historical sources {{confirm that}} the Macedonian kings before Philip II at least upheld the {{privileges}} and responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, initiating the kingdom's foreign policies, and negotiating deals such as alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480 BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> parties with impressive gifts.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E

5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|The first {{traces of}} large nobility {{meetings}} in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{can be found in}} the Treaty of Salynas of 1398 and the Union of Horodło of 1413. It is considered that the first Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Lithuanian Council of Lords. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged the country almost continuously between 1492 and 1582, the Grand Duke needed more tax revenues to finance the army and had to call the Seimas more frequently. In exchange for cooperation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening of the Seimas. At first the Seimas did not have the legislative power. It would debate on <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> affairs, taxes, wars, state budget. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Seimas acquired some legislative powers. The Seimas could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws.|$|E
5|$|The minting {{of silver}} coinage began {{during the reign}} of AlexanderI as a means to pay for royal expenditures. ArchelausI {{increased}} the silver content of his coins as well as minting copper coins to promote <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> commerce. The minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of PhilipII and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Kingdom of Pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon produced standard coins. The right to mint coins was shared by central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth. The Macedonians were also the first to issue different coins for internal and external circulation.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} role of branding and design {{in the process of}} city/nation identity creation. Recently, there are a growing phenomenon of branding within cities and/or nations. The growing competition between cities {{to increase the number of}} visitors <b>and</b> investors, <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> <b>domestics,</b> <b>and</b> develop new businesses which in turn could absorb talents and manpowers was the background for the phenomenon. With the development of branding awareness, more and more cities/nations commit to a branding strategy so that they can measure the journey of their city/nation branding. This article began with a number of basic definitions about the city/nation branding concept; and then was followed by the case studies. The sources for this paper are derived from books and journals, the author 2 ̆ 7 s travelling experiences, and articles from the internet regarding the city branding and city tourism...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} of <b>foreign</b> exchange <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> asset markets imposes fiscal costs on governments which are net purchasers of foreign currency {{from the private}} sector and net borrowers from the financial system. Fiscal costs increase if liberalization also induces the private sector to reduce domestic money balances in favor of <b>foreign</b> currency <b>and</b> <b>domestic</b> interest-bearing assets. The substitution out of domestic money reduces seigniorage revenue accruing to government and, unless offsetting fiscal adjustment can be made, will often lead to accelerating inflation. This paper presents a model of inflation and financial liberalization applied to recent stabilization experiences in Zambia to illustrate the fiscal and inflationary consequences of financial liberalization implemented prior to the achievement of fiscal balance...|$|R
