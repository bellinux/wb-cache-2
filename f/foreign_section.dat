Sisson returned to the US in May and became head of the CPI's <b>Foreign</b> <b>Section</b> in July 1918. His report describing the documents reached Wilson on May 9, 1918, and the administration released them to the American press on September 15. Most of the press reported without question that the German General Staff had hired Lenin and Trotsky and disredited the Russian revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|After his election, he made Luigi Maglione his {{successor}} as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished {{diplomatic relations with}} Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later Pope Paul VI) and Domenico Tardini. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its <b>foreign</b> <b>section</b> and Montini head of the internal section. Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals, an honor which both turned down. They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia. Tardini {{continued to be a}} close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of Milan, after the death of Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.|$|E
2500|$|The service {{derived from}} the Secret Service Bureau, {{which was founded in}} 1909. The Bureau was a joint {{initiative}} of the Admiralty and the War Office to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the Imperial German government. [...] The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the Imperial German Navy. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the First World War in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the <b>foreign</b> <b>section</b> became the section MI1(c) of the Directorate of Military Intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Soviet Union made {{repeated}} {{efforts to}} reestablish closer contacts with Germany. The Soviets chiefly sought to repay debts from earlier trade with raw materials, while Germany sought to rearm, and the countries signed a credit agreement in 1935. In 1936, the Soviets attempted to seek closer political ties to Germany {{along with an}} additional credit agreement, which were rebuffed by Hitler, who wished {{to steer clear of}} such political ties. [...] In response to Stalin's hopes to complete an economic deal with Hitler, the <b>foreign</b> <b>section</b> of the NKVD warned him that [...] "all Soviet attempts to appease and conciliate Hitler are doomed. The main obstacle to an understanding with Moscow is Hitler himself." [...] Stalin did not agree, responding to the NKVD [...] "Well, now, how can Hitler make war on us when he has granted such loans? [...] It's impossible. The business circles in Germany are too powerful, and they are in the saddle." ...|$|E

He reported to the Post Office Secretary's Office on 27 September 1799 that: the mails are both delivered which I assure you is not so easy or businesslike as I imagined it would be, for although the letters are partly sorted in London to the different regiments, there are still a great number for persons not attached to any regiment who are so impatient to be supplied that immediately a mail arrives I am beset by at least a hundred of them. Great confusion is occasioned also by officers detached from the regiment to which their letters were addressed insisting on looking for them before the Drum Majors were appointed Post Orderlies for each regiment get them.|$|E
