40|$|This study {{measures}} the economic consequences of information security activities, in general, {{and more specifically}} the market value <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> information security activities. Since information security activities are primarily non-revenue generating, management tends to view them as the cost-of-doing-business, with no impact on firm value. Furthermore, managers are reluctant to share the details, because {{that they do not}} want to attract the attention of hackers. However, voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> information security can help reduce information asymmetry, which leads to belief revisions by investors, and hence corrects the misspecifications (if any) of the firm’s market value. In other words, voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> security activities are signaling mechanisms. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> information security activities, and empirically test the value relevance <b>of</b> such <b>disclosures.</b> Based on a sample of 1, 637 disclosing firms, the empirical results provide support for the argument that voluntary <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> information security activities are value-relevant. Industry-wide analyses support the disclosure taxonomy developed, and highlight that firms which are technology an...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the topic of}} {{children and young people}}’s <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> abuse.

Most research into children and young people’s disclosures has focused on <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> child sexual abuse, however, many of the issues canvassed are also likely to be relevant to <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> other types of abuse (i. e., physical, psychological and emotional abuse).

Nevertheless, the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> the treaty placed the issue of Texas annexation {{at the center of the}} 1844 general election.|$|E

The information from that prior device could not be used, however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged that federal government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> all such secretly planted devices.|$|E

Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
