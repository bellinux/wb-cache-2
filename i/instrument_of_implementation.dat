40|$|The {{quest for}} a “high” level of {{environmental}} protection 1 in the European Union (EU) {{is dependent on the}} successful implementation and enforcement of EU legislation by Member States. Thus, {{despite the fact that the}} Community did not originally have a mandate to impose the choice of <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of Community Law on Member States, the decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of 13 September 2005 (Case C- 176 / 03 Commission v Council) has finally established that while the Community does not have competence in criminal matters per se, the Community institutions may require Member States to introduce criminal sanctions for the protection of the environment. The ECJ has therefore annulled a Framework Decision of the Council which aimed at harmonising the criminal sanctions for protection of the environment of Member States under the third pillar of the EU, rather than the first pillar (which allows the Commission and ECJ to exercise stronger enforcement powers). These developments demonstrate that for the first time a supranational institution may be able effectively to enforce an obligation on national authorities to enact penal sanctions for environmental protection. The objective of this paper will be to discuss whether the harmonisation of environmental criminal standards may lead to better environmental protection within the EU...|$|E

40|$|This work aims {{to reflect}} on the power of the law as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of {{institutional}} objectives associated with the biodiesel policies in Brazil. Methodologically, the study used bibliographic and documentary research. The main conclusions are that there are aspects that go beyond the legal field which directly influence the normative teleology, such as the conflict of interests in the legislative process. The law about biodiesel presents antinomies and gaps, which are the cause of the failure of the National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel, aimed to promote the social improvement of the Brazilian familiar agriculture. Therefore, the transversality of the law, mainly from the National Energy Policy, did not have the expected effect on instrumental rules of public policy proposals for the sector. There is a need in the legal field to dialogue with other fields of knowledge, in order to incorporate other factors than the law in its application in the real world. Objetiva-se refletir sobre o poder da norma jurídica como instrumento de concretização dos objetivos institucionais associados às políticas do biodiesel no Brasil. Metodologicamente, o estudo ancora-se em pesquisa bibliográfica e documental. Concluiu-se que há aspectos que extrapolam o campo jurídico que influenciam diretamente na teleologia normativa, como o conflito de interesses no processo legislativo. A norma jurídica sobre o biodiesel apresenta antinomias e lacunas, que são a causa do insucesso do Programa Nacional de Produção e Uso de Biodiesel, voltado a fomentar a melhoria social da agricultura familiar brasileira. Por isso, a transversalidade da norma, proveniente principalmente da Política Energética Nacional, não surtiu o efeito esperado nas normas instrumentais das políticas públicas propostas para o setor.

40|$|The {{problems}} {{of climate change}} significantly alter the character of urban planning. While changes in the planning process are aimed at mechanisms for urgent action in the transformed circumstances {{in the sense of}} a deeper understanding of the causes of phenomena and prediction of future changes, modification of specific measures suppose to be related to the regulatory framework for new and existing construction that will lead to reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and the development of resistance to settlements' extreme impacts. The focus has shifted to land-use planning and the development and application of building regulations. It is considered that planning at the local level is an appropriate instrument for solving the problem of climate impacts in the community. In general, urban planning is an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> of national strategies for mitigation and adaptation at the local level. Successful implementation of the strategy is based on a developed vertical and horizontal institutional and procedural coordination. In the circumstances of specific context of post-socialist urban restructuring, which is characterized by a lack of developed institutions and appropriate procedures, it is difficult to expect the entire application of prescribed procedures and harmonization of vertical and horizontal spatial development policies. Accordingly, it is recommended that policies be aimed at short-term improvements that are based on existing climate risk management and short-term projections of climate impacts. Among the main recommendations of the regional climate change adaptation strategies related to policy-makers in the field of urban development is to establish new and efficient use of existing legislation in the field of environment and planning. It is believed that most countries in the region have adequate legislation and efforts should be directed towards more effective implementation of existing planning and building regulations especially in areas exposed to climate impacts. In the absence of a national strategy of adaptation to climate change, urban planning guidelines could be determined by comparative analysis of regional recommendations in the field of urban planning and the existing legislative framework in Serbia...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and use of the conceptual framework of ecosystem services (ES) has been very successful in supporting the broad diffusion and application of ES within science and policy communities. However, most of the currently proposed interpretations of the framework neither correlate to environmental planning nor to decision-making contexts at the local and regional scale, which is a potential reason for the slow adoption and practice of the ES conceptual framework. This paper proposes a practice-oriented ES evaluation (PRESET) model specifically adapted to the requirements of local and regional planning and decision-making contexts, and discusses its potential benefits and implications for practice. Through the usage of PRESET we suggest making a distinction between 'offered ES', 'utilized ES', 'human input', and 'ES benefits' as relevant information for decision-making. Furthermore, we consider it important to link these decision-support categories to different value dimensions relevant in planning and management practice. PRESET provides guidance to inject the ES concept into planning, but needs to be implemented together with concrete assessment methods, indicators and data. The planning strategic benefits of using PRESET include its reference to existing legislative objectives, avoiding the risk that monetized ES values might dominate decision-making, clarification of human contributions, and easier identification of land use conflicts and synergies. Examples are given for offered and utilized ES, as well as for respective evaluation approaches and <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} an institutionalization of public actors {{and forms of}} their {{interaction}} in contemporary post-modern political space has been analyzed in the article. New tendencies of their subjectivity’s change concerning {{the formation of the}} public equity in various types of the modes have been considered: hybridization, individualization, cross-border, conflict and the transformation of the network entities. Information technologies has become to be one <b>of</b> the main <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> public policy in modern political conditions, which, in the long term, can be considered as a basis for a transformation of political systems of all types. Change of roles of political subjects is connected with such sociocultural characteristic of the present stage of society’s development as individualization. The individualized subject is in a constant process of formation of their own identity and they look for valuable grounds and orientations in behavioral practice using mechanisms of identification and socialization. Consequently, the social positioning of the individual, identification of individual with the interests and values happens. Change in nature of identity and political culture shows the importance of the following tendency in political practice as a hybridism. Today {{there are a lot of}} examples of a hybridism: hybrid modes, states, batches, etc. Interactions between actors of public policy get more and more nonhierarchical nature and the value of horizontal negotiation network model increases. Various forms of transitional states created the same variety of national public ones. For the public policy in transformed states the most actual are such problems as: imitating nature, institutional uncertainty, conflict, institutional “traps”. The key mechanism of the political practice of development of actors is the conversion of different types of resources into the public equity, which is a part of the political equity. The public actors that act in specific institutional regime frameworks possess the incorporated capability to participate in collective and individual actions. This participation is based on their interests, preferences and identity. It has been shown in the article that public actors, which act in a certain environment regime, create special forms of the public equity which reflect efficiency rate, openness and level of conflict of the political system...|$|R
40|$|Background High-quality {{measurement}} {{is critical}} to advancing knowledge in any field. New fields, such as implementation science, are often beset with measurement gaps and poor quality instruments, a weakness that can be more easily addressed in light of systematic review findings. Although several reviews <b>of</b> quantitative <b>instruments</b> used in implementation science have been published, no {{studies have focused on}} instruments that measure implementation outcomes. Proctor and colleagues established a core set <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> outcomes including: acceptability, adoption,appropriateness, cost, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, sustainability (Adm Policy Ment Health Ment Health Serv Res 36 : 24 – 34, 2009). The Society for Implementation Research Collaboration (SIRC) Instrument Review Project employed an enhanced systematic review methodology (Implement Sci 2 : 2015) to identify quantitative <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>implementation</b> outcomes relevant to mental or behavioral health settings. Methods Full details of the enhanced systematic review methodology are available (Implement Sci 2 : 2015). To increase the feasibility of the review, and consistent with the scope <b>of</b> SIRC, only <b>instruments</b> that were applicable to mental or behavioral health were included. The review, synthesis, and evaluation included the following: (1) a search protocol for the literature review of constructs; (2) the literature review <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> using Web <b>of</b> Science and PsycINFO; and (3) data extraction and instrument quality ratings to inform knowledge synthesis. Our evidence-based assessment rating criteria quantified fundamental psychometric properties as well as a crude measure of usability. Two independent raters applied the evidence-based assessment rating criteria to each instrument to generate a quality profile. Results We identified 104 instruments across eight constructs, with nearly half (n[*]=[*] 50) assessingacceptability and 19 identified for adoption, with all other implementation outcomes revealing fewer than 10 instruments. Only one instrument demonstrated at least minimal evidence for psychometric strength on all six of the evidence-based assessment criteria. The majority <b>of</b> <b>instruments</b> had no information regarding responsiveness or predictive validity. Conclusions Implementation outcomes instrumentation is underdeveloped with respect to both the sheer number <b>of</b> available <b>instruments</b> and the psychometric quality <b>of</b> existing <b>instruments.</b> Until psychometric strength is established, the field will struggle to identify which implementation strategies work best, for which organizations, and under what conditions...|$|R
