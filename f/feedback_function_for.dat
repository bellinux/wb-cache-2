40|$|Finding a {{theoretically}} sound <b>feedback</b> <b>function</b> <b>for</b> variable-interval schedules {{remains an}} important unsolved problem. It {{is important because}} interval schedules model a significant feature of the world: the dependence of reinforcement on factors beyond the organism's control. The problem remains unsolved because no feedback function yet proposed satisfies all the theoretical and empirical requirements. Previous suggestions that succeed in fitting data fail theoretically because they violate a newly recognized theoretical requirement: The slope of the function must approach or equal 1. 0 at the origin. A function is presented that satisfies all requirements but lacks any theoretical justification. This function and two suggested by Prelec and Herrnstein (1978) and Nevin and Baum (1980) are evaluated against several sets of data. All three fitted the data well. The success of the two theoretically incorrect functions raises an empirical puzzle: Low rates of reinforcement are coupled with response rates that seem anomalously high. It remains to be discovered what this reflects about the temporal patterning of operant behavior at low reinforcement rates. A theoretically and empirically correct function derived from basic assumptions about operant behavior also remains to be discovered...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE) in a data {{recovery}} channel filters the bit {{decision in the}} current symbol period in generating the sample at the comparator in the subsequent clock period. The operations of sampling, comparing, filtering the decision bits into a feedback signal, and subtraction of that feedback signal are cascaded, thereby establishing the critical timing path. Thus, this system, though simple, requires its components to have large bandwidths {{in order to achieve}} the high-speed response necessary to perform the described <b>feedback</b> <b>function.</b> <b>For</b> the entire system to run at speeds comparable to those of competing technologies (100 MHz to 250 MHz), the components must have bandwidths greater than 100 MHz, and work together to provide a loop bandwidth of at least 100 MHz. A 300 MHz latching comparator and a 125 MHz 6 -bit current-DAC were designed in a 5 V, 1 um CMOS n-well process for use in a DFE loop. Both blocks are fully differential and achieve an accuracy of 1 / 2 LSB (10 uA) over a differential signal range of 1. 28 mA. This is true for their operations at speed, in isolated simulation and as contiguous blocks. The DAC power consumption is relatively high at 23 mW, due to internal switching circuits which require a static current, but the comparator's power consumption is minimal at 5 mW...|$|E

50|$|The core {{accumulator}} in VEST ciphers {{can be seen}} as a SPN constructed using non-linear 6-to-1 <b>feedback</b> <b>functions,</b> one <b>for</b> each bit, all {{of which}} are updated simultaneously. The VEST-4 core accumulator is illustrated below: It accepts 10 bits (d0 &minus; d9) as its input. The least significant five bits (p0 &minus; p4) in the accumulator state are updated by a 5×5 substitution box and linearly combined with the first five input bits on each round. The next five accumulator bits are linearly combined with the next five input bits and with a non-linear function of four of the less significant accumulator bits. In authenticated encryption mode, the ciphertext feedback bits are also linearly fed back into the accumulator (e0 &minus; e3) with a non-linear function of four of the less significant accumulator bits. All the other bits in the VEST accumulator state are linearly combined with non-linear functions of five less significant bits of the accumulator state on each round. The use of only the less significant bits as inputs into the <b>feedback</b> <b>functions</b> <b>for</b> each bit is typical of T-functions and is responsible for the feedback bijectivity. This substitution operation is followed by a pseudorandom transposition of all the bits in the state (see picture below).|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{quantify}} the recovery of spinal reflexes at the elbow after neurosurgical intervention in patients with brachial plexus injuries. So far, main focus was on the recovery of muscle force and little on sensory- and reflex system. As reflexes play an important role during normal movement, it is of interest to determine to what extend reflexes have been restored after surgery. Arm admittance (dynamic relationship between displacements in a response to forces) at endpoint level (hand) was estimated using force perturbations in two directions (horizontal) applied by a two-joint robotic manipulator. Three different task instructions were used to provoke different intrinsic and reflexive behavior, being a position task (PT), a relax task (RT) and a force task (FT) where the subject was required to minimize hand displacements, not react to the perturbations and minimize force deviations (being compliant) respectively. Ten patients with brachial plexus lesions participated in this experiment and were suffering from varying degrees of arm dysfunction. All had successful recovery for the biceps (MRC grade 3 and higher) after surgical nerve repair of the n. musculocutaneous. Estimated intrinsic and reflexive parameters were compared to those of a control group (n = 10, age and sex matched). The task instructions had great influence on the admittance, especially between the PT and RT. In all patients, reflexive activity was found corresponding to assumed muscle spindles (velocity- and position feedback) and Golgi tendon organ (force <b>feedback)</b> <b>function.</b> <b>For</b> the PT, the difference in parameters between patients and control subjects was largest. Overall, patients exhibit more intrinsic stiffness at the shoulder and elbow than the control subjects, an indication of co-contraction, and less reflexive feedback at the elbow. There are two possible explanations for this: 1) The intrinsic and reflexive properties did not recover to the combination as before the injury and are not cooperating correctly, and 2) The patients are relying more on intrinsic control than on reflexive control (different control strategy). Whereas the control group uses an energy efficient approach, i. e. less intrinsic and more reflex activity, the patients appear to use a more maximal activation approach resulting in co-contraction. It is possible that the exercises performed during rehabilitation which focus on muscle force do not provoke enough reflexive behavior. More research, e. g. experiments that are designed to disable co-contraction, is needed to verify if the use of co-contraction is learnt or a necessity. Conclusion: reflexes do recover after surgery to severe Brachial plexus injuries, the amount of reflex function is less or less effective than for the control group.

40|$|Single-channel speech dereverberation is a {{challenging}} problem of deconvolution of reverberation, {{produced by the}} room impulse response, from the speech signal, when only one observation of the reverberant signal (one microphone) is available. Although reverberation in mild levels is helpful in perceiving the speech (or any audio) signal, the adverse effect of reverberation, particularly at high levels, could both deteriorate the performance of automatic recognition systems and make it less intelligible by humans. Single-microphone speech dereverberation is more challenging than multi-microphone speech dereverberation, since it {{does not allow for}} spatial processing of different observations of the signal. A review of the recent single-channel dereverberation techniques reveals that, those based on LP-residual enhancement are the most promising ones. On the other hand, spectral subtraction has also been effectively used for dereverberation particularly when long reflections are involved. By using LP-residuals and spectral subtraction as two promising tools for dereverberation, a new dereverberation technique is proposed. The first stage of the proposed technique consists of pre-whitening followed by a delayed long-term LP filtering whose kurtosis or skewness of LP-residuals is maximized to control the weight updates of the inverse filter. The second stage consists of nonlinear spectral subtraction. The proposed two-stage dereverberation scheme leads to two separate algorithms depending on whether kurtosis or skewness maximization is used to establish a <b>feedback</b> <b>function</b> <b>for</b> the weight updates of the adaptive inverse filter. It is shown that the proposed algorithms have several advantages over the existing major single-microphone methods, including a reduction in both early and late reverberations, speech enhancement even in the case of very high reverberation time, robustness to additive background noise, and introducing only a few minor artifacts. Equalized room impulse responses by the proposed algorithms have less reverberation times. This means the inverse-filtering by the proposed algorithms is more successful in dereverberating the speech signal. For short, medium and high reverberation times, the signal-to-reverberation ratio of the proposed technique is significantly higher than that of the existing major algorithms. The waveforms and spectrograms of the inverse-filtered and fully-processed signals indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithms. Assessment of the overall quality of the processed speech signals by automatic speech recognition and perceptual evaluation of speech quality test also confirms that in most cases the proposed technique yields higher scores and in the cases that it does not do so, the difference is not as significant as the other aspects of the performance evaluation. Finally, the robustness of the proposed algorithms against the background noise is investigated and compared to that of the benchmark algorithms, which shows that the proposed algorithms are capable of maintaining a rather stable performance for contaminated speech signals with SNR levels as low as 0 dB. ...|$|E

However, the variations in amplitude of the oscillation of the error signals cannot be evaded during the transmission of a chaotic signal, which actually determines the amount of energy to transmit the chaotic signals from transmitter to receiver. Likewise, the time response is an important feature in real-time applications such as communication networks as they depend on the time synchronization between different nodes [29]. Furthermore, in [18 – 22], the unknown parameters are assumed to be constant and the chaotic systems are considered free of the unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances. These perturbations are not integrated into the system dynamics altogether due to the analytical and computational stability complications. In the presence of these perturbations, the closed-loop for chaos synchronization may lose the synchronization stability completely.|$|R

In Experiment 1, 3 pigeons earned their daily food ration by choosing, in 30 -min sessions, between concurrent variable-ratio 30 variable-interval 40 -s schedules. Food presentations during both schedules lasted 2 or 12 s, depending upon the condition. Relative variable-ratio response rate was inversely related to hopper duration. In Experiment 2, 4 pigeons received their daily feeding by responding on the same schedule pair as in Experiment 1 (with 4 -s food presentations) in sessions that varied in length from 10 to 30 min, depending on the condition. The length of a vertical slit projected on a response key increased with time so that “passage of time” might be more easily discriminable.
