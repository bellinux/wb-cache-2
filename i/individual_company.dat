5|$|In Scotland, the Saltire can {{be flown}} {{at any time}} by any <b>individual,</b> <b>company,</b> local authority, {{hospital}} or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.|$|E

25|$|The National Rail {{network is}} mostly outside {{the control of}} Transport for London, and {{passenger}} services are run by number of independent rail companies. Because of this, acceptance of Oyster PAYG on National Rail services was subject to the policy of each <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> and the roll-out of PAYG was much slower than on TfL services. For the first six years of Oyster, rollout on National Rail was gradual and uneven, with validity limited to specific lines and stations.|$|E

25|$|A {{major factor}} in the merger was that when UHF {{transmission}} was introduced in 1969 to accommodate colour television {{it was found that the}} key Bilsdale transmitting station in North Yorkshire so dominated the territories of both companies that its allotment to either <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> would have seriously prejudiced the coverage and sales revenue of the other. The ITA agreed that Tyne Tees and Yorkshire could be considered as one company for the purposes of selling airtime, while expressing their individual identities in their programming output.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 150 city bus lines called Colectivos, each one managed by an <b>individual</b> <b>company.</b> These compete with each other, and attract {{exceptionally}} high use {{with virtually no}} public financial support. Their frequency makes them equal to the underground systems of other cities, but buses cover a far wider area than the underground system. Colectivos in Buenos Aires {{do not have a}} fixed timetable, but run from four to several per hour, depending on the bus line and time of the day. With inexpensive tickets and extensive routes, usually no further than four blocks from commuters' residences, the colectivo is the most popular mode of transport around the city.|$|E
25|$|Benchmarking {{has been}} {{undertaken}} {{for a long}} period by German utilities, but not in a comprehensive and systematic manner. In 1998 the Federal Ministry of Education and Research initiated a competition of ideas to reduce the costs of water supply together with the economic research institute RWI and 14 water utilities. It developed a set of criteria to assess strengths and weaknesses in the industry. Participating utilities say that they reduced their operating costs by about 5 percent after two to three years. The professional associations DVGW and DWA have jointly established a voluntary benchmarking system, which keeps <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> data confidential. The associations consider the system as being highly successful.|$|E

25|$|The other {{approach}} is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat {{more effective than the}} harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so {{that they will not be}} put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.|$|E
25|$|With $18.8 million {{spent in}} 2013, Comcast has the seventh largest {{lobbying}} budget of any <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> or {{organization in the}} United States. Comcast employs multiple former US Congressmen as lobbyists. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association, which has multiple Comcast executives on its board, also represents Comcast and other cable companies as the fifth largest lobbying organization in the United States, spending $19.8 million in 2013. Comcast was among the top backers of Barack Obama's presidential runs, with Comcast vice president David Cohen raising over $2.2 million from 2007 to 2012. Cohen {{has been described by}} many sources as influential in the US government, though he is no longer a registered lobbyist, as the time he spends lobbying falls short of the 20% which requires official registration. Comcast's PAC, the Comcast Corporation and NBCUniversal Political Action Committee, is the among the largest PACs in the US, raising about $3.7 million from 2011 to 2012 for the campaigns of various candidates for office in the United States Federal Government. Comcast is also a major backer of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association Political Action Committee, which raised $2.6 million from 2011 to 2012. Comcast spent the most money of any organization in support of the Stop Online Piracy and PROTECT IP bills, spending roughly $5 million to lobby for their passage.|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Berkshire {{surprised}} investors {{by making}} large equity {{investments in the}} major US airlines. Buffett had previously described airlines as a [...] "deathtrap for investors". Buffett had made an investment in US Airways in 1989 which, although he sold for a profit, almost lost Berkshire a substantial sum of money. As of 2017, Berkshire is currently the largest shareholder in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines and a top 3 shareholder in Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. Buffett himself has described this as a [...] "call on the industry" [...] rather than a choice in an <b>individual</b> <b>company.</b> American Airline's CEO Doug Parker {{is said to have}} won over Ted Weschler in arguing that the airline industry had consolidated sufficiently and rationalised supply such that longer term profitability could be achieved in an industry that has historically been loss making in aggregate.|$|E

The state-controlled oil giant Petrobrás registers more patents than any other <b>individual</b> <b>company</b> in Brazil. Moreover, electricity-producing companies are directed by law to invest a given percentage of their revenue in R Although energy is a key economic sector, the government cut back its spending on energy research from 2.1% to 1.1% of the total between 2000 and 2008 and again to 0.3% in 2012. Renewable energy sources have been the primary victim of these cuts, as public investment has increasingly turned towards deep-sea oil and gas exploration off Brazil’s southeast coast. One area that has been directly affected by this is trend is the ethanol industry, which has had to close plants and cut back its own investment in R Part of the ethanol industry’s woes have resulted from Petrobrás’ pricing policies. Under the influence of the government, its major stockholder, Petrobrás artificially depressed petrol prices between 2011 and 2014 to control inflation. This in turn depressed ethanol prices, making ethanol uneconomic to produce. This policy ended up eating into Petrobrás’ own revenue, forcing it to cut back its investment in oil and gas exploration. As Petrobrás alone is responsible for about 10% of all fixed capital investment in Brazil, this trend, along with the corruption scandal shaking the company since 2014, will certainly have ramifications for Brazil’s overall investment in R ...|$|E
