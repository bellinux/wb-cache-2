25|$|Despite {{being under}} Roman rule for almost 1000 years, the Seljuqs rapidly {{consolidated}} their holdings over Anatolia. This {{allowed them to}} hold on to their lands and made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> difficult for the Byzantines during the Komnenian restoration to re-conquer. The result was that even when the Byzantine empire was not riddled with civil disputes, it could not defeat the Seljuq Turks, who rarely allowed the Byzantines to engage them, hence the slow campaigning of John Komnenus.|$|E
25|$|Although critic Dennis Harvey {{found the}} script full of plot holes, {{they were no}} {{more so than in}} the average slasher film. He criticized the main {{character}} of Eddie as bland, but had good words for Andrew Levitas' performance as the hedonistic Chaz. Laura Kern found the dialogue corny, but had very positive words for the way each character was brought to life (which, she felt, made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> difficult to watch each person die). Critics Jeff Shannon and Peter Hartlaub also found the characters well-developed, and Hartlaub thought the performances by Dylan Fergus and Matt Phillips were the best in the film. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Wilmington similarly enjoyed the way the film presented the audience with various stereotypes (drag queen, leatherman, sex addict) and then killed them off, leaving the most fully realized character alive.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued whether Anselm's {{reluctance}} to take the see was sincere or not. Scholars such as Southern and Kent maintain Anselm's honest preference was to remain at Bec. Anselm had initially considered becoming a hermit and, naturally drawn to contemplation, he likely would have cared little for such a political office {{at the best of}} times and disliked <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> amid his own troubled age. Against this, Vaughn notes that feigned reluctance to accept important positions was a common practice within the medieval church, as open eagerness risked earning a reputation as an ambitious careerist. She further notes that his approach improved his negotiating position and that he finally acted at the moment that gained him the greatest leverage in advancing the interests of his see and the reform movement within the church.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the writing}} {{was on the}} wall, Dinky's offerings in the 1970s covered the entire {{spectrum}} of vehicles, both real and fictitious. Besides the normal gamut of passenger, sports and racing cars, buses, farm, emergency and military vehicles – cars, aeroplanes and spacecraft were also offered from popular (mostly British) TV shows of the time like Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, UFO, Thunderbirds, the Pink Panther, The Secret Service, and Joe 90 (Dinky Toys 1974). It could be argued, though, {{that it was too}} little too late, as Corgi Toys had already been offering for several years vehicles from far more well-known shows and movies in the United States like Batman, The Saint, Daktari, James Bond, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

500|$|In 1933, Grant gained {{attention}} for {{appearing in the}} pre-Code films She Done Him Wrong [...] and I'm No Angel opposite Mae West. West would later claim that she had discovered Cary Grant. Pauline Kael noted that Grant did not appear confident {{in his role as}} a Salvation Army director in She Done Him Wrong, which made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> charming. The film was a box office hit, earning more than $2 million in the United States, and has since won much acclaim. For I'm No Angel, Grant's salary was increased from $450 to $750 a week. The film was even more successful than She Done Him Wrong, and saved Paramount from bankruptcy; Vermilye cites it {{as one of the best}} comedy films of the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise".

500|$|Mr. Nobody is a {{tale about}} choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a {{position}} where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future) once solved makes <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> difficult – [...] "I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one." [...] The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in storyline, between young boy, adolescent, and mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.|$|E
500|$|Sims said Victoria's {{suffering}} {{was shown}} to make the viewer sympathise with her, but noted it is difficult because she committed an unforgivable crime, although her mental state is not entirely clear {{because of the fact}} [...] "her mind has been erased so many times that the crime is barely a memory." [...] Lambie stated it was done to explore [...] "how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen", and concluded, [...] "whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty". Atad asserted it ultimately lead viewers to choose between their [...] "so-called justice and the competing value of empathy". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals we seek to discipline?" [...] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a [...] "morally complex idea" [...] without taking a side on the discussion.

[...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting.

At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from.

500|$|The darker {{approach}} to the popular magical girl subgenre in Japanese anime and manga was also a point of high praise by reviewers. In its take on the series, the staff at Japanator remarked that this trope [...] "added a level of depth and complexity to the genre that we haven’t ever seen, and I don’t think we will see again. [...] Adding on that dressing gave the show a more perverse and cruel feeling to it, making <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> compelling to watch." [...] Liz Ohanesian of LA Weekly attributed the genre deconstruction of Puella Magi Madoka Magica to the series' popularity with older, male audiences, an otherwise unusual demographic to the genre. Furthermore, she commented on cultural impact that the series produced, observing that in both Japan and the US there has been incredible fan captivation surrounding the series. She credited the all-star crew including writer Urobuchi, director Shinbo, and the Shaft animation studio as [...] "hitmakers" [...] and described the anime as [...] "a series designed for acclaim." [...] TechnologyTell's Jenni Lada warned that the show's external appearance belied its true [...] "darker and more twisted" [...] essence. She recommended viewers watch at least three episodes in order to discover the series' true nature. The subversion of the magical girl genre was said to [...] "draw attention {{to the question of}} narrative power", particularly in the use of alternative timelines, as the characters fight for their survival. Production I.G's Katsuyuki Motohiro watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica after hearing opinions that it exceeded Neon Genesis Evangelion. Upon viewing the series, he was so amazed that he began analyzing Urobuchi's other works and was then motivated to request Urobuchi to write the crime thriller Psycho-Pass. In issue 103 of Neo, journalist Matt Kamen wrote, [...] "With its...daring {{approach to}} a dated genre, Puella Magi Madoka Magica essentially does for magical girls what Neon Genesis Evangelion did for giant robots."
