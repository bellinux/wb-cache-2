5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>port</b> must nevertheless be neutralised. The Germans had pre-emptively scuttled a blockship in the port's entrance channel, with the intention of preventing Goliath and the other heavy British warships from entering the harbour to shell the undefended city. With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>port,</b> thus denying its use to the Germans as well. Command of the assault was given to Commander Ritchie as the second most senior officer present, and he commandeered two small auxiliary gunboats, Dupleix and Helmuth, to carry his raiding parties.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} an {{optimization model}} for container liner services that simultaneously optimizes the shipping route and the container slot allocation on vessels {{by considering the}} interactions between the container shipping scheme and <b>the</b> transport demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ports.</b> <b>The</b> model consists of two input factors and two processes. The input factors include the shipping scheme and <b>the</b> transport demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ports.</b> <b>The</b> processes relate to the optimization of the shipping scheme for a fixed transport demand and the adjustment of the transport demand for a given shipping schedule. We demonstrate <b>the</b> model <b>in</b> an empirical case study on liner service optimization on the trade route between East Asia and West Europe...|$|R
