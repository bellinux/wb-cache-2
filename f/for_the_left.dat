5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E

5|$|The right lung of {{the river}} otter {{is larger than the}} left, having four lobes {{compared}} with two <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> Reduced lobulation of the lungs is presumed to be adaptive for underwater swimming. In addition, the length of the trachea {{of the river}} otter is intermediate between that of terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals. The mean tracheal length of the river otter is , or 23.2% of the body length. A shorter trachea may improve air exchange and increase lung ventilation in diving mammals.|$|E

5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the hilum and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and right lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{completed}} his move to Real Madrid on a five-year deal on 22 August 2007, with the transfer fee reported as £24million (€35million). He made his debut on 18 September {{as a substitute}} for Raúl during a Champions League match against Werder Bremen, which Real Madrid won 2–1. His La Liga debut came on 23 September, {{as a substitute for}} Royston Drenthe in a 1–1 away draw against Real Valladolid. On 10 February 2008, Robben scored his first goal, coming at home in a 7–0 victory against Valladolid. Robben proved crucial for many Real Madrid matches, making his famous runs down the left wing and quickly became a first choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> midfield position, making 28 appearances during his debut season and scoring five goals. Real Madrid won the Liga title with multiple games to spare, and were already the champions of Spain when they played their arch-rivals Barcelona on 7 May 2008. The Barcelona players formed a guard of honour as the Madrid team came onto the pitch at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Robben played an important part in Real Madrid's subsequent 4–1 victory, scoring the champions' second goal.|$|E
