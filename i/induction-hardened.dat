50|$|Many {{textbooks}} and vocational schools instruct mechanics to grind down {{the tip of}} the blade, which, due to the taper, increases its thickness and consequently allows more precise engagement with the slot in the screw. This approach creates a set of graduated slotted screwdrivers that fit a particular screw for a tighter engagement and reduce screw head deformation. However, many better-quality screwdriver blades are already <b>induction-hardened</b> (surface heat-treated), and tip grinding after manufacture compromises their durability. Thus, it is best to select a tip made to fit precisely to begin with, and avoid weakening the factory heat-treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese saw (nokogiri 鋸), which cuts on {{the pull}} stroke, {{rather than the}} European style push stroke. This allows the blades to be quite thin in {{comparison}} to the Western saw. There are two main kinds of cutting teeth on Japanese saws: rip (yoko noko-giri)and crosscut (tate-noko-giri). The rip and crosscut are combined in one blade, known as a ryoba (lit. [...] "dual edge":; 両刃). The rip and crosscut patterns are also made in single-edged saws, kataha nokogiri 片刃, both with stiffening back pieces and without. The stiff-backed saws, known as douzuki　(lit. [...] "with guide"; 導付き) are typically used in cutting fine joinery. There are many other types of Japanese saws as well: osae-biki 押さえ引き鋸 (lit. [...] "press-cut saw"), used for flush-cutting pegs to a surface without marring the surface. The saw teeth have no set to one or both sides to accomplish this feat. There is the azebiki (lit. ridge saw; 畔挽き), which has cutting both rip and crosscut teeth, and is short and rounded in profile. It is used for sawing in confined areas and starting cuts in the middle of surfaces. There are many other types and sub-types of saw. Most saws sold in the West are mass-produced items with <b>induction-hardened</b> teeth and relatively cheap replaceable blades. The handmade forged saws are very laborious to make and involve more manufacturing steps in the forging to complete than planes or chisels.|$|E

[...] The [...] "351 Cobra Jet" [...] high-performance engine that included a different intake manifold, high-lift, long-duration camshaft with hydraulic valve lifters, different valve springs and dampers, a 750-CFM spread-bore 4300-D Motorcraft carburetor, dual-point distributor (with four-speed manual transmissions only), and four-bolt main bearing caps. These engines also featured <b>induction-hardened</b> exhaust seats for use with low-lead and unleaded gasoline. This engine {{was different from the}} 1970-71 M-code 351C having a more aggressive camshaft, a spread-bore carburetor, a four-bolt block and the lower compression allowed regular fuel to be used. It was rated at [...] for all 1971 applications. For the 1972 model year, the only change to the engine was a retarding the camshaft events by 4°. [...] The engine was rated at [...] (SAE net) for 1972 when installed in the Mustang, and [...] in the Torino and Montego. An increase in the combustion chamber size and the use of smaller valves occurred in 1973, which reduced horsepower to [...] for the four-barrel for the intermediate Fords, though it still retained the higher [...] rating in the Mustang.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{tempering}} {{effect on}} the wear characteristics of <b>induction-hardened</b> SPS 5 steel was investigated. For this purpose, three tempering conditions were applied to control the hardness and microstructure of heat-treated SPS 5 steel. Ball-on-disk wear tests have been performed using zircornia balls on the tempered specimens to determine the variation of wear characteristics. The results showed that friction coefficient decreased with increasing hardness for <b>induction-hardened</b> SPS 5 steel. This seems to occur because real contact area between specimen and mating ball was affected by the specimen hardness. Also, we observe the wear type changes from the plowing wear to the adhesive wear as the hardness increases and the adhesive wear particles act {{as an obstacle to}} the transmission of the force of friction, reducing the coefficient of friction and the wear rate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{determine}} the {{bending fatigue strength}} of precision forged spur gears and to compare the results with those obtained from conventional cut gears, single tooth bending fatigue tests were carried out on both through-hardened and <b>induction-hardened</b> gear teeth. The gears were produced from rolled bar cut blanks, disc forged blanks or precision forged teeth blanks. For this purpose, a special test fixture was designed and built for an Amsler high-frequency vibrophore fatigue testing machine. The {{results show that the}} endurance limit of precision forged gears is significantly higher than those obtained from cut gears. The bending fatigue strength of forged gears was some 12. 5 per cent higher than the cut teeth in a through-hardened condition and 8. 4 per cent higher for the <b>induction-hardened</b> teeth. The eVect of surface roughness at the tooth root area on the bending fatigue strength of the forged gears is also shown...|$|E
40|$|Surface-hardening {{treatments}} {{are used in}} order to enhance the resistance of mating gear teeth surfaces to wear and fatigue crack initiation. The treatments create a compressive residual stress state near the tooth surface, which acts to impede crack initiation and propagation. Accurate determination of this residual stress field is important for quantifying the effect of treatment and optimizing the processing conditions. Neutron diffraction provides a powerful non-destructive experimental tool for residual stress evaluation. By collecting residual strain data for three different orientations, the principal stress directions and values can be mapped. This paper describes the procedure used for building such maps using the G 5. 2 spectrometer at Laboratoire Léon Brillouin, Saclay, and presents the results obtained for an <b>induction-hardened</b> gear.

40|$|Case depth {{measurements}} of surface hardened steel parts {{are important for}} quality control. The magnetic properties, including initial permeability, differential permeability and saturation magnetization {{of a series of}} <b>induction-hardened</b> and carburized steel rods were studied through measurements, with the aim of developing new methods to evaluate the case depth nondestructively. Four-point alternating current potential drop (ACPD) method also has the potential to evaluate different case depths. The potential drop was measured on a series of 12 ̆ 2 diameter <b>induction-hardened</b> and carburized steel rod samples using a co-linear probe with pins aligned parallel to the axis of the rod. For comparison with the above-mentioned electromagnetic measurements, hardness profiles were obtained by microhardness measurements. It seems that {{measurements of}} initial permeability on surface hardened rods do not give a clear indication of case depth. Differential permeability was plotted versus applied magnetic field H. It is interesting to see that, when H is around 18 Oe, the differential permeability increases more-or-less in the sequence of case depth d in induction hardened samples. Differential permeability measurements give a good indication of case depth in induction hardened rods, but not carburized rods. The saturation magnetization decreases as the case depth increases. It was shown that four-point ACPD is a promising technique for distinguishing between different depths of case hardening. Especially in the low-frequency range of the real part of the normalized impedance, there is very good distinction between the case depths of the samples...|$|E
40|$|Induction {{hardening}} depth evaluation {{by means of}} Barkhausen noise (BN) technique is one known non-destructive evaluation (NDE). The acquired signal, nevertheless, {{is not easy to}} be interpreted owing to information and materials complexity. Current study is initiated from a case in local industry about the quality control of induction hardened camshaft. Certain historical BN data is reviewed, and hypothetical hardening conditions are simulated in order to find out a possible relationship between the acquired signal and the microstructure of the hardened layer. Selected physical properties of these simulated hardened layers were evaluated. Using these data, physical modelling was developed by means of finite element method (FEM). A magnetising unit is modelled and the induced magnetic flux density in the material is simulated. Modelling results were then compared with experimental study. The project work is at the preliminary stage and it is expected that the ultimate model will help to improve the understanding of the BN signal in relations to the <b>induction-hardened</b> depth evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{stresses}} which are, {{since the}} completion of manufacturing, termed residual stresses very much reflect the manufacturing procedures and machining conditions. Residual stresses are analysed in terms of different induction surface hardening conditions and then also after finish grinding in terms of different machining conditions. Induction surface hardening creates very desirable residual stresses in the hardened surface layer. Residual stresses are always of a compressive nature and are usually present to {{the depth of the}} <b>induction-hardened</b> layer. By the appropriate selection of grinding wheel and grinding conditions and taking into account the physical and mechanical properties of the workpiece material very favourable compressive residual stresses in the hardened surface layer can be retained. How is it possible to assure a desirable surface and surface layer quality after induction-hardening and fine grinding? Finding an answer to this question requires a very good knowledge of the process of grinding on the micro-level as well as knowledge of mechanical and heat effects acting on the layer of the workpiece including the type and condition of the grinding wheel. An all-inclusive consideration of the numerous influences of the kind and condition of the tool on the changes on the surface and in the surface layer of the workpiece in the given machining conditions is described by the term "surface integrity"...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{axle shaft}} of fork lift failed at {{operation}} within 296 h of service. The shaft transmits torque from discrepancy to wheel through planetary gear arrangement. A section of fractured axle shaft made of <b>induction-hardened</b> steel was analyzed {{to determine the}} root cause of the failure. Optical microscopies as well as field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out to characterize the microstructure. Hardness profile throughout the cross-section was evaluated by micro-hardness measurements. Chemical analysis indicated that the shaft was made of 42 CrMo 4 steel grade as per specification. Microstructural analysis and micro-hardness profile revealed that the shaft was improperly heat treated resulting in a brittle case, where crack was found to initiate from the case in a brittle mode in contrast to ductile mode within the core. This behaviour was related to differences in microstructure, which was observed to be martensitic within the case with a micro-hardness equivalent to 735 HV, and a mixture of non-homogeneous structure of pearlite and ferrite within the core with a hardness of 210 HV. The analysis suggests that the fracture initiated from the martensitic case as brittle mode due to improper heat treatment process (high hardness). Moreover the inclusions along the hot working direction i. e. in the longitudinal axis made the component more susceptible to failure...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{hardness}} of industrial parts which {{are subject to}} high wear is usually treated by surface hardening processes. For hardened surfaces, it is desirable to know both the {{surface hardness}} value {{and the depth of}} the hardened layer. Ultrasonic testing has been used to nondestructively measure the depth of the hardened surface layer. The technique is based on the detection of the transition between different polycrystalline structures due to their variation in backscattering characteristics. Increase of the grain size increases the backscattering of ultrasonic waves. The hardened top layer of the part has small grains while the base material has larger grains. Accordingly, the hardened top layer structure is transparent to ultrasonic waves while the coarse-grained base material structure exhibits considerable ultrasonic backscattering, which results in signal amplitudes suitable for display. However, if the depth of the hardened layer is very small, the discrimination of the backscattered echoes becomes very difficult. Special signal processing techniques including Wiener filtering and autoregressive spectral extrapolation have been used to overcome this problem. Using an immersion ultrasonic system, the depth of the hardened layer has been measured on a number of <b>induction-hardened</b> specimens. These specimens are then subjected to destructive tests. Comparison of the results indicates that the application of signal processing techniques have significantly improved the capability of ultrasonic measurements...|$|E
40|$|To The {{ratcheting}} {{behavior of}} high-strength rail steel (Australian Standard AS 1085. 1) is studied {{in this work}} {{for the purpose of}} predicting wear and damage to the rail surface. Historically, researchers have used circular test coupons obtained from the rail head to conduct cyclic load tests, but according to hardness profile data, considerable variation exists across the rail head section. For example, the <b>induction-hardened</b> rail (AS 1085. 1) shows high hardness (400 - 430 HV 100) up to four-millimeters into the rail head’s surface, but then drops considerably beyond that. Given that cyclic test coupons five millimeters in diameter at the gauge area are usually taken from the rail sample, there is a high probability that the original surface properties of the rail do not apply across the entire test coupon and, therefore, data representing only average material properties are obtained. In the literature, disks (47 mm in diameter) for a twin-disk rolling contact test machine have been obtained directly from the rail sample and used to validate rolling contact fatigue wear models. The question arises: How accurate are such predictions? In this research paper, the effect of rail sampling position on the ratcheting behavior of AS 1085. 1 rail steel was investigated using rectangular shaped specimens. Uniaxial stress-controlled tests were conducted with samples obtained at four different depths to observe the ratcheting behaviour of each. Micro-hardness measurements of the test coupons were carried out to obtain a constitutive relationship to predict the effect of depth on the ratcheting behaviour of the rail material. This work ultimately assists the selection of valid material parameters for constitutive models in the study of rail surface ratcheting...|$|E
