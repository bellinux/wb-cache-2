5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate</b> (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E

40|$|The {{adherence}} of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) to nylon fibre {{was investigated}} in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative proctocolitis, and anorexia nervosa, and compared with changes of circulating PMNs, C reactive protein concentrations, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates,</b> and clinical assessment of disease activity. PMN adherence was {{in excess of the}} maximum value detected for healthy subjects in 14 of 25 patients with Crohn's disease and two of 10 with proctocolitis, but it was within the normal range for all eight with anorexia nervosa. High adherence in Crohn's disease, however, was not associated with quantitative or qualitative changes of PMN populations, absolute concentrations of C reactive protein, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates,</b> disease severity, drug regimens, malnutrition, or zinc deficiency. High PMN adherence in Crohn's disease may therefore reflect the activation in vivo of normal PMN by humoral factors...|$|R
40|$|Jaw claudication, diplopia, or a {{temporal}} artery abnormality on physical exam {{increase the likelihood}} of temporal arteritis. A finding of thrombocytosis in a patient with suspected temporal arteritis moderately increases the likelihood of this diagnosis (strength of recommendation: B, based on systematic reviews of retrospective cohort studies). Patients with temporal arteritis frequently complain of headaches, and often have mildly abnormal <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> (ESR), but neither of these findings helps in the diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate,</b> anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained.

50|$|The {{most common}} and helpful way to {{diagnose}} thyroiditis is first for a physician to palpate the thyroid gland during a physical examination.

Blood tests also help to determine the kind of thyroiditis and {{to see how much}} thyroid stimulating hormone the pituitary gland is producing and what antibodies are present in the body.

25|$|When a PE {{is being}} suspected, several blood tests {{are done in}} order to exclude {{important}} secondary causes of PE.

40|$|No {{cardiological}} {{signs or}} symptoms {{were seen in}} three patients with left atrial myxomas. The diagnosis was established by cross sectional echocardiography.

Patients were seen at regular intervals (days 0, 30, 60, 90, 150, 180) and the following variables determined: <b>erythrocytes</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rate,</b> C-reactive protein, fasting serum glucose, pain measured by visual analog scale, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effects of Expressive Release Therapy upon the physical and psychosocial aspects of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It was anticipated that the release of constricted emotion, particularly anger, might produce (1) reductions in the severity of and amount of time in pain, (2) improved musculoskeletal functioning, and (3) improved psychological functioning. Six women, aged 26 - 68, with RA in active II or III participated in this A-B with follow-up replicated design. Pain levels were reported on visual analogues; musculoskeletal examinations were conduced by a rheumatology technician; morning stiffness and daily functioning were assessed by self-report instruments. <b>Erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates</b> used the Westergren method of analysis. Psychosocial functioning was assessed by the degression and hostility scales of the SCL- 90, and Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Katz Adjustment Scale. The design consisted of a four week baseline control, a ten week treatment, and a four week follow-up period. Results were analyzed by visual analysis, Friedman analysis of variance, Pearson product moment correlations and Wilcoxon signed rank W tests. A significance level of. 05 was selected and a criteria for "meaningful change" was established at ±. 5 SE(m). Visual analysis revealed that pain levels tended to be lower at post-session across all but the baseline phase. Treatment failed to produce a significant effect on pain and on musculoskeletal functioning, morning stiffness, daily functioning, and <b>erythrocyte</b> <b>sedimentation</b> <b>rates.</b> Treatment failed to produce significant effects on psychosocial functioning. However, "possibly meaningful changes" were found in all three psychosocial measures. The study did find support for the contention that the constriction of hostile affect is positively related to the severity of pain. The findings of the study lend support to the effectiveness of Expressive Release Therapy as a means to enhance the coping strategies of RA patients...|$|R
