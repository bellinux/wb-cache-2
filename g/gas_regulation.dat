5000|$|The {{swelling}} of the stems was assumed to {{have been influenced by}} the presence of gall insects, most notably of the genus Odynerus.

Irritation caused by this process was said to have enlarged the cavity over time. Recently, research performed by a world authority on the genus Eriogonum, Dr. J. L.

50|$|Kerr {{used his}} success as {{governor}} to catapult {{himself into the}} U.S. Senate in 1948. Although he had national ambitions, he always put what he {{perceived to be the}} interests of his state first. Unlike many of his peers he generally neglected headline-grabbing issues, including anticommunism, foreign affairs, and civil rights, in favor of more mundane topics such as oil policies and public works. He believed Oklahomans would benefit most, and support him strongly, if he concentrated on concrete economic matters. In a closely contested race, Kerr became the first Oklahoma governor elected to the Senate. He had Presidential aspirations briefly in 1952, but he failed to win the Democratic nomination. Kerr devoted his energies to building his Senate career. In the Senate, Kerr's activism on natural <b>gas</b> <b>regulation</b> quickly won him a reputation for being a staunch defender of his region and its special interests, including his own petroleum company. His personality reinforced these first impressions. Kerr's colleagues widely considered him a brilliant debater who overwhelmed his opponents with his passion and his mastery of policy detail.|$|E
