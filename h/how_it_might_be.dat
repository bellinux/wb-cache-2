25|$|Debriefing {{is another}} useful strategy. Healthcare {{providers}} meet {{to discuss a}} situation, record what they learned and discuss <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> better handled. Closed loop communication is another important technique used {{to ensure that the}} message that was sent is received and interpreted by the receiver. SBAR is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in the most convenient form possible. Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, at the {{precocious}} age of 15, Perkin {{entered the}} Royal College of Chemistry in London (now part of Imperial College London), where {{he began his}} studies under August Wilhelm von Hofmann. At this time, chemistry was still primitive: although the atomic theory was accepted, the major elements had been discovered, and techniques to analyse the proportions of the elements in many compounds were in place, {{it was still a}} difficult proposition to determine the arrangement of the elements in compounds. Hofmann had published a hypothesis on <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible to synthesise quinine, an expensive natural substance much in demand for the treatment of malaria. Having become one of Hofmann's assistants, he embarked on a series of experiments to try to achieve this end.|$|E

25|$|In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an {{important}} {{paper to the}} Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still {{goes by the name}} of Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice. His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, in {{the wider}} context of the Greco-Persian wars, {{it was a very}} {{significant}} battle for the Allies. The Allies had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the Persian navy, even having the better of some encounters. For many of the Allied crews, it was their first taste of battle, and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of Salamis. Moreover, fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed, and gave them insights into <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> beaten. In addition, the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet (even if this was not all due to military action), meaning that the odds faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming. As the poet Pindar put it, Artemisium was [...] "where the sons of the Athenians laid the shining foundation-stone of freedom".|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} factors {{influenced}} the focus on such subject matter. Many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment {{with the state of}} society, as well as a discomfort with social prejudices. Grunge lyrics contained [...] "...explicit political messages and...questioning about...society and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> changed...". While grunge lyrics were less overtly political than punk songs, grunge songs still indicated a concern for social issues, particularly those affecting young people. [...] The main themes in grunge were [...] "tolerance of difference", [...] "support of women", [...] "mistrust of authority" [...] and [...] "cynicism towards big corporations." [...] Grunge song themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians. In 1992, music critic Simon Reynolds said that [...] "there's a feeling of burnout in the culture at large. Kids are depressed about the future". The topics of grunge lyrics–homelessness, suicide, rape, [...] "broken homes, drug addiction and self-loathing" [...] contrasted sharply to the glam metal lyrics of Poison, which described [...] "life in the fast lane", partying and hedonism.|$|E

The Cuban physician was a strong advocate of the transmission theory as the cause of yellow fever and discovered the type of mosquito that transmits yellow fever. His unsophisticated experiments that proved this were discounted by many, but were the basis of Reed's research.|$|E

2500|$|Frank McNally, {{writing in}} honour of the author's 100th birthday, {{reflects}} on {{the breadth of the}} appeal of the series of novels, for the quality of the writing and the relationships between the characters, which put them beyond the typical naval adventure, and gain interest from readers who [...] "wouldn’t touch Horatio Hornblower with a bargepole." [...] Lucy Eyre wrote to point out the appeal of the series to women readers, mentioning the nautical detail, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> viewed the same as precise medical language on the television program ER.

2500|$|The other {{series that}} Moore began for Taboo was Lost Girls, which he {{described}} {{as a work of}} intelligent [...] "pornography". Illustrated by Melinda Gebbie, with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and Wendy from Peter Pan – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters. With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that [...] "I had a lot of different ideas as to <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible to do an up-front sexual comic strip and {{to do it in a}} way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards." [...] Like From Hell, Lost Girls outlasted Taboo, and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Although Dr. Reed has {{received}} {{much of the}} credit in United States history books for [...] "beating" [...] yellow fever, he had fully credited Dr. Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector, and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> controlled. Reed often cited Finlay's papers in his own articles, and also gave him credit for the discovery in his personal correspondence. The acceptance of Finlay's work {{was one of the most}} important and far-reaching effects of the Walter Reed Commission of 1900. Applying methods first suggested by Finlay, the United States government and Army eradicated yellow fever in Cuba and later in Panama, allowing completion of the Panama Canal. While Reed built on the research of Carlos Finlay, historian François Delaporte notes that yellow fever research was a contentious issue. Scientists, including Finlay and Reed, became successful by building on the work of less prominent scientists, without always giving them the credit they were due. Reed's research was essential in the fight against yellow fever. He should also receive full credit for his use of the first type of medical consent form during his experiments in Cuba, an attempt to ensure that participants knew they were taking a risk by being part of testing.|$|E
2500|$|Albert Einstein, himself one of {{the founders}} of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more {{philosophical}} or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of determinism and of causality. He is famously quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, [...] "God does not play with dice". He rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that a state of nature occurs in its own right, regardless of whether or <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> observed. In that view, he is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state, which remains invariant under arbitrary choice of configuration space for its representation, that is to say, manner of observation. He also held that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words, he insisted on the principle of locality. He considered, but rejected on theoretical grounds, a particular proposal for hidden variables to obviate the indeterminism or acausality of quantum mechanical measurement. He considered that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena. He thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances, and would not come quickly or easily. The Bohr-Einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an epistemological point of view. In arguing for his views, he produced a series of objections, the most famous of which has become known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the {{prohibition}} of coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS), Maimonides taught that any person who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house, or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that the person can purchase from the colleague and pressures the colleague with friends and requests until the colleague agrees to sell, violates a negative commandment, even though the person pays much money for it, as [...] (20:14 in NJSP) says, [...] "Do not covet." [...] Maimonides taught that the violation of this commandment was not punished by lashes, {{because it does not}} involve a deed. Maimonides taught that a person does not violate [...] (20:14 in NJSP) until the person actually takes the article that the person covets, as reflected by [...] "Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself." [...] Maimonides read the word for [...] "covet" [...] in both [...] (20:14 in NJSP) and [...] to refer to coveting accompanied by a deed. Maimonides taught that a person who desires a home, a spouse, utensil, or anything else belonging to a colleague that the person can acquire violates a negative commandment when the person thinks in the person's heart <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible to acquire this thing from the colleague. Maimonides read [...] (5:18 in NJPS), [...] "Do not desire," [...] to refer even to feelings in the heart alone. Thus, a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. A person who purchases an object the person desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, Maimonides concluded, the Torah prohibits both desiring in [...] (5:18 in NJPS) and coveting in [...] (20:14 in NJSP). And if the person takes the article by robbery, the person violates three negative commandments.|$|E
