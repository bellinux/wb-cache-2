5|$|With {{seven seconds}} left in {{regulation}} and the score tied at 28, Yeldon made a long run as time expired. The play was reviewed from the replay booth, and one second was put back on the clock after the referees determined Yeldon had stepped out of bounds just before time expired. Alabama then opted to attempt a game-winning 57-yard field goal, but chose freshman kicker Adam Griffith over Foster due to Foster's woes that day. Alabama failed its fourth field goal of the day with Griffith's attempt falling short, but Auburn's Chris Davis fielded it nine yards <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own end zone, and with no Crimson Tide skill players in his path (the field goal unit was made up almost entirely of offensive linemen), sprinted for a 109-yard touchdown return and a 34–28 Auburn win. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–35–1.|$|E
25|$|G. A. Broomfield {{had been}} an {{assistant}} and friend to Cody {{after he left the}} Army and moved to Laffan's Plain. In 1948, he presented to the Science Museum, Kensington, a model of the No.1 machine which was wrong in many details. He claimed that the first flight had been in May 1908. This was one month before a similar claimed first flight by A. V. Roe, and Bloomfield wanted to establish primacy for Cody. Roe's claim was later disallowed, but by then Broomfield was too <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> story to back out.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the game {{could not have been}} much better for East Carolina or worse for Marshall. On the second play from scrimmage, Leftwich threw a screen pass <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own {{territory}} that bounced off the arms of intended receiver Denero Marriott into the hands of Ty Hunt, who returned the interception 12 yards for the game's first touchdown. On Marshall's second possession, a snap out of the shotgun went over Leftwich's right shoulder, and Jerome Stewart picked up the ball and ran it back 43 yards for another Pirates touchdown. Marshall appeared to be finding its rhythm on its third drive, with Leftwich completing five consecutive passes. However, that drive also ended in a turnover, with Leftwich throwing an interception to Stewart in the end zone. The quarter would end with the Pirates up 21-0, with Garrard scoring on a 9-yard run.|$|E

25|$|In April 2009, Abhisit faced massive anti-government protests {{led by the}} pro-Thaksin red shirts {{which caused}} the Fourth East Asia Summit to be {{canceled}} and was followed by riots in Bangkok. Days after the Bangkok unrest was quelled by military force, gunmen ambushed Sondhi's car, a black Toyota Vellfire, at a petrol station. They shot out the tires, and fired over 100 M-16 and AK-47 assault rifle rounds at the car. The attackers escaped from the scene when Sondhi's followers in another car opened fire on them. Sondhi suffered a serious head wound but remained conscious, standing and lucid before being sent to a hospital for emergency surgery. Sondhi survived the surgery, which involved removing several bullet fragments embedded about half a centimetre <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> skull. It is not certain who was behind the shooting, though Sondhi's son and PAD's spokesmen speculated that a faction of the military or police might have been behind it.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song include {{references}} to films Bale appeared in including Newsies, Swing Kids, American Psycho, and The Dark Knight. The song begins with the phrase, [...] "He is the Dark Knight, he is professional." [...] The piece incorporates audio clips from the incident {{through the use of}} sampling. The chorus {{of the song}} references Bale's use of the word professional in his altercation: [...] "Oh, whoo wow / He is professional / But I think he's lost control". Lyrics include: [...] "Swing Kid with a violent streak", [...] "Step back, stay out of his light / Better not try to put up a fight / Newsies will get you tonight / 'Cause they're professional!", and [...] "Don't look too <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might get a little bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho".|$|E
500|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, Burges having {{avoided the}} error {{that he had}} made at the McConnochie House when he placed a vast central staircase {{in the middle of the}} building. At The Tower House, the stair is consigned to the conical tower. The ground floor contains a drawing room, dining room and library, while the first floor holds bedroom suites and a study. If Burges shunned exterior decoration at The Tower House, he more than compensated internally. Each room has a complex iconographic scheme of decoration: that of the hall is Time, in the drawing room, Love, in Burges's bedroom, the Sea. Massive fireplaces with elaborate overmantels were carved and installed, a castle in the Library and mermaids and sea-monsters of the <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own bedroom.

500|$|The {{season began}} with eight {{straight}} victories, propelling Notre Dame {{to the top}} of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State, which ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the [...] "game of the century", ended in a 10–10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10–0 deficit by risking a turnover <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own territory late in the game. When Parseghian's team beat USC 51–0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian's team the national championship. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by Sporting News.|$|E
500|$|Henkes and Bindervoet {{generally}} summarise {{the critical}} consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative {{opening and closing}} chapters, the book concerns [...] "two big questions" [...] which are never resolved: {{what is the nature}} of protagonist HCE’s secret sin, and what was the letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man's original sin as a result of the Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying [...] "to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him" [...] and to this end [...] "HCE has, so <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man." [...] Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, [...] "Earwicker's alleged crime in the Park" [...] appears to have been of a [...] "voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature". [...] ALP's letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that [...] "he effect of ALP's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [...] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy argues that [...] "it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker's sins as [...] for (they tell us) she takes on her husband's guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice".|$|E
500|$|For Advent Children, Nomura {{agreed to}} direct the project largely because of his {{attachment}} {{to the character of}} Cloud. Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children, he did not believe that such an [...] "'upbeat' image of him is what stuck {{in the minds of the}} fans", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind [...] "consistent with the fans' view of him." [...] Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing. Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself. In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing. Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it. Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls. He originally intended for Aerith's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud's cell phone sinks into the water, but Nojima altered the scene because it [...] "sounded too creepy". The wolf which Cloud imagines [...] "represents the deepest part of Cloud's psyche" [...] and [...] "appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart", vanishing at the film's end. Nomura cites one of the film's final scenes, in which Cloud smiles, as his favorite, highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud's embarrassment. The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu's score, who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script, commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud's smile.|$|E

2500|$|If an {{opponent}} is <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> court, a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot, by softly tapping the ball {{just over the}} net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it.

In Pisemsky's second play, The Divide (Раздел, 1853), a typical natural school piece, parallels have been found with Turgenev's comedy Breakfast at the Chief's. Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: [...] "Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in The Muff and Marriage by Passion, put it next to the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two. At the bottom of this outlook lies the conviction that man <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> soul is a scoundrel, moved only by practical interests and egotistical, mostly dirty impulses, and for this reason one has to be on one's guard with one's neighbour and always keep 'a stone by one's bosom'." ...|$|E

Hitler refused {{to make such a}} public announcement, saying that it would strengthen the Gaullists against the Vichy France, but asked al-Husseini 'to lock ...<b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart' the following points, which Christopher Browning summarizes as follows, that ‘Germany has resolved, step by step, to ask one European nation after the other to solve its Jewish problem, and at the proper time, direct a similar appeal to non-European nations as well'. When Germany had defeated Russia and broken through the Caucasus into the Middle East, it would have no further imperial goals of its own and would support Arab liberation... But Hitler did have one goal. [...] "Germany’s objective would then be solely the destruction of the Jewish element residing in the Arab sphere under the protection of British power". (Das deutsche Ziel würde dann lediglich die Vernichtung des im arabischen Raum unter der Protektion der britischen Macht lebenden Judentums sein).
