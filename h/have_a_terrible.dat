Socrates admits that few {{climb out of the}} den, or cave of ignorance, and those who do, not only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{struggle}} to attain the heights, but when they go back down for a visit or to help other people up, they find themselves objects of scorn and ridicule.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think maybe because I feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E

2500|$|In summer 318, an {{imperial}} meeting hall in Pingyang {{was destroyed by}} a great fire, and it killed 21 people, including Liu Cong's son Liu Kang (劉康) the Prince of Kuaiji. [...] Liu Cong {{was said to have}} greatly mourned his son, and this appeared to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> effect on his health. [...] He summoned Liu Yao and Shi Le to the capital to serve as regents, but both Liu Yao and Shi declined. [...] He died soon after, and Liu Can became emperor. [...] Later that year, however, Liu Can would be murdered by Jin, who would then massacre the imperial clan. [...] Liu Yao and Shi defeated Jin and Liu Yao became emperor, but Liu Yao and Shi subsequently had a falling out, leading to Shi declaring independent and creating Later Zhao. [...] The empire that Liu Cong built was torn into halves.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the Flat Earth Society accused NASA of faking the landings, {{arguing that}} they were staged by Hollywood with Walt Disney sponsorship, based on a script by Arthur C. Clarke and {{directed}} by Stanley Kubrick. Folklorist Linda Dégh suggests that writer-director Peter Hyams' 1978 film Capricorn One, which shows a hoaxed journey to Mars in a spacecraft that looks identical to the Apollo craft, might have given a boost to the hoax theory's popularity in the post-Vietnam War era. She notes that this happened during the post-Watergate era, when American citizens were inclined to distrust official accounts. Dégh writes: [...] "The mass media catapult these half-truths {{into a kind of}} twilight zone where people can make their guesses sound as truths. Mass media <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> impact on people who lack guidance." [...] In A Man on the Moon, first published in 1994, Andrew Chaikin mentions {{that at the time of}} Apollo 8's lunar-orbit mission in December 1968, similar conspiracy ideas were already in circulation.|$|E
