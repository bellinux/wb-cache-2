40|$|Well logging is {{the process}} of {{recording}} various petro-physical, properties of rock/formations penetrated by <b>drilling.</b> <b>Log</b> responses are functions of lithology, porosity, fluid–content and textural variation of formation. This information coupled with characteristics of sedimentary structures derived from high resolution dipmeter surveys provide detailed insight into the sedimentary environment and allows estimation of the reservoir geometry & orientations. As such logs are ideal tools not only for quantitative evaluation of fluid content of each potential reservoir but also for the estimation of the size, shape & orientation of the reservoir. Thus the overall objective of recording well logs is to hel find & recover more hydrocarbons, in an economic way. An efficient log data base is essential requirement for any E & P company. To fulfil the objective, a LogDB software under EPINET Project, has been procured by ONGC Western Onshore, Basin, which is capable of handling and preserving all types of well log curves recorded in LIS, LAS & DLIS formats.

40|$|Rock {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominating operations in open pit mining efficiency. As many downstream processes depend on the blast-induced fragmentation, an optimized blasting strategy can influence the total revenue of a mine to a large extent. Boliden Aitik mine in northern Sweden {{is one of the}} largest copper mines in Europe. The annual production of the mine is expected to reach 36 million tonnes of ore in 2014; so continuous efforts are being made to boost the production. Highly automated equipment and new processing plant, in addition to new crushers, have sufficient capacity to reach the production goals; the current obstacle in the process of production increase is a bottleneck in crushers caused by oversize boulders. Boulders require extra efforts for secondary blasting or hammer breakage and if entered the crushers, they cause downtimes. Therefore a more evenly distributed fragmentation with less oversize material can be advantageous. Furthermore, a better fragmentation can cause a reduction in energy costs by demanding less amounts of crushing energy. In order to achieve a more favorable fragmentation, two alternative blast designs in addition to a reference design were tested and the results were evaluated and compared to the current design in Aitik. A comparatively large bench was divided to three sections with three different drill plans, which led to different specific charges in each section. The sections were drilled in patterns of 6 x 9 m, 7 x 9 m and 7 x 10 m of burden and spacing; planned specific charges of the sections were 1. 17 kg/m 3, 1. 02 kg/m 3, and 0. 91 kg/m 3 respectively. Similar to the current drill plan in Aitik, the section with 7 x 9 m (1. 02 kg/m 3 specific charge) was used as the reference for results comparison. The drilling and charging processes were monitored carefully and the post-blast parameters were measured accordingly. Laser scanning was used to measure the swelling of the sections and two different methods of image analysis were utilized to evaluate the fragmentation of the rock for each section. <b>Drilling</b> <b>log</b> data (MWD) were analyzed to evaluate the hardness of the rock; energy consumption log of the crusher was also analyzed and all the data was collected in a single database. VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming language was embedded within data spreadsheets to correlate the mentioned data to the coordinates of the rock by means of Minestar logs, which include both timestamps and coordinates of all machinery e. g. shovels and trucks. The results of the test show significant improvements in fragmentation and oversize material percentage in the section with 6 x 9 m drill plan (1. 17 kg/m 3). The advantage of 6 x 9 m plan was confirmed by 52 % higher swelling, 66 % lower oversize material and 26 % lower crushing energy compared to the reference section. The section with 7 x 10 m drill plan (0. 91 kg/m 3) also showed theoretically acceptable results; however, the deviations from reference were not as large as formerly mentioned section. The swelling had a decrease of 8 % compared to the reference section and the percentage of oversize material and crushing energy were increased by 16 % and 2 % respectively. Presented results are based only on technical aspects and do not include the costs of drilling and charging. Thus, in order to evaluate the drill plans in practice an economical evaluation of the sections should be conducted. Also a confirmation test with more accurate geology explorations is recommended. Finally, upon the request of Boliden Mines, a short report on the usage of Air-decking technique in Aitik is enclosed as an appendix. The report includes a brief introduction to air-decking and discusses practical solutions to apply this technique in Aitik. Validerat; 20121001 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Many SEDEX deposits, {{specifically}} {{those in}} Canada and Australia, are hosted by Proterozoic sedimentary rocks that were deposited in intracratonic or intra-rift tectonic settings. Rocks of similar age and tectonic settings {{are also found}} within east-central Minnesota. However, exploration for SEDEX deposits has been very limited in Minnesota due to an almost complete lack of outcrop. Also, while extensive drilling for iron-formation took place in these same areas, little drill core exists for examination. In lieu of this absence of information, all of the old <b>drill</b> <b>log</b> descriptions, from areas in Crow Wing and Aitkin Counties, were searched for any mention of “unique” features that may be indicative of SEDEX mineralization. This report summarizes the results of those <b>drill</b> <b>log</b> re-checks. In addition, core samples were also collected from select drill holes in the Cuyuna North Range for thin-section inspection. The samples were collected from the Mahnomen Formation in order to more fully document the spatial distribution of areas with, and without, tourmaline-bearing rocks. Previous studies (Cleland et al., 1996) found that tourmaline-bearing rocks were present in four widely-spaced holes and a large SEDEX hydrothermal system was envisioned to be present somewhere in the Cuyuna North Range. The lithologic <b>drill</b> <b>log</b> searches found some holes that contain descriptions of sulfide-bearing rocks, and in a very few instances, descriptions were found that are suggestive of tourmaline, but these are vague and uncertain (in {{all but a few}} instances, no drill core remains to conduct a further check of these vague descriptions). Attempts to outline further areas with tourmaline-bearing rocks in the Cuyuna North Range, by sampling and thin section inspection, were not successful as only trace amounts of tourmaline were found in only one, out of the eleven, drill holes that were studied. In essence, the thin section study, though limited in extent, indicates that tourmaline is not abundantly present everywhere in the footwall rocks of the North Range; rather, tourmaline-bearing rocks are present in at least three much smaller areas.
