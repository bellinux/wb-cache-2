They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Smaller group size: Limiting {{the group}} size {{can make it}} harder for social loafers to hide behind the shield of {{anonymity}} provided by a large group. In smaller groups, each member will <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> contribution will add greater value.|$|E

25|$|Many Quakers {{prior to}} the 20th century, {{considered}} the Religious Society of Friends to be a Christian movement, but did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> religious faith fit within the categories of Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant.

However, the English version of the record sold poorly everywhere except in Japan.|$|R
25|$|Male sexual entitlement, which {{consequently}} {{can predict}} sexual entitlement due to societal norms, {{has been found}} to predict rape-related attitudes and behaviors. If men <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> own sexual needs are more important, it is likely that they will have rape-related attitudes, as such, attitudes reinforce their own sexual entitlement as being the more dominant sex.|$|E
25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be less willing to assert the effort. If the group size is large, members can <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions can or should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups as they might have in smaller groups.|$|E
25|$|Increase identifiability: Studies {{of social}} loafing suggest {{that people are}} less {{productive}} when they are working with others, but social facilitation {{studies have shown that}} people are more productive when others are present (at least with an easy task). If individuals within a group know one another, <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> productivity or inputs are not identifiable, then social loafing is likely to occur. Alternatively, if individuals are anonymous and therefore unidentifiable, then social loafing may also be likely to occur.|$|E

25|$|General somatic {{sensations of}} a hallucinatory nature are {{experienced}} {{when an individual}} <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> body is being mutilated, i.e. twisted, torn, or disembowelled. Other reported cases are invasion by animals in the person's internal organs such as snakes in the stomach or frogs in the rectum. The general feeling that one's flesh is decomposing is also classified under this type of hallucination.|$|R
25|$|Minimize free riding: Free riding {{occurs when}} members do less work {{because some of}} the {{benefits}} accrue to others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may feel less motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is important to make group members <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> contributions are essential for the group’s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{can cause}} serious {{addiction}} problems. A survey of doctors in Senegal {{found that many}} doctors <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> training and knowledge of benzodiazepines is, in general, poor; a study in Dakar found that almost one-fifth of doctors ignored prescribing guidelines regarding short-term use of benzodiazepines, and almost three-quarters of doctors regarded their training and knowledge of benzodiazepines to be inadequate. More training regarding benzodiazepines has been recommended for doctors. Due to the serious concerns of addiction, national governments were recommended to urgently seek to raise knowledge via training about the addictive nature of benzodiazepines and appropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Parents may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{authority}} over their children is weakened {{because there are}} greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice. In particular, children in immigrant families may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see Second generation immigrants in the United States).|$|E

25|$|People with SPD are {{sometimes}} sexually apathetic, {{though they do}} not typically suffer from anorgasmia. Their preference to remain alone and detached may cause their need for sex {{to appear to be}} less than that of those who do not have SPD. Sex often causes individuals with SPD to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> personal space is being violated, and they commonly feel that masturbation or sexual abstinence is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex. Significantly broadening this picture are notable exceptions of SPD individuals who engage in occasional or even frequent sexual activities with others.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may feel as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel {{they know what they}} mean and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

This {{may be the case}} when the narcissist {{experiences}} a [...] "fall from grace", such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed, or when their importance is brought into question. Narcissistic injury is a cause of distress and can lead to dysregulation of behaviors as in narcissistic rage.|$|R

25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she is}} being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|In {{late medieval}} times a {{population}} increase and {{an expansion of}} church building took place in Great Britain inevitably encroaching on the territories of existing mother churches or minsters. Demands for autonomy from outlying settlements made minster officials <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> authority was waning, as were their revenues, so they instituted corpse roads connecting outlying locations and their mother churches (at the heart of parishes) that alone held burial rights. For some parishioners, this decision meant that corpses had to be transported long distances, sometimes through difficult terrain: usually a corpse had to be carried unless the departed was a wealthy individual. An example would be the funeral way that runs from Rydal to Ambleside in the Lake District where a coffin stone (illustrated above right), on which the coffin was placed while the parishioners rested, still exists. Many of the 'new' churches were eventually granted burial rights and corpse roads ceased {{to be used as}} such.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song begin with the song's protagonist {{wondering}} if he should express his feelings to a girl. He describes how unique the girl is, such as that her beauty is [...] "the greatest genetic change of this century." [...] The pair begin to date, and the protagonist begins {{to think about the}} relationship. At first, he states how he cannot believe in miracles, but <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> him meeting his lover makes him want to believe in miracles. He <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> relationship is beautiful and wonderful, because his lover calls it a miracle.|$|R

In the other she remains with Lawrence though increasingly <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> relationship is going nowhere. The two narratives intersect periodically as both personal and international events (such as the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and the September 11 attacks) intervene and the final chapter is indeed shared by both narratives...|$|R
5000|$|Julia Serano {{has defined}} cissexual as [...] "people {{who are not}} {{transsexual}} and who have only ever experienced their mental and physical sexes as being aligned", while cisgender is a slightly narrower term {{for those who do}} not identify as transgender (a larger cultural category than the more clinical transsexual). For Jessica Cadwallader, cissexual is [...] "a way of drawing attention to the unmarked norm, against which trans is identified, in which a person <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> gender identity matches their body/sex".|$|R
