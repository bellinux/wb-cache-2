40|$|Abstract This study investigates whether ambitions amongst nascent {{entrepreneurs}} regarding innovativeness {{matter for}} the national level of innovativeness. We link ambitious nascent entrepreneurship to the national level of innovativeness for 36 countries, {{using data from the}} Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. We find a significant positive relation between the level of nascent entrepreneurs who intend to offer a product or service that is new to all or to some of their customers and the national technology level. This may suggest that ambitions to offer new products or services tend to contribute to higher levels of competition and knowledge spillovers, and consequently to the emergence of highly <b>innovative</b> <b>economies.</b> Our results also suggest that this relationship is less strong in poor countries. ...|$|R

30|$|This {{relationship}} between education and labor productivity is complex, especially {{when considering the}} influence of technology and physical capital. Technological progress itself {{does not come from}} heaven, but is the result of new vintages of human or physical capital with higher productivity levels (Solow 1956; Swan 1956; Grossman and Helpman 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1995 and Aghion and Howitt 1998). At the same time, the changes in the productivity levels of new vintages of physical capital could be the result of the involvement of knowledge workers in the production process. This is the reason why we also use employment in knowledge intensive activities as a proxy for the innovation in a country because we assume that <b>innovative</b> <b>economies</b> have a broader knowledge intensive industry than other economies.|$|R
