5|$|Non-{{professional}} phagocytes {{are more}} limited than professional phagocytes {{in the type}} of particles they can take up. This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular opsonins—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions {{are similar}} to Hawaiian eruptions, but there are differences. Strombolian eruptions are noisier, produce no {{sustained}} eruptive columns, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> some volcanic products associated with Hawaiian volcanism (specifically Pele's tears and Pele's hair), and produce fewer molten lava flows (although the eruptive material does tend to form small rivulets).|$|E

5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to single}} interstitials, divacancies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900°C {{creating}} multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, {{they have not}} been detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Females can lay five {{clutches}} per year, but two is {{a normal}} average after including the 30–50% of a population's females that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any clutches in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the two more southerly subspecies, southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.|$|E

5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce,</b> or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|The broader {{definition}} differs {{mainly in}} including plants that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> their own digestive enzymes but rely on internal food webs or microbes to digest prey, such as Darlingtonia and some species of Heliamphora. The original definition of botanical carnivory, {{set out in}} Givnish et. al. (1984), required a plant to exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey while gaining a fitness advantage through the absorption of nutrients derived from said prey. Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for digestion.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration that reflects ambient light, such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that flicker in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E
5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> offspring.|$|E

The term murmur only refers to a sound believed to originate within blood flow through or near the heart; rapid blood velocity is necessary to produce a murmur. It should be noted that most heart problems <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> any murmur and most valve problems also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> an audible murmur.|$|E
