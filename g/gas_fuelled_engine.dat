This paper {{presents}} {{characteristics of}} a new catalytic converter (catco) {{to be used for}} natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine.</b> The catco were developed based on cata-lyst materials consisting of metal oxides such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and cobalt oxide (CoO) with wire mesh substrate. Both of the catalyst materials (such as TiO 2 and CoO) are inexpensive in comparison with conventional catalysts (noble met-als) such as palladium or platinum. In addition, the noble metals such as platinum group metals are now identified as human health risk due to their rapid emissions in the environment from various resources like conventional catalytic converter, jewelers and other medical usages. It can be mentioned that the TiO 2 /CoO based catalytic converter and a new natural gas engine such as compressed natural gas (CNG) direct injection (DI) engine were developed under a research collaboration program. The original engine manufacture catalytic conveter (OEM catco) was tested for comparison purposes. The OEM catco was based on noble metal catalyst with honeycomb ceramic substrate. It is experimentally found that the conversion efficiencies of TiO 2 /CoO based catalytic converter are 93 %, 89 % and 82 % fo...|$|E

A new method to predict the trends of MFB and emissions, based on the online analysis of cylinder pressure is introduced.

Natural gas fuelled vehicles are environmentally friendly and it is possible to use a high compression ratio engine with all its associated benefits for efficiency.

The stability problem can be resolved by the addition of hydrogen, which can be provided by fuel reforming. Based on the beneficial effects of exhaust gas fuel reforming, the effects of EGR, H 2 and H 2 /CO as additives to natural gas are analysed and discussed in terms of combustion indicators derived by the new diagnostic method, in particular in terms of combustion duration (CA for 5 / 50 / 95...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Natural gas is gaining popularity as a fuel for automobile applications. In order to procure all the benefits of using natural gas, dedicated engines optimised for this fuel are needed. It is necessary to validate multi-dimensional models of combustion of natural gas in SI engines as such models provide a powerful tool in designing engines and optimising them for this fuel and for studying the emission of pollutants. The multi-dimensional CFD code, KN A-IT, {{has been used in}} this study, with necessary modifications and additions. Several combustion models commonly used for SI engine modelling in CFD environments were evaluated. It was concluded that flamelet combustion models are more suitable for engine combustion modelling as engine combustion, in almost all cases, lies within the flamelet regime of combustion. One such flamelet model, the Fractal Flame Model (FFM), was improved, implemented and validated for simulating the turbulent phase of the combustion process in a spark ignited, natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine.</b> The model validation was done by comparing predictions with experimental data for the base line case. This validated model was then used to study the effects of engine operating parameters and combustion chamber geometry on engine performance and emissions thus providing a suitable analytical background for the designing of dedicated engines optimised for natural gas. This parametric study was performed over a range of air/fuel ratios, with ignition timing, compression ratio and engine speed as the variable parameters. The trends predicted were used to assess the predictive capabilities of the FFM. Eddy break up model (EBUM) was used to compare the predictions by the FFM and these comparisons indicated that the FFM resulted in better agreement with experiments. The predicted trends of engine performance and pollutant formation with the FFM agree well with those found in the literature. This indicates the strength of the FFM as a combustion model for natural gas fuelled SI engines. The effects of the combustion chamber geometry and exhaust gas recirculation on engine performance and pollutant formation were numerically studied and the trends obtained agree with experimental data available. The Renormalisation Group Theory (RNG) k-ε turbulence model was compared with the standard k-ε model and no significant effect on results was found...|$|E

Results from this study demonstrate that Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP), it’s Coefficient Of Variation (COV), in cylinder pressure history, heat release rate and mass burn fraction all depend on the relative air fuel ratio (λ) and engine speed. With an increase in engine speed, the λ limit need to be increased so that the COV to remain well below 10 %. However, the IMEP was found to decrease with an increase in λ.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{alternative}} fuels {{has led to}} the use of <b>gas</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines.</b> Liquefied petroleum <b>gas</b> and especially natural gas are already widespread because they increase the energy security, have a higher knocking resistance and give lower CO 2 and noxious emissions. They are still fossil fuels so sustainable alternatives like hydrogen are also investigated. A thermodynamic model of the engine cycle enables a cheap and fast optimization of engine settings. Modelling the heat transfer from the burning gases to the cylinder walls in a sub model is an indispensable keystone. Existing heat transfer models from Annand and Woschni were developed for diesel and gasoline and need to be validated for gaseous fuels. We have measured the heat flux and the wall temperature in an engine that can run on methane and hydrogen. This paper describes an evaluation of the models of Annand and Woschni with those heat flux measurements. Both models can be calibrated to account for the influence of the specific engine geometry on the heat transfer. But if they are calibrated for methane, they fail to calculate the heat transfer for hydrogen combustion. This demonstrates the models lack some gas or combustion properties which influence the heat transfer process in the case of hydrogen combustion...|$|R

In addition to the mean yearly concentrations, the hourly limit values for the protection of human health are also taken into account: the 18 th maximum hourly concentration is considered. The main steps necessary to characterize a districtheating plant are shown and twocase-studies are discussed. As far as the energetic aspects are concerned, these new plants always offer a primary energy saving, and the globalenvironmentaleffects are improved due to a reduction in CO 2. Local NOx emissions of a future plant do not decrease with respect to the existing emissions, and this aspect is closely connected to the type of CHP unit that is adopted (in this paper, natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines).</b> The localenvironmentaleffects due to NOx are estimated using a dispersion model, and the NOx concentrations (annual mean value and maximum hourly value) introduced by the new plant and those avoided through the non-use of existing domestic boilers are compared. For one of the case-studies emerges that some zones do not satisfy ambient air quality limits. For these reasons, a higher stack has been assumed for this critical case and the new results show that a reduction in the frequency of the overcomings, which is in agreement with expectations, can thus be obtained. The analysed case-studies have shown that even a small CHP districtheating plant can produce critical aspects and a pollutant concentration analysis is a useful tool to check localenvironmental aspect...|$|R

Computational Fluid Dynamics model with integrated chemistry solver is utilized and methane is used as surrogate of natural gas fuel.

(2000), conducted on the single cylinder Volvo TD 100 engine operating at Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition conditions. After verification of model predictions using in-cylinder pressure histories, the effect of varying equivalence ratio and engine speed on combustion parameters of the engine is studied. Results indicate that increasing engine speed provides shorter time for combustion at the same equivalence ratio such that at higher engine speeds, with constant equivalence ratio, combustion misfires. At lower engine speed, ignition delay is shortened and combustion advances. It was observed that increasing the equivalence ratio retards the combustion due to compressive heating effect {{in one of the}} test cases at lower initial pressure.

40|$|Natural gas, {{which is}} {{primarily}} composed of methane, o ers many advantages over other hydrocarbon fuels {{for use in}} reciprocating piston engines. Generally, these include: a high octane rating, wide ammability limits, a high gravimetric energy content, reduced CO 2 output, {{and lower levels of}} harmful exhaust gas emissions. However, natural gas presents some unique challenges due to its low density and slow laminar burning velocity. The former causes issues with volumetric e ciency and/or charge homogeneity depending on the fuel delivery method. The latter results in prolonged combustion durations that are counter-productive to high fuel conversion e ciencies. A split-cycle engine divides the conventional four-stroke engine process between two adjoining cylinders: one cylinder for intake and compression, the second cylinder for combustion and exhaust. The passage that connects these two cylinders together provides an alternative location for fuel injection and mixing. Furthermore, the uid exchange process occurring from this passage to the combustion chamber is a source of turbulence generation desired to enhance the rate of combustion.

A system using a flame-arrester type of flame-holder to stabilize the flame and an ejector system for the recirculation of combustion gas was designed and tested in the laboratory. The impact of changes in different parameters of the ejector system was examined. Different combinations of recirculation rate and air/fuel ratio were examined regarding their impact on emissions and flame stability. The laboratory combustion system was then adapted to commercial combustors. A propane combustion system for a hybrid sodium heat pipe solar receiver for the SOLO 161 Stirling engine was designed, built and field-tested with good results. Later a natural gas combustor for a SOLO 161 {{combined heat and power}} Stirling engine unit was designed, built and field-tested with good results. The combustor has currently run about 2500 hours in field test. At lambda 1. 4 the NOX emissions are about 15 ppm, with no emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC). Tests have been made with a catalytically coated solar receiver for the V 160 Stirling engine with the objective to use catalytic combustion on the heater surface to supply heat to the Stirling cycle.

Air standard assumptions were taken consideration for the analyses. MEP, power output and torque for all alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines,</b> are higher compared to that of a gasoline engine.

This study investigates the effects of <b>fuelling</b> a heavy-duty <b>engine</b> {{with a mixture of}} hydrogen and natural gas injected directly into the combustion chamber. The combustion system, developed for natural <b>gas</b> <b>fuelling,</b> is not modified for blended hydrogen operation. The results demonstrate that hydrogen can have a significant beneficial effect in reducing emissions without affecting efficiency or requiring significant engine modifications. Combustion stability is enhanced through the higher reactivity of the hydrogen, resulting in reduced emissions of unburned methane. The fuel’s lower carbon:energy ratio also reduces CO 2 emissions. These results combine to significantly reduce tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the effect on net GHG’s, including both tailpipe and fuelproduction emissions, depends on the source of the hydrogen.

These lines are of great interest since they emanate from gas close to the central supermassive black hole and this gas {{may be related to}} the <b>gas</b> <b>fuelling</b> the central <b>engine.</b> Many fundamental questions about the nature of the “broad-line region” (BLR) structure, and its kinematics have remained unanswered. We have used state-of-the-art photoionization models to interpret a combination of Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectra and ground-based optical spectra to deduce the conditions in the BLR as a function of velocity. There has been a long-standing discrepancy between the densities deduced from studies of the variability of quasar emission lines and those inferred from standard photoionization analyses. We find that the higher metal abundances now believed to be present in most quasars lead to higher densities being predicted by photoionization models. It has been suggested that the highest-velocity gas is optically thin. We show that this presents many problems and that instead the line ratios arise naturally in an optically-thick component. This model successfully explains the line ratios and their variability. We present evidence that the highest velocity blueshifted gas shows the self-absorption expected for outflowing gas. For high-ionization lines we show that both the density and ionizing photon flux are independent of the velocity. This strongly rules out models in which the motion of this gas is gravitationally dominated but is consistent with models where the motion arises from a wind. However, for the low-ionization gas we find that both the density and the ionizing photon flux increase with velocity. The increase in ionizing photon flux is consistent with what is expected from low-ionization virialized gas illuminated by a point source. Our studies strongly support the idea that there are two different components to the BLR: a high-ionization wind component and a low-ionization gravitationally-bound component. The low-ionization component is probably associated with a disk. ...|$|R

40|$|Transport is a {{major source}} of the {{particle}} pollution (PM). Combustion engine particulate emissions have the potential cause adverse health effects. These effects include cancer and other pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. A substantial proportion of the number of particles, but not the mass, is ultrafine. For example – one million particles of 100 nanometers size with a unit density of 1 g/cm 3 have a mass of approximately 0. 0005 g. The paper includes research results of mass and number concentration of nanoPM for 1. 9 TDI VW exhaust <b>gases</b> <b>fuelled</b> by standard diesel. The measurements were performed for ambient air and 3 different point of engine work (idle speed, low and high load at 2000 rpm). For nanoPM measurements was used Electrical Low Pressure Impactor ELPI from DECATI, was found, among other things, that the biggest mass concentration was at 0. 1 - 10 Pm of PM diameter but the biggest number concentration was at 0, 01 – 0, 1 Pm and thus for the size of solid particles of at least an order of magnitude smaller than the mass concentration. The biggest the negative differences in the mass concentration occur in the exhaust gases of the RME <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine</b> (in comparison with diesel fuel) at engine idling when the smallest injection pressure and temperature inside the engine cylinder exist and the oxygen availability is also the lowest (because of the small charging pressure and high EGR rate). Such measurements are important {{not only in terms of}} utilitarian but also in cognitive sense – for determining the effect of the engine construction parameters and/or regulating the engine (or the fuel composition) on the mass and the number of nanoparticles emitted in the exhaust gases...|$|R
50|$|Narayanan {{introduced}} the liquid fuel rocket technology in India {{in the early}} 1970s, when A. P. J. Abdul Kalam’s team was working on solid motors. He foresaw the need for liquid <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines</b> for ISRO’s future civilian space programmes. He was encouraged by the then ISRO chairman Satish Dhawan, and his successor U.R. Rao. Narayanan developed liquid propellant motors, first building the successful 600-kg thrust engine in the mid-1970s and thereafter moving on to bigger engines.|$|R
