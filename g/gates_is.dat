He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.

5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several <b>gates</b> <b>is</b> debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E

5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of <b>Gates</b> <b>is</b> a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has been {{transformed}} into a major commercial destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Street is {{situated}} along the northwestern {{side of the}} island, in an historic district known as Old Town Key West. Part of the district, roughly defined as the area between Caroline Street and Angela Streets (which run parallel about four blocks apart), harbors many old houses, some of which belonged to famous writers and other influential persons. For example, the Dr. Joseph Y. Porter House at 429 Caroline Street was home to the first public health inspector {{in the state of}} Florida. The Porter House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Many of the houses in the area have been converted into inns; the Curry Mansion Inn at the corner of Caroline and Ann streets was originally built in 1855 for the Currys, a prominent local family. At Caroline Street's southern terminus across from the Presidential <b>Gates</b> <b>is</b> the Airways Building, which served as the original Pan American World Airways office during its formation in 1927.|$|E
