5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for <b>hedging</b> <b>purposes.</b> The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

We find that the relationships between bank total risk and derivative usage are slightly negative, but without statistical significance. The usage of derivatives with <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose,</b> however, reduces bank total risk. The results indicate that the use of derivative as a whole has no impact on bank risk, but the use of under hedging accounting reduces the level of bank risk. We find that the usage of interest rate swaps with <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose</b> reduces bank total risk. We also find that the demand for interest rate swaps is generally higher by banks with a higher ratio of the long term Japanese government bonds (JGBs).

40|$|Longevity {{phenomenon}} is a relevant aspect for insurance companies which {{are obliged to}} quantify the impact of uncertainty of mortality trend on issued products, in order to manage the risk derived from it. Recently, significant tools {{have been developed for}} transferring longevity risk to the capital markets, bringing additional capacity, flex- ibility and transparency to complement existing insurance solutions. In particular, hedging longevity risk with index-based longevity hedges can have several advantages. Nevertheless, the difference between the in- surer’s mortality experience based on annuitant mortality and the hedged standardized index based on reference population mortality give rise to the so-called basis risk. The presence of basis risk means that hedge ef- fectiveness will not be perfect and that, post implementation, the hedged position will still have some residual risk. The present paper seeks to con- tribute to that literature by setting out a framework for quantifying the basis risk.

I found out that the use of financial derivatives by BA is for <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose,</b> but not for speculative or trading purposes. BA is facing financing and interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk and other risks. Therefore, BA employs a mixture of swaps, options, forward and futures to hedge against these risks. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against near-term foreign exchange risk, uses interest rate swaps to hedge against financing and interest rate risks, and uses a number of derivatives that are available the over the counter markets (such as options and forward contracts). During the financial year of 2006, the derivatives used by BA were generally found to be effective. Moreover, a numerical example is used to show how forward/futures and options can protect BA against the movement of fuel price risk. More importantly, using this example, I found out that BA is better off by using option market hedge...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the optimal responses of a risk-averse corn producer to price and quantity risks within a framework where both futures and option contracts are available as risk management tools. The corn farmer is selected as a representative decision maker because corn is the most important crop in Iowa;Numerical techniques are used to solve the expected utility maximization problem for the corn producer. In forming his subjective probability distributions about random variables, the farmer is assumed to predicate output which will be sell to cash market at a later date and use futures and put options to hedge against the risk associated with his cash position. To decide the optimal hedging strategy, the farmer also makes predictions on the cash, futures, and option prices prevailing at the end of period. Optimal positions are obtained for three scenarios: (1) the producer considers only futures, (2) the producer considers only put options, (3) the producer considers both futures and put options as risk management tools. Comparative static results regarding the impact of model parameters such as frame size, risk attitudes, price levels, and price variances on the optimal solution are then examined. The access values of futures, options, and futures-and-options added to the producer are computed based on the concept of certainty equivalent;The optimal solution indicates that put options are used not only as for <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose</b> but also as speculative tools. From hedging standpoint, however, the option market offers no additional benefit to the expected utility maximizing producer if futures contracts are already in use;The access values added to the corn producer show that the futures contracts have a greater value to the producer than does the option contracts. The primary factors determining the access value of options are farm size, the variability of prices, and the level of risk aversion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Banks have twin {{objectives}} of maximizing profitability {{and at the}} same time trying to ensure sufficient liquidity. To achieve these objectives, it is essential that banks have to monitor, maintain and manage their assets and liabilities portfolios in a systematic manner taking into account the various risks involved in these areas. Balance sheet risk can be categorized into two major types of significant risks, which are liquidity risk and interest rate risk (IRR). Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. For measuring interest rate risk, banks use a variety of method such as gap analysis, the duration gap method, the basis point value (BPV) method, and simulation methods. The need to manage IRR arises as its management is critical to the overall profitability of banks and they have started using derivative instruments such as interest rate swap, interest rate futures, and forward rate agreements. Hence, the present study entitled “On the Determinants of Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Usage by Indian Banks ” has been taken up to model the factors which determine the use of interest rate swap to manage IRR. The sample for this study includes 24 Indian Commercial Banks and it used annual data for the financial year 2007 - 08. For this purpose, the bank specific characteristics such as size, asset quality, capitalization, profitability, interest rate risk profile are regressed against the notional amount of the interest rate swap reported for hedging activities. It is found that the larger banks (as explained by the total assets) and profitable banks (as explained by the profit before tax to total asset ratio) do not seem to have any comparative advantage to use interest rate swaps for <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose</b> more intensively than smaller banks. Further, it is found that the banks with more exposure to interest rate risk, high net worth, and higher loans to asset ratio tend to be larger users of interest rate swaps...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{study the}} risk-return {{characteristics}} {{in the time}} series of a broad collection of hedge funds from the TASS database, especially their exposure to aggregate volatility risk and whether their returns resemble a position in index options. Earlier research has suggested a non-linear relation between the returns of hedge funds {{and those of the}} market index akin to a short position in an index put option. We find no evidence of such a relation, as hedge funds have no exposure whatsoever to factors proxying for the returns of call or put index options. However, hedge funds exhibit non-linearity with respect to the market in way of a negative aggregate volatility beta, where volatility risk is proxied by an index straddle. Earlier literature having established a negative volatility risk premium, our results suggest that hedge funds perform well during times of low and expected volatility, while performing poorly when the volatility of the market rises. The volatility exposure is both statistically and economically significant, with one standard deviation change in the monthly return of the straddle factor being associated with 0. 25 percentage points in the monthly return of the aggregate hedge fund index. We also study whether hedge funds’ direct use of options as investments has an effect on these measures. We divide funds into option users and non-users and find that, in the aggregate, option users have a larger (less negative) volatility beta. This suggests options being used with a <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose,</b> although our binary measure of option use leaves much to be desired in determining the exact source of this difference. Finally, we sort funds into deciles based on their historical volatility betas, and find that funds with more negative volatility exposure consistently beat their less-negative counterparts in terms of both Sharpe ratios and alphas, with a spread portfolio of low-minus-high beta funds having an annual alpha of 5. 3 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years {{significant}} tools {{have been developed for}} transferring longevity risk to the capital markets, bringing additional capacity, flexibility and transparency to complement existing insurance solutions. Specifically, hedging longevity risk with index-based longevity hedges can have several advantages but the difference between the insurer’s mortality experience based on annuitant mortality and the hedged standardized index based on reference population mortality gives rise to the so-called basis risk. The presence of basis risk means that hedge effectiveness will not be perfect and that, post implementation, the hedged position will still have some residual risk. The present paper seeks to contribute to that literature by setting out a framework for quantifying the basis risk. In particular we propose a model that measure the population basis risk involved in a longevity hedge, in the functional demographic model (FDM) setting. The literature suggests that the FDM forecast accuracy is arguably connected to the model structure, combining functional data analysis, nonparametric smoothing and robust statistics. In particular, the decomposition of the fitted curve via basis functions represents the advantage, since they capture the variability of the mortality trend, by separating out the effects of several orthogonal components. Specifically, while most existing models are designed for a single population the research objective is to model mortality of two populations as in Li and Hardy (2011) in order to align with the <b>hedging</b> <b>purpose.</b> Under the proposed mortality model, we develop an optimal longevity hedging strategy involving mortality linked securities and following the immunization theory approach. We firstly assume no difference between the two population mortalities (no basis risk) and we show as such a strategy could be not perfectly effective when difference in the reference population respect to mortality index’ one emerges and basis risk is measured. Afterwards an optimal hedging strategies is developed explicitly including basis risk. We show as the longevity hedging could be more effective although still not perfect...|$|R
