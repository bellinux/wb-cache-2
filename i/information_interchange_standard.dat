The Version 3 effort {{represents a}} transformation {{of the way that}} HL 7 and its Technical Committees will develop future HL 7 <b>information</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>standards.</b> This transformation involves applying object-oriented modelling to the development and specification of <b>information</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>standards.</b> This paper discusses the rationale that led HL 7 to undertake this change and provides an overview of the Version 3 Message Development Framework which is HL 7 â€™s new methodology.

At the earlier phase, the language or media of storing data on computer was restricted to English language because of ASCII(American <b>Standard</b> for <b>Information</b> <b>Interchange)</b> <b>standards</b> developed by Bell laboratories. But as the computerization or automation increased {{in the field of}} business, banking, insurance, e-governance, e-books, e-commerce etc. it creates a new challenge to store different types of data(text/audio/video/images etc) in different volumes(quantity), also the network communication. This challenge spawns different areas in IT industry like data warehousing, data mining, www, networking, computer security etc. But the present study focuses on the area whic...|$|R
40|$|Library Trends last {{considered}} {{issues of}} library cooperation and resource sharing in volume 45, number 3, {{in the winter}} of 1997. There have been many important developments related to this far-reaching topic since then. This issue explores the theme that through cooperation, aided by technology, libraries are being bound ever more closely together. They are increasingly becoming nodes in a common information network. The issue takes a broad approach in order to explore many diverse aspects of library sharing and cooperation and the many ways in which libraries are working more closely together. I have provided a summary of some of the factors drawing libraries together. These include the benefits of sharing new technology, new and increasingly detailed <b>information</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>standards,</b> and informal software and programming standards. New Web-based centralized resources for sharing library holdings and indexing information are rapidly developing. New widely shared services like virtual reference are also emerging. New partnerships???between libraries, between information companies, and between vendors and libraries and other organizations???are also bringing information services together in a variety of new ways. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

The objective of the study is to explain the algorithm by which any computer user can communicate with computer in his/her mother tongue like (Marathi/Hindi/Sanskrit/Gujarati hundreds of Languages across the world) This is implemented by using UNICODE(Universal Code) which was introduced in 1988. But UNICODE could not become so popular as it was expected. We have implemented an algorithm and program in C#. net by which Computer user can customize the keystrokes of keyboards to match the keystroke of their mother tongue. He can create multiple keyboard layouts for many languages. This is immensely helpful for all the users from KG to PG and research, because language will not be the barrier for learning the use and usage of Computer...|$|R
40|$|E-commerce creates {{opportunities}} {{for companies to}} implement internal and external connections. This establishes new capabilities to meet market needs and changes the way business can be conducted through the redefinition of rules and roles in the extended enterprise. The literature suggests that the emergence of Internet / Web based communities of common interest accelerates this shift towards {{the concept of the}} extended enterprise by enabling enterprises to align within a series of 'value networks' against other groups of enterprises. A collaborative approach and shared benefits are among the crucial factors which bind these value networks of closely integrated business communities. This study investigates the cultural and organisational context of implementing e-commerce to support business to business collaborative relationships. Using primarily qualitative and exploratory methods, various interrelationships are explored through two in depth case studies. The research approach is structured by underpinning theories, predominantly transaction cost economics, and informed by key findings from the literature search of the topic domain. The research itself {{is based on the assumption}} that collaborative e-commerce cannot be considered in a vacuum and that a holistic perspective is required, particularly in considering the socio-political and relational aspects of such inter-organisational systems. The work undertaken therefore seeks to identify the interrelationships between the IT, organisational and business aspects of collaborative business to business relationships. The research concludes that a number of interdependent factors are key in implementing e-commerce to support collaborative relationships. Foremost among these are the redesign of processes and practices, common <b>information</b> <b>interchange</b> <b>standards</b> and support, a consultative approach based on mutual trust, the sharing of benefits and a willingness to learn and to adopt a 'network' perspective. The findings are encapsulated into an e-commerce/collaborative relationship framework developed by incorporating key findings from the case studies, as well as themes from the literature. This framework may be a useful tool for analysis in other case studies and could be refined and enhanced by further such research...|$|R
40|$|A limited list of (Read coded) {{pathology}} investigations, {{the so-called}} 'bounded list', {{has been used}} since 1996 in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) messages sent from laboratories to GP surgeries. It was developed {{as part of the}} General Practice Provider Links (GPPL) project, and this trial work, together with use of the list outside these projects suggested a need to expand the list. This work has been carried out as part of the Pathology Messaging Enabler Project and involved a collaboration between the NHS <b>Information</b> Authority (Data <b>Interchange</b> <b>Standards</b> Programme and Coding and Classification) along with representatives from the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Royal College of Pathologists. In this paper we explain the contribution of the bounded list to quality in pathology messaging, and we describe the processes used to identify and select the terms required and the incorporation of these terms into an appropriate structure...|$|R
