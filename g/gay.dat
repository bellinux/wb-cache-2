5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major <b>gay</b> character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be <b>gay</b> from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be <b>gay</b> in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to <b>gay</b> teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another <b>gay</b> teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows <b>gay</b> men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly <b>gay</b> and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on <b>gay</b> and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on <b>gay</b> service {{did not have any}} negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E

Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson <b>Gay,</b> encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood. There was strong competition between the two, and <b>Gay</b> later said that his sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E

Neighbours has featured a few short-term or minor male <b>gay</b> characters before for plot points or small story arcs, but Chris is the first male <b>gay</b> character {{to be given a}} prominent role. The first minor male <b>gay</b> characters to appear were Andrew MacKenzie (John Morris) and Alf Taylor (Frank Bren) in 1994. The following year a <b>gay</b> schoolteacher, Andrew Watson (Chris Uhlman), became the victim of a dismissal campaign by his pupils. Hairdresser Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) was often hinted at being <b>gay.</b>|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's <b>gay</b> community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, <b>gay</b> men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with <b>gay</b> men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by <b>gay</b> men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone <b>gay</b> men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, <b>gay</b> men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gay</b> {{characters}} became common {{enough that}} Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide To Fantasyland contains an entry on <b>gay</b> mages as a fantasy cliché.

A very strong voice in <b>gay</b> literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his <b>gay</b> radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the <b>gay</b> community itself.|$|E
50|$|Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against <b>gays,</b> {{lesbians and}} transgendered people.

50|$|WIS 131 {{was first}} {{designated}} between 1924 and 1927 on a route from WIS 35 near Ferryville to WIS 11 in <b>Gays</b> Mills. When WIS 11 {{was assigned to}} a different route before 1927, WIS 131 took on its route from <b>Gays</b> Mills north to WIS 27 in Soldiers Grove. WIS 131 was extended further northward to La Farge in 1939 after a county highway was transferred to state control. In 1947, WisDOT switched the designations of WIS 131 and WIS 171 south and west of <b>Gays</b> Mills; WIS 131 was designated between <b>Gays</b> Mills and Wauzeka, and its original route between Ferryville and <b>Gays</b> Mills became WIS 171.

5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, <b>gay</b> community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in <b>gay</b> rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to <b>gay</b> men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many <b>gay</b> men had migrated to the Castro, and for what <b>gay</b> rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected <b>gay</b> men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the <b>gay</b> men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
