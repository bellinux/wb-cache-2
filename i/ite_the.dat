30|$|As an {{important}} type of functions defined by translations, almost periodic functions on time scales {{have been paid}} much attention to. In the literature works [11, 22], the authors studied almost periodic solutions of differential equations on certain time scales with transition conditions (DETC) {{on the basis of}} reduction to the impulsive differential equations (<b>ITE).</b> <b>The</b> authors employed the reversible translation transform of time scales to turn the time scale into the real line, then the differential equations on time scales can be changed into a traditional impulsive differential equations on R simultaneously. Finally, they established an equivalence between DETC and traditional ITE on R. Their results mainly contribute to building a relationship between DETC and ITE, and through investigating the almost periodic solutions for <b>ITE,</b> <b>the</b> corresponding almost periodic solutions for DETC can be indirectly studied. However, they did not consider to directly use the Δ-calculus theory on time scales to solve the almost periodic problems of differential equations on time scales since many time scales are not completely closed under translations, which will lead to the functions defined by translations being not well defined on time scales. Therefore, it was difficult to consider almost periodic problem on time scales directly through Δ-calculus theory then.|$|E
