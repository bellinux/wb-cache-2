The relationship between CR and U is different in the two <b>flume</b> <b>tanks,</b> however {{there appears to be a}} straightforward unimodal trend between CR and shear velocity (U*).

This provides new evidence on how endobenthic organisms can affect the BBL. However, the influence of CR on U* could not be quantified because these parameters have interactive effects that cannot be dissociated. ...|$|R

40|$|Dispersal, one of {{the most}} {{important}} processes in population ecology, is an issue linking physiological and behavioral features. However, the endocrine control of animal dispersal remains poorly understood. Here, we tested whether and how thyroid hormones may influence dispersal in glass eels of Anguilla anguilla, by testing their influence on locomotor activity and rheotactic behavior. Glass eels were caught during their estuarine migration and treated by immersion in either a l-thyroxine (T 4) or a thiourea (TU) solution. As measured by radioimmunoassay, T 4 and TU treatments induced, respectively, increased and decreased whole-body thyroid hormone levels relative to untreated controls. We tested a total of 960 glass eels distributed into control, and T 4 and TU treatment groups, on their swimming behavior in experimental <b>flume</b> <b>tanks</b> equipped with upstream and downstream traps that allowed us to concurrently measure both the locomotor activity and the rheotactic behavior. Compared to controls, locomotor activity significantly increased among the hyperthyroid, T 4 -treated eels, but significantly decreased among the hypothyroid, TU-treated eels. The results on rheotactic behavior suggested a more complex regulatory mechanism, since TU but not T 4 treatment significantly affected rheotactic behavior. The influence of thyroid hormones on locomotor activity suggests a central role for these hormones in the regulation of mechanisms leading to the colonization of continental habitats by glass eels. Thyroid hormones are also implicated in the control of locomotor activity in mammals and migratory behavior in birds, suggesting that these hormones represent conserved, proximate mediators of dispersal in vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Pacific salmon migrations {{represent}} one of {{the most}} complex and intriguing biological phenomena in the animal kingdom particularly as the inability to reach spawning grounds results in zero lifetime fitness given their semelparous life history. In this presentation I review some key findings from our past 10 years of research involving the study of behavior, physiology and survival of up-river migrating adult sockeye salmon. Using physiological and conventional telemetry in field studies, and intervention experiments in laboratory <b>flumes</b> and <b>tanks,</b> we have discovered that when faced with challenging conditions towards the end of their migratory period (e. g. high or turbulent flows, high temperatures, confinement) females suffer 2 - 5 X higher mortality than males. Such elevated mortality in females has been observed for sockeye passing through a fishway located within a short distance of spawning grounds. The causes of this phenomenon are still unclear though maturing female sockeye salmon maintain higher levels of circulating plasma cortisol compared to males, and we suspect that females could be immunocompromised and less resistant to pathogens whose rates of development are accelerated by stressful migratory conditions. The broader implications of this to fishway passage and reproductive success will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Swim speed during diving has {{important}} energetic consequences. Not only do costs increase as drag rises non-linearly with increasing speed, but speed also affects travel time to foraging patches and therefore {{time and energy}} budgets over the entire dive cycle. However, diving behaviour has rarely been considered in relation to current velocity. Strong tidal currents around the Belcher Islands, Nunavut, Canada, produce polynyas, persistent areas of open water in the sea ice which are important habitats for wildlife wintering in Hudson Bay. Some populations of common eiders Somateria mollissima sedentaria remain in polynyas through the winter where they dive to forage on benthic invertebrates. Strong tidal currents keep polynyas from freezing, but current velocity can exceed 1. 5 m s¿ 1 and could influence time and energy costs of diving and foraging. Polynyas therefore provide naturally occurring <b>flume</b> <b>tanks</b> allowing investigation of diving strategies of free ranging birds in relation to current velocity. We used a custom designed sub-sea ice camera to non-invasively investigate over 150 dives {{to a depth of}} 11. 3 m by a population of approximately 100 common eiders at Ulutsatuq polynya during February and March of 2002 and 2003. Current speed during recorded dives ranged from 0 to 1 m s¿ 1. As currents increased, vertical descent speed of eiders decreased, while descent duration and the number of wing strokes and foot strokes during descent to the bottom increased. However, nearly simultaneous strokes of wings and feet, and swim speed relative to the moving water, were maintained within a narrow range (2. 28 ± 0. 23 Hz; 1. 25 ± 0. 14 m s¿ 1, respectively). This close regulation of swim speed over a range in current speed of 1. 0 m s¿ 1 might correspond to efficient muscle contraction rates, and probably reduces work rates by avoiding rapidly increasing drag at greater speeds; however, it also increases travel time to benthic foraging patches. Despite regulation of average swim speed, high instantaneous speeds during oscillatory stroking can increase dive costs due to drag. While most diving birds have been considered either foot or wing propelled, eider ducks used both wing and foot propulsion during descent. Our observations indicate that the power phase of foot strokes coincides with the transition between upstroke and downstroke of the wings, when drag is greatest. Coordinated timing between foot and wing propulsion could therefore serve to maintain a steadier speed during descent and decrease the costs of diving. Despite tight regulation of stroke and swim speed patterns, descent duration and total number of foot and wing strokes during descent increase non-linearly with increasing current velocity, suggesting an increase in energetic costs of diving...|$|R

This thesis attempts to implement and adapt this technology for use in the Marine Institute <b>flume</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>flume</b> <b>tank</b> is used for scientific modeling and validation of fishing gear and other objects in ocean environments. This works focuses on the challenges involved in doing this, as well as experimental validation of modern camera calibration and triangulation and adding several novel improvements on these processes. [...] This works shows that a modern system using a properly calibrated system functions faster, more accurately and more precisely than any human driven monitoring system. The testing of the various modern calibration techniques reveals several weaknesses when exposed to the challenging underwater environment. The comparison of several methods for stereo location showed the accuracy of these methods is greatly reduced in challenging environments. Both these results open the way for several novel improvements on the methods which increase accuracy and improve performance over the original methods...|$|E
30|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation was}} conducted to study the hydromechanical constraints of soils in the initiation and development of piping in landslide dams, with emphasis on the potential failure mechanisms of dams composed of various soil materials. Landslide dams were built in a <b>flume</b> <b>tank,</b> and internal erosion within the dams was initiated using an artificial drainage channel composed of uniform pebbles encased in a plastic mesh. Initial condition assumed that the upstream lake was ‘dry’. Thus, the upstream lake was recharged at a steady state flow rate of 1.2 [*]×[*] 10 – 4 m 3 /s.|$|E
40|$|Shell {{orientation}} {{experiments in}} a <b>flume,</b> wave <b>tank,</b> field current, and wave enviromnents have yielded abasic difference between wave and current orientations. Rose diagrams of current orieuted shells show one strong maximum; over {{two thirds of}} an assemblage of elongate conical or plate-form shells point into or away from the current, depending on the geometry and mass distribution of the shell. In shoaling, nonswash waves, long axes of the same forms are aligned parallel to the wave crests or ripple marks. Because of currents associated with wave progression, the maxima tend to be skewed, so that a wave orientation pattern forms an obtuse arrow pointing {{in the direction of}} wave progression. In low angle swash zones, orientations show the two maxima of wave patterns, but the shells are aligned perpendicular to the ripple marks by oncoming and outgoing swash. Equant plate-form shells, rollers, and elongate plates and cones with protuberances may develop typical orientation patterns, but commonly show nondiagnostic orientations. Heavy shells fail to develop diagnostic orientations when they become on{rapped in relatively, soft sediment. Shells may become ntangled on pro-jections on gravel and shell hash, thus developing nondiagnostic orientations. Shells are commonly oriented in a stable position by currents, then buried by scour around the shell margins. Under weak waves, cones are buried in wave orientation by detritus on the bottom. Under ipple-forming waves...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} system put up at SEAFDEC [Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center; Philippines] {{consisted of}} six rectangular (96 x 196 x 42 cm) fiberglass-coated tanks made of marine plywood. It can depurate about 230 to 310 kg bivalves in two days. Initial findings showed that under normal seawater conditions (salinity 29 - 32 ppt, temperature 27 - 30 degrees Celsius; oxygen content 3 - 6. 2 mg/L; and pH 7. 4 - 8. 3) and moderate {{rate of flow}} (7 - 10 L/min), highly contaminated oysters (MPN 1. 0 x 10 to the fifth power to 2. 0 x 10 to the sixth power/ 100 g meat) can be depurated within 48 hr or less. A short <b>flume</b> type of <b>tank</b> with a volume of about 250 L was designed, tested and showed to cleanse oysters under normal conditions in only 24 hr with a flow rate of 7 L/min and with very little resulting mortality. More important, the tank can be lifted and moved by only two men of average body built...|$|R
40|$|MildWAVE (Troch, 1998) is a {{numerical}} mild-slope wave propagation model which {{is able to}} generate linear water waves over a mildly varying bathymetry and to calculate instantaneous surface elevations throughout the domain. Wave transformation processes such as refraction, shoaling, reflection, transmission and diffraction are simulated intrinsically. Characterising the wave climate in coastal regions using regular waves is mostly unsatisfactory. Irregular long crested waves are most often used to represent the real sea state. In reality the sea state is however short crested and the waves propagate in multiple directions. So, short crested wave generation is the best approach to model real waves. Both irregular long and short crested wave generation has been implemented in MildWAVE. In order to validate the numerical wave generation module, tests were run in {{a numerical}} wave <b>flume</b> and wave <b>tank.</b> The use of the so-called energy velocity {{appears to be a}} necessity when using the mild-slope equations. The result of the thesis is a multifunctional numerical model {{that can be used for}} different applications, for example to estimate the risk of flooding in a harbour due to wave penetration and overtopping or to predict the influence of coastal engineering structures on the wave propagation. The possibilities of the new MildWAVE model were demonstrated with an extensive application for the Harbour of Ostend. The present situation and two future designs with breakwaters have been compared for both long and short crested waves and for different storm scenarios...|$|R
