40|$|From the introduction]. It {{is argued}} {{in much of}} the functionalist and neofunctionalist {{literature}} that interest groups can contribute toward integration through encouraging transnational functional cooperation, but there has so far been little investigation of the potential contribution of group activity to integration through its role in the formation of a supranational <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture. This paper uses the example of environmental interest groups to argue that by helping fill the participatory vacuum, group activity may be helping strengthen the foundations of European integration, may be contributing {{to the development of a}} <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture, and may thus be helping define the character, nature, and parameters of the emerging European polity...|$|R

In certain European countries, the four-door JDM Civic is available with the hybrid powertrain, being the only Civic sedan available in the UK. In other markets where sedans are more popular (such as Ireland and Finland), a range of sedans similar to the JDM models are available with the 1.8 L i-VTEC. In Singapore and Brunei, the 3-door <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> Type R was available.|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> (FK/FN chassis) {{is offered}} {{primarily}} as 5-door and 3-door hatchbacks and produced in Swindon, UK. It {{has a different}} appearance and suspension compared to the American and JDM Civics. The car won 2007 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> {{differs from}} the American and JDM {{variants}} in that it uses a simpler torsion beam suspension system for the rear wheels compared to the double-wishbone system in the American and JDM versions. The more compact suspension of the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> allows it to keep its large interior space, while reducing its length compared to its predecessor. Engines include a 1.4-litre i-DSI,1.4-litre i-vtec, the 1.8-litre i-VTEC(R18A2) shared with the American and JDM models (although the American and JDM cars have this engine available as R18A1), and a 2.2-litre i-CTDi N22A2 turbodiesel. A 6-speed manual transmission is available across the range. An automated manual transmission, known as i-SHIFT is available for models with 1.4- and 1.8-litre petrol engines. A 2.0-litre i-VTEC (K20Z4) petrol Type-R high-performance version is also available.|$|R

5000|$|Inside, the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> {{follows the}} same {{split-level}} or [...] "two-tier" [...] instrument panel as the American and JDM <b>Civics.</b> However, the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> has circular A/C vents and switchgear. There {{is also a}} start button reminiscent of the Honda S2000. The handbrake is in a more conventional position behind the gear stick. All around there is a generous use of metallic trim. Some other features of the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> include [...] "magic seats" [...] in the rear, that not only lie flat to increase boot capacity, but also allow the seat bench to lift up and lie flat against the back rests to create a large loading area in the back behind the front seats. There is also a [...] "hidden" [...] storage compartment in the boot under the floor. The lid, which normally forms part of the boot floor, can be sunk down to a lower level to increase the load area, designed to allow the boot area to accommodate larger or taller items. In the normal position, the storage area {{can be used to}} hide valuables away under the floor. Some models in the range feature things like electric folding mirrors, a panoramic glass roof, dual climate control, automatic headlights, xenon lights, headlight washers, and automatic windshield wipers. The range topping EX model also has DVD satellite navigation, and allows the car's entertainment system, climate control, navigation system and hands-free telephone system to be controlled all by voice commands.|$|R

50|$|Honda debuted a Type R {{concept for}} the <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show; the Type R, basing on the three-door {{hatchback}} {{developed for the}} European market, has a 2.0-litre 201 bhp (150 kW) at 7800 rpm inline 4 cylinder engine. The suspension uses MacPherson struts up front and a torsion beam in the back, while the car itself was initially thought to be lighter than the standard Civic as dictated by Honda Type R philosophy. Sophisticated handling aids such as traction control were initially thought to be completely eschewed for a purer, more soulful driving character. In the end, Honda did include a special version of their VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist) that was specifically tuned to the car so as to better adhere to said philosophy. The Type R went on sale in the UK in February or March 2007, and is scheduled to reach Australia in July the same year. The <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> Type R also went on sale in Brunei.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{claims the}} chassis is 50% more rigid than the {{previous}} Japan-only DC5 Integra Type R, and the new model features an independent rear suspension rather than the torsion beam configuration used on the latest <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> Type-R. To save weight, aluminium is used extensively and bonded with adhesive instead of welded. Though the chassis is larger and more rigid than JDM Integra Type R, it is only 1.8 kg heavier.|$|R
50|$|The Malatestiana Library (Biblioteca Malatestiana), {{also known}} as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library dating from 1452 in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna (Italy).

40|$|In Europe, {{during the}} early 20 th century, new civic designs often drew upon images of medieval cities. In order to create the 'city of tomorrow', and define what was 'modern' in new city design, the medieval city {{frequently}} became characterized and depicted as 'natural' and 'irregular' in its development and form. This {{can be seen in}} the writing of particular urbanists, planners, and designers working on <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> designs in the period between 1890 and 1950. I examine the writing of Camillo Sitte, Le Corbusier, and Thomas Sharp to chart how they, as well as some of their contemporaries, called upon particular visions of the medieval city to develop and mobilize their own competing conceptions of modern urbanism. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{constitution}} of an <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> awareness, can be clearly {{read from the}} collapse of the Soviet bloc and in conjunction with the events that have marked the end of Yugoslavia and the next {{constitution of}} multi-ethnic states in the Balkan area. It's nonetheless true that in recent years, it is increasingly consolidating the idea of Citizenship Education through elements of communication and access to training opportunities, which also affects the post-socialist countries in preaccession. The existence of formal and non-formal (EFA) educational activities focused on themes like Education for Active Citizenship (EAC), {{is one of the most}} important issues to contribute to the consolidation of multicultural democracies. But, the construction of educational infrastructure, necessary for this purpose, as in the case of the Republic of Macedonia, was confronted with several topics.

40|$|Since the Treaty of Maastricht (1992) all {{nationals}} of EU {{member states}} hold EU citizenship too. EU citizens hold EU citizenship rights {{in addition to}} their national rights. These rights include civil, social, economic and political rights. Holding these rights does not guarantee actual participation: there are, for instance, increasingly concerns about (too) low voter turnout and a (too) low number of citizens participating in other activities related to political decision making. Therefore, {{there seems to be a}} quest for a <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture. Citizenship education, and more specifically European citizenship education, is seen as an important instrument to stimulate the development of a <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture. This study shows that (governmental) policies and practices of citizenship education differ widely between the seven examined countries (the Netherlands, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Hungary). Citizenship education practices are, for instance, deeply related to the type of the democratic development, type of the democratic regime and social issues within the polity. Furthermore, the education practices show great variety of available teaching modules both in formal and informal way. There also seems to be a certain paradox between acknowledging the importance that civic education has for society, and political readiness to acknowledge that specific training is needed for teachers to be eligible to qualitatively educate and prepare students for their roles as active citizens. However, all countries share a very similar approach regarding to the European dimension of citizenship: it is a highly neglected area within the national curriculum. The focus is dominantly on the factual and theoretical knowledge on the EU and especially its institutions rather than the promotion of values and the training of skills needed to exercise EU citizenship rights and needed for development of active, participating EU citizens. Hence, European citizenship education within the member states seems to be in its infancy. To develop a <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> culture, socialization and developing civic competencies are important. Therefore, it is important to strengthen and further develop European citizenship education. European citizenship teaching packages may help policymakers and teachers at the national level with these developments. Moreover, considering the existing underdeveloped conceptualization and focus on EU dimension of citizenship in all studied cases, the introduction of (more) EU citizenship education has to be aware of at least two challenges. The first one stems from the generally dominant notion of elitist type of democracy of EU level, which is perceived to be dominated by the bureaucracy and disconnected to daily needs and practices of EU citizens. The role of EU citizenship education has to raise awareness on existence of interdependence of the decisions made on the EU level to the political consequences for national policies a practices of citizenship. The full emancipation of citizens can hardly be established even at the national level, if they are excluded from active participation at the decision making processes on the supranational level. The second challenge relates to the identity dimension of EU citizenship. There can hardly be EU without some sort of shared solidarity among its citizens. Citizenship education may not be a sufficient tool for achieving this goal, but it certainly is one of the most appropriate ones’ on the disposition of the member states...|$|R

50|$|The five door {{hatchback}} <b>Civic</b> for <b>European</b> {{market was}} unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011. Strong {{identity of the}} previous generation <b>European</b> <b>Civic</b> led Honda to refine the current package instead of radical changes.

It is {{claimed to be the}} most aerodynamic car in its class, with a coefficient of 0.27. The wheelbase is 30mm shorter without a decrease of interior space. Retaining the compact torsion beam rear suspension and the centrally mounted fuel tank help contribute to a boot capacity of 470 litres. More than 20,000 miles of testing was carried out on British roads for better handling and ride quality. The rear beam axle is completely redesigned for higher stiffness, and new fluid-filled bushing is used to improve stability and cornering ability, as well as ride quality.

30|$|Scholars {{studying}} the West <b>European</b> <b>civic</b> integrationist turn only rarely extend their analyses to include school policies. Instead, they have mainly {{focused on the}} increasing use of formalized language, knowledge, and employment requirements for permanent residence and citizenship since the late 1990 s (Goodman, 2014; Joppke, 2007). Yet, increasing cultural diversity in schools has also created a push, especially from the EU, to reconsider whether current practices of citizenship education produce good liberal-democratic citizens (Faas, Hajisoteriou, & Angelides, 2014). This increased focus on bridging ethno-cultural diversity and conveying societal values and knowledge to coming generations of citizens could be viewed {{as part of a broader}} civic integrationist turn. West European politics has generally demonstrated an intensified concern with producing and re-producing a national citizenry with the skills and virtues required to sustain a well-functioning liberal democracy and social welfare state (cf. Mouritsen, 2008). This may involve a wide range of policies, from strict and carefully crafted entry requirements for newcomers to softer forms of value and knowledge transmittance to pupils in schools.|$|R

By means of implementing the principle of the sovereignty of nations, those eligible to vote are able to express their will through the institutions of direct democracy and representative democracy. The instruments of direct democracy are an extremely interesting research subject – not only due to the fact that the number of votes on European integration has been very high (especially in the last decade), but also because EU Member States, being aware of the importance of citizen involvement in the process of integration in Europe, established the institution of the European citizens’ initiative. Using this instrument, European citizens can impact the politics of the EU. The purpose of this text is to answer the question of the role of direct democracy and its tools in the process of European integration, as well as of the prospects for the use of direct forms of governance in the process of deepening and widening integration in Europe...|$|R
