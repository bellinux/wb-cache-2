While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional <b>gray</b> <b>shading.</b> Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
500|$|Physcia caesia is {{a species}} of foliose lichenized fungus. First {{described}} by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1784, it is common across much of Europe, North America and New Zealand, and more patchily distributed in South America, Asia, Australia and Antarctica. There are 2 subspecies, P. c. caesia and P. c. ventosa, {{as well as a}} number of distinct forms and varieties. Molecular studies suggest that the species as currently defined may be polyphyletic. It is typically pale <b>gray</b> <b>shading</b> to darker gray in the center (though some forms are considerably darker), and grows in a small rosette, usually some [...] across at maturity. It only rarely has apothecia, instead reproducing most often vegetatively via soredia, which are piled in round blue-gray mounds across the thallus's upper surface. It grows most often on rock—principally calcareous, but also basaltic and siliceous—and also occurs on bone, bark and soil. It is nitrophilic and is particularly common on substrates where birds perch.|$|E

40|$|An {{addressing}} {{technique that}} is based on modified discrete cosine transform (M-DCT) is proposed to drive RMS responding matrix displays. Time taken to switch from one arbitrary <b>gray</b> <b>shade</b> to another is almost independent of initial and final <b>gray</b> <b>shades.</b> 1. Objective and Background Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is capable of achieving a high energy compaction ratio and it is extensively used in image compression. We have explored the possibility of using DCT to drive RMS responding matrix displays. There are several addressing techniques for displaying <b>gray</b> <b>shades</b> in passive matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Amplitude modulation [1], pulse height modulation [2], successive approximation techniques [3, 4] and wavelets based techniques [5 - 7] are some of the techniques {{that can be used to}} display <b>gray</b> <b>shades.</b> Grayscale to grayscale response times i. e. the time taken to switch from one arbitrary <b>gray</b> <b>shade</b> to another depends on the initial and final <b>gray</b> <b>shades</b> in these techniques. It is preferable to have uniform switching times between gray scales to preserve color purity of images and avoid motion artifacts. Almost uniform response times are achieved when pixels are switched from one arbitrary <b>gray</b> <b>shade</b> to another if the display is scanned with DCT based addressing technique that is proposed in this paper. 2. Discrete Cosine Transform Discrete cosine transform is a subset of discrete Fourier transform. A function is expressed as a sum of cosine functions of several frequencies in discrete cosine transform (DCT) as compared to expressing it with sine and cosine functions in discrete Fourier transform (DFT). A DCT of a signal s(n) is obtained as follows: CT (k) N 1 ⎛ π (2...|$|R
