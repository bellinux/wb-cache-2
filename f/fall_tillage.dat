Information is lacking on seasonal CO 2 efflux patterns, as affected by degree of soil disturbance/residue mixing and time of tillage operations. An experiment was conducted following a grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor] (L.)

Measures were also taken in the spring after imposing tillage treatments on another set of plots. Concurrent measures were also made on undisturbed plots. For fall measurements, increased CO 2 efflux was related to degree of soil disturbance.

With spring tillage, CO 2 losses for the undisturbed and disk treatment were similar, while the chisel treatment exhibited a slightly lower loss.

In the spring, half of the 30 -in plots were in-row subsoiled and half of the 7. 5 -in plots were paratilled, and these were compared to no spring deep tillage. Soybeans were planted in early June in 1994 and 1995.

The objectives {{of this research}} were to: test populations of Italian ryegrass from across Arkansas for resistance to glyphosate, diclofop, pinoxaden, and pyroxsulam; determine {{if there were any}} differences in control of 12 glyphosate-resistant populations in relation to glyphosate rate or application timing; determine the level of glyphosate resistance in one selected population versus a susceptible standard and a previously discovered glyphosate-resistant population; and determine the best options for controlling Italian ryegrass prior to planting crops. A total of 215 population samples were tested. On average 17 % of the samples were resistant to glyphosate, 95 % were resistant to diclofop, 64 % were resistant to pyroxsulam, and 12 % were resistant to pinoxaden. A few were resistant to all four chemistries tested. Control of glyphosate-resistant populations was improved with the high rate of glyphosate at the three- to four-tiller growth stage; however, results for individual populations were variable. When averaged across populations, no rate or timing of glyphosate controlled these resistant populations greater than 62 %. One population was found to be 23 times more tolerant to glyphosate than a susceptible standard. Three field experiments were conducted for Italian ryegrass control in the spring, in no-till production in the fall, and following <b>fall</b> <b>tillage.</b> Herbicide applications in the spring were unsuccessful, especially when glyphosate is not an option.

40|$|A {{three year}} field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the role of soil inversion, cover crops and spring tillage methods for Palmer amaranth between-row (BR) and within-row (WR) management in glufosinate-resistant cotton. Main plots were two soil inversion treatments: <b>fall</b> inversion <b>tillage</b> (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NIT). Subplots were three cover treatments: crimson clover, cereal rye or none (i. e., winter fallow); and the sub subplots were four secondary spring tillage methods: disking followed by (fb) cultivator (DCU), disking fb chisel plow (DCH), disking fb disking (DD) and no tillage (NT). Averaged over years and soil inversion, the crimson clover produced maximum cover biomass (4390 kg ha&# 8722; 1) fb cereal rye (3698 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and winter fallow (777 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Two weeks after planting (WAP) and before the postemergence (POST) application, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were two- and four-times less, respectively, in IT than NIT. Further, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were reduced two-fold following crimson clover and cereal rye than following winter fallow at 2 WAP. Without IT, early season Palmer amaranth densities were 40 % less following DCU, DCH and DD, when compared with IT. Following IT, no spring tillage method improved Palmer amaranth control. The timely application of glufosinate + S-metolachlor POST tank mixture greatly improved Palmer amaranth control in both IT and NIT systems. The highest cotton yields were obtained with DD following cereal rye (2251 kg ha&# 8722; 1), DD following crimson clover (2213 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and DD following winter fallow (2153 kg ha&# 8722; 1). On average, IT cotton yields (2133 kg ha&# 8722; 1) were 21 % higher than NIT (1766 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Therefore, from an integrated weed management standpoint, an occasional fall IT could greatly reduce Palmer amaranth emergence on farms highly infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth. In addition, a cereal rye or crimson clover cover crop can effectively reduce early season Palmer amaranth emergence in both IT and NIT systems. For effective and season-long control of Palmer amaranth, one or more POST applications of glufosinate + residual herbicide as tank mixture may be needed in a glufosinate-based cotton production system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} impacts of corn stover harvest in Central Iowa with regards to {{nutrient}} removal, grain yield impacts and soil tilth. Focusing on phosphorus and potassium removal due to production of large, square bales of corn stover, 3. 7 lb P 2 O 5 and 18. 7 lb K 2 O per dry ton of corn stover were removed in 2011. P 2 O 5 removal remained statistically the same in 2012, but K 2 O decreased to 15. 1 lb per ton of dry corn stover. Grain cart data showed no statistical difference in grain yield between harvest treatments, but grain yield monitor data showed a 3 – 17 bu/ac increase in 2012 and hand samples showed a 4 – 21 bu/ac increase in 2013. Corn stover residue levels decreased below 30 % coverage when corn stover was harvested the previous <b>fall</b> and conventional <b>tillage</b> methods were used, but incorporating reduced tillage practices following corn stover harvest increased residue levels back up to 30 % coverage. Corn emergence rates increased by at least 2, 470 more plants per acre within {{the first three days}} of spiking, but final populations between harvest and nonharvest corn stover treatments were the same. Inorganic soil nitrogen in the form of ammonium and nitrate were not directly impacted by corn stover harvest, but it is hypothesized that weather patterns had a greater impact on nitrogen availability. Lastly, soil organic matter did not statistically change from 2011 to 2013 due to corn stover removal, even when analyzed withing single soil types...|$|R

Previous surveys have identified fields with low organic matter contents and shallow compacted zones in the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production region of central Alabama, USA. We initiated a field experiment in 2003 on a Lucedale fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Paleudult) to determine how conservation tillage systems and winter cover crops affect yields and moisture availability. Treatments were a factorial combination of tillage systems (no <b>tillage,</b> <b>fall</b> paratill, spring paratill, and spring strip tillage) and winter cover crops [no cover, rye (Secale cereale L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ] in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Soil moisture was monitored continuously {{during the growing season}} to a depth of 30 cm. In 2004, results indicate that tillage had no effect on lint yields, while rye and wheat increased lint yields 12 and 5 % compared to no cover. Soil moisture contents were generally 5 % higher than soil moisture contents measured from no cover plots. In 2005, some form of non-inversion tillage was superior to no-tillage. Lint yields across cover crops averaged 1512 kg ha- 1 for wheat, 1444 kg ha- 1 for rye, and 1299 kg ha- 1 for no cover. Trends in soil moisture contents across tillage systems and covers were similar to 2004, but not as dramatic. These results indicate that a high residue cover crop is required on degraded soils of central Alabama to maximize lint yields and soil moisture...|$|R
