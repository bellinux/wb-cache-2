50|$|The word hypnagogia {{entered the}} popular {{psychology}} literature through Dr. Andreas Mavromatis in his 1983 thesis, while hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> were coined by {{others in the}} 1800s and noted by Havelock Ellis. The term hypnagogic was originally coined by Alfred Maury to name the state of consciousness during the onset of sleep. <b>Hypnopompic</b> was coined by Frederic Myers soon afterwards to denote the onset of wakefulness. The term hypnagogia is used by Dr. Mavromatis to identify {{the study of the}} sleep-transitional consciousness states in general, and he employs hypnogogic (toward sleep) or hypnapompic (from sleep) for the purpose of identifying the specific experiences under study.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>hypnopompic</b> state (or hypnopomp) is {{the state}} of {{consciousness}} leading out of sleep, a term coined by the psychical researcher Frederic Myers. Its mirror is the hypnagogic state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is rational waking cognition {{trying to make sense of}} non-linear images and associations; the <b>hypnopompic</b> state is emotional and credulous dreaming cognition trying to make sense of real world [...] They have a different phenomenological character. Depressed frontal lobe function in the first few minutes after waking - known as [...] "sleep inertia" [...] - causes slowed reaction time and impaired short-term memory. Sleepers often wake confused, or speak without making sense, a phenomenon the psychologist Peter McKeller calls [...] "hypnopompic speech". When the awakening occurs out of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, in which most dreams occur, the <b>hypnopompic</b> state is sometimes accompanied by lingering vivid imagery. Some of the creative insights attributed to dreams actually happen in this moment of awakening from REM. In Deirdre Barrett's The Committee of Sleep, Margie Profet's McArthur-award winning biology experiment is shown to be one of these.|$|E

50|$|In 1906 Kraepelin, {{a pioneer}} of the somatic {{approach}} to psychiatry and of the methodical classification of psychiatric disorders, published a 105-page monograph Über Sprachstörungen im Traume (On Speech Disorders in Dreams). As the title suggests, Kraepelin's declared aim was to analyze only deviant specimens of speech from dreams. Specimens reflecting correct speech processes were excluded from his study. To this end, Kraepelin assembled {{in the course of}} twenty years 286 specimens, the vast majority drawn from his own dreams, with no pretense to nonselectivity. He apparently drew in large measure from hypnagogic and occasionally <b>hypnopompic</b> dreamlets (experienced when falling asleep and waking up), which differ phenomologically from full-fledged dreams and are characterized by different neurological indices as well.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mental image}} or mental picture is the {{representation}} in a person's {{mind of the}} physical world outside of that person.

[...] There are sometimes episodes, particularly on falling asleep (hypnagogic imagery) and waking up (<b>hypnopompic),</b> when the mental imagery, being of a rapid, phantasmagoric and involuntary character, defies perception, presenting a kaleidoscopic field, in which no distinct object can be discerned.

5000|$|Sleep paralysis, for example, {{can produce}} {{the feeling that}} one is paralyzed or has {{difficulty}} moving. It can also produce the effect of floating or the sense of an out-of-body experience. Sleep paralysis occurs in a transition time and the person is in a dream-like state, hallucinations can occur just before falling asleep (hynogogic hallucination) or just after (<b>hypnopompic</b> hallucination). These hallucinations feel real to the person experiencing sleep paralysis and can often be accompanied by sensory features: musty smells, shuffling sounds, visions of ghosts, aliens, and monsters. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger of Laurentian University in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, believes that these sensations can spontaneously occur in some people, given the right set of circumstances, leading {{to the kind of}} feelings of [...] "tremendous meaningfulness and fear" [...] sometimes expressed by alleged alien abductees.|$|E

5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of abduction experiences are thought to originate from an episode of sleep paralysis, which is often accompanied by a feeling of a heavy weight pressing down upon one's chest, as well as <b>hypnopompic</b> hallucinations—the feeling of flying or levitating, flashing lights, feeling a presence in one's bedroom, and hallucinations of figures (such as a person or an animal) near one's bed. The content of these hallucinations tends to be strongly influenced by the individual's cultural beliefs. Before the 20th century, such hallucinations were interpreted as attacks by incubus and succubus demons, whereas in Newfoundland a witch-like creature is commonly hallucinated. In The Demon-Haunted World, Carl Sagan said the alien abduction experience is similar to tales of demon abduction common throughout history. According to Sagan:There is no spaceship in these stories. But most of the central elements of the alien abduction account are present, including sexually obsessive non-humans {{who live in the}} sky, walk through walls, communicate telepathically, and perform breeding experiments on the human species. Unless we believe that demons really exist, how can we understand so strange a belief system, embraced by the whole Western world ... reinforced by personal experience in every generation, and taught by Church and State? Is there any real alternative besides a shared delusion based on common brain wiring and chemistry?".|$|E
50|$|In 1919 {{the family}} moved to Rome, where they kept a luxurious {{household}} in the Villa Caetani on the Gianicolo and received many guests, such as the German painter Leo von König (1871-1944) who became Wolfgang's first art teacher. It was in Rome, under the guidance of his father´s friend, the archeologist Ludwig Pollak, that he became an expert in Greek and Roman archaeology. In 1923 he returned to Berlin alone to apply for the Academy. Although unsuccessful, he met his lifelong friend, companion and patron, the Swiss violinist and photographer Eva Sulzer (Winterthur 1902 - 1990 Mexico City). In 1925 he exhibited at the Berlin Secession and studied further in aesthetics, deeply influenced by Julius Meier-Graefe, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and the Gestalt theory of Max Wertheimer. It is here and with <b>hypnopompic</b> hallucinations in the castle in Sagan that he found the base for his later ideas of a deep entanglement of vision and outer world. After another year of studies, in Paris and Cassis (1925-26), where he met Roland Penrose, Jean Varda (Janco) and Georges Braque, he visited the art school of Hans Hofmann in Munich and, in 1928, Saint-Tropez. He then decided to settle in Paris. The year 1928 marks also the beginning of the decline of the family´s splendour, once founded on the patriarchal rules of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. After a homoerotic affair with a mental healer, his younger brother Hans-Peter died unexpectedly in a Berlin insane asylum, presumably of suicide; the parents consequently separated; their mother´s bipolar disposition intensified as a result; the fortune of Gustav Paalen is quashed after the Black Tuesday, 1929. A later tragedy, crucial to Paalen's development, was his beloved brother Rainer's shooting himself in head with a pistol. Wolfgang witnessed the event, although Rainer survived, following treatment in a Berlin hospital and escaped from the city in 1933. He died in a mental hospital in Czechoslovakia in 1942.|$|E
40|$|Hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> {{hallucinations}} are visual, tactile, auditory {{or other}} sensory events, usually brief but sometimes prolonged, that {{occur at the}} transition from wakefulness to sleep (hypnagogic) or from sleep to wakefulness (<b>hypnopompic).</b> Hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> hallucinations are often associated with sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis occurs immediately prior to falling asleep (hypnagogic paralysis) or upon waking (<b>hypnopompic</b> paralysis).

The present paper reports {{on the development of the}} Durham Hypnagogic and <b>Hypnopompic</b> Hallucinations Questionnaire (DHQ), which consists of three unidimensional subscales assessing the presence of auditory, visual, and felt-presence experiences in the H&H state. In a sample of 18 - 29 year olds (N = 365) this scale was found to have satisfactory psychometric properties. A subsample (n = 293) completed self-report measures of intrusive thoughts, thought suppression and transliminality. Intrusive thoughts and the conscious desire to undertake thought suppression both correlated with levels of auditory, but not visual or felt-presence H&H hallucinations.

40|$|Introduction: Narcolepsy is {{a chronic}} disease {{characterized}} by sleep attacks, {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} and nocturnal sleep fragmentation.

Discussion/conclusion: Patients with narcolepsy face several problems due to the disease which, if left untreated or ineffectively treated, cause embarrassing or distressing symptoms, affecting their quality of life.

In the collection, domestic spaces, particularly kitchens, serve as filters and lenses through which to process anxiety and pain. Conversely, domestic spaces are viewed as areas of both liberation and confinement and the voices of the various speakers throughout the manuscript struggle with this duality/plurality and whether there is a choice to participate in the intergenerational recycling and handing down of these beliefs and behaviors or not.

40|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} (SP) {{refers to}} a brief pre- or postdormital paralysis often, but not always, accompanied by vivid sensory and perceptual experiences, including complex hallucinations (called hypnagogic hallucinations when occurring predormit-ally and <b>hypnopompic</b> when occurring postdormitally) and, almost invariably, intense fear (International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2005). To our knowledge, there is no evi-dence that SP episodes indicate or presage psychoses, although cases exist where hallucinations accompanying SP have led to misdiagnosis of psychosis (Douglass, 2003; Powell & Nielsen, 1998; Shapiro & Spitz, 1976). Although SP has long been associated with narcolepsy {{as a component of}} the “narcoleptic tetrad, ” its occurrence as an isolated condition unrelated to other symptoms of narcolepsy is at least an order of magnitude greater than the incidence of narcolepsy (Cheyne, 2006). Despite the general paralysis during SP episodes, there is sparing of eye movements and continued automatic breathing, though the inability to breathe voluntarily may produce feel-ings of pressure on the chest and suffocation. SP can range from a once-in-a-lifetime experience to a recurring phenome-non consisting of frequent episodes occurring in bouts with nightly or multiple nightly episodes. Substantial variance in reports of SP prevalence estimates (5 %– 60 %) likely reflects, in part, differences in survey methods, operational definitions, age and other demographic characteristics of survey partici-pants, and cultural factors (Cheyne, Newby-Clark, & Rueffer...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) {{occurring in}} hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> (H&H) states has received little attention. In {{a sample of}} healthy participants (N = 325), 108 participants reported H&H AVHs and answered subsequent questions on their phenomenology. AVHs in the H&H state were found (1) to {{be more likely to}} only feature the occasional clear word than to be clear, (2) to be more likely to be one-off voices than to be recurrent voices, (3) to be more likely to be voices of people known to the individual than unknown persons, (4) to be more likely to talk directly to the person rather than not, and (5) to only rarely give commands, ask questions, or to result in an interactive conversation. Their phenomenology was similar to normative AVHs in wakefulness (as established by previous research) in that the voice-hearer was usually the target of the voice, and the voice was more likely to be of a recognized person. However, H&H AVHs differed from AVHs in wakefulness in that commands and questions were rare, and there was typically no dialogical engagement with the voice.

40|$|Aim: Hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> {{hallucinations}} {{are characteristic}} symptoms of narcolepsy, as are excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy patients may also experience daytime hallucinations unrelated to sleep-wake transitions. The effect of medication on hallucinations {{is of interest}} since treatment of narcolepsy may provoke psychotic symptoms. We aim to analyze the relation between sodium oxybate (SXB) treatment and psychotic symptoms in narcolepsy patients. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of hallucinations to determine their nature as mainly psychotic or hypnagogic and raise a discussion about whether SXB causes psychosis or if psychosis occurs as an endogenous complication in narcolepsy. Method: We present altogether four patients with narcolepsy who experienced psychotic symptoms during treatment with SXB. In addition, we searched the literature for descriptions of hallucinations in narcolepsy and similarities and differences with psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Results: Three out of four patients had hallucinations typical for psychosis and one had symptoms that resembled aggravated hypnagogic hallucinations. Two patients also had delusional symptoms primarily associated with mental disorders. Tapering down SXB was tried and helped in two out of four cases. Adding antipsychotic treatment (risperidone) alleviated psychotic symptoms in two cases. Conclusion: Psychotic symptoms in narcolepsy may appear during SXB treatment. Hallucinations resemble those seen in schizophrenia however the insight that symptoms are delusional is usually preserved. In case of SXB-induced psychotic symptoms or hallucinations, reducing SXB dose or adding antipsychotic medication can be tried...|$|E
40|$|By definition, {{hallucinations}} {{occur only}} in the full waking state. Yet similarities to sleep-related experiences such as hypnagogic and <b>hypnopompic</b> hallucinations, dreams and parasomnias, have been noted since antiquity. These observations have prompted researchers to suggest a common aetiology for these phenomena based on the neurobiology of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. With our recent understanding of hallucinations in different population groups and at the neurobiological, cognitive and interpersonal levels, {{it is now possible}} to draw comparisons between the 2 sets of experiences as never before. In the current article, we make detailed comparisons between sleep-related experiences and hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eye disease, at the levels of phenomenology (content, sensory modalities involved, perceptual attributes) and of brain function (brain activations, resting-state networks, neurotransmitter action). Findings show that sleep-related experiences share considerable overlap with hallucinations at the level of subjective descriptions and underlying brain mechanisms. Key differences remain however: (1) Sleep-related perceptions are immersive and largely cut off from reality, whereas hallucinations are discrete and overlaid on veridical perceptions; and (2) Sleep-related perceptions involve only a subset of neural networks implicated in hallucinations, reflecting perceptual signals processed in a functionally and cognitively closed-loop circuit. In summary, both phenomena are non-veridical perceptions that share some phenomenological and neural similarities, but insufficient evidence exists to fully support the notion that the majority of hallucinations depend on REM processes or REM intrusions into waking consciousness...|$|E

Confusional arousals were reported by 2. 9 % of the sample: 1 % (95 % confidence interval:. 8 to 1. 2 %) of the sample also presented with memory deficits (53. 9 %), disorientation in time and/or space (71 %), or slow mentation and speech (54. 4 %), and 1. 9 % (1. 7 % to 2. 1 %) reported confusional arousals without associated features. Younger subjects (< 35 years) and shift or night workers were at higher risk of reporting confusional arousals.

40|$|Narcolepsy is {{a unique}} model for {{dysfunction}} in mechanisms that regulate sleep and wakefulness. the narcolepsy syndrome is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness with recurrent episodes of irresistible sleep, cataplexy, hypnagogic and/or <b>hypnopompic</b> hallucinations and sleep paralysis. the current hypothesis for the etiology of narcolepsy {{is that it is}} an autoimmune disorder because of its strong association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. HLA-DQ alleles are not particularly mutated in narcoleptic patients but they directly influence susceptibility to the disease. DQB 1 (*) 0602 homozygote carriers have a two to four times higher risk of developing the disease than heterozygote carriers. in the present study we report a rare multiplex familial case of narcolepsy-cataplexy and show the strong effect of the HLA-DQB 1 (*) 0602 allele upon the disease phenotype. in the family studied herein, both the proband and his brother are severely affected and homozygous DQB 1 * 0602, whereas their sister does not carry the allele and is not affected at all. These data corroborate previous findings proposing DQB 1 * 0602 homozygous subjects to be far more susceptible to narcolepsy. Insights into the DQB 1 * 0602 positive family that include homozygous subjects may prove to be an important asset in the investigation of genetic vs. environmental factors predisposing to narcolepsy.

The intervention includes four steps: (1) reappraisal of the meaning of the attack; (2) psychological and emotional distancing; (3) inward focused-attention meditation; (4) muscle relaxation. The intervention promotes attentional shift away from unpleasant external and internal stimuli (i. e., terrifying hallucinations and bodily paralysis sensations) unto an emotionally pleasant internal object (e. g., a positive memory). It may facilitate a relaxed meditate state characterized by a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic dominance, associated with greater levels of alpha activity (which may lead to drowsiness and potentially sleep). The procedure may also reduce the initial panic and arousal that occur when realizing one is paralyzed. In addition, I present a novel Panic-Hallucination (PH) Model of Sleep Paralysis; describing how through escalating cycles of fear and panic-like autonomic arousal a positive feedback loop is created that worsens the attack (e. g., leading to longer and more fearful episodes), drives content of hallucinations, and causes future episodes of SP. Case examples are presented to illustrate the feasibility of MR therapy for SP...|$|E
