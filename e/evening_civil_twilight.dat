50|$|On 22 June 2010, a late-running Pacific Blue {{flight to}} Sydney {{took off from}} Queenstown. At the time, the airport had no runway lights, and the airline {{mandated}} a departure curfew of 30 minutes before <b>evening</b> <b>civil</b> <b>twilight,</b> allowing enough time for the aircraft {{to return to the}} airport in case of an emergency. The Boeing 737-800 took off on a departure requiring a visual segment, after curfew, and in poor weather. Passengers described a distressing takeoff procedure, with the aircraft flying very low above Lake Wakatipu and the surrounding mountain terrain. The take-off was deemed an endangerment to the safety of the 70 passengers and crew aboard by the Civil Aviation Authority. Both pilots were suspended over the incident, and in April 2011, the flight's captain was charged under the Civil Aviation Act with unnecessary endangerment. This charge was later reduced to one of a careless use of an aircraft, with a maximum fine of NZ$7,000. In March 2013, the pilot, Roderick Gunn, was found guilty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Observational data {{collected}} {{in the field and}} in enclosures show that diurnal, burrow-dwelling European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus) never were above ground during twilight at dawn or at dusk.

Daily patterns of light perceived by these burrowing mammals were measured with light-sensitive radio collar transmitters in an enclosure (the Netherlands) and in the field (Hungary). The observational data are corroborated by the telemetry data, which show clear daily patterns of timing of light perception including light perceived from the burrow entrances. The first light was observed by the animals on average 3. 54 h (enclosure, SD = 0. 45) and 3. 60 h (field, SD = 0. 31) after <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> at dawn, whereas the final observed light was on average 3. 04 h (enclosure, SD = 0. 64) and 2. 02 h (field, SD = 0. 72) before <b>civil</b> <b>twilight</b> at dusk.
