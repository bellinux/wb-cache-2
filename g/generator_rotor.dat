50|$|As {{with all}} {{rotating}} electrical machines, high rotation speeds and small clearances are utilised to maximise flux variations.

Drive for the alternator is normally provided by a standard induction motor for convention and simplicity. Both vertical and horizontal configurations are utilised and in most cases the motor rotor and <b>generator</b> <b>rotor</b> are mounted on a common shaft with no coupling.

50|$|The {{electrical}} energy {{is generated by}} a pair of 500 MW hydrogen-cooled turbo generators. These are located in the 600 m-long machine hall, adjacent to the reactor building. The turbines—the venerable five-cylinder K-500-65/3000—are supplied by the Kharkiv turbine plant; the electrical generators are the TBB-500. The turbine and the <b>generator</b> <b>rotors</b> are mounted on the same shaft; the combined weight of the rotors is almost 200 t and their speed is 3000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Eventually it {{was found}} to be more {{efficient}} to wrap a single loop of wire across the exterior of the ring and simply not have any part of the loop pass through the interior. This also reduces construction complexity since one large winding spanning the width of the ring is able {{to take the place of}} two smaller windings on opposite sides of the ring. All modern armatures use this externally wrapped (drum) design, although the windings do not extend fully across the diameter; they are more akin to chords of a circle, in geometrical terms. Neighboring windings overlap, as can be seen in almost any modern motor or <b>generator</b> <b>rotor</b> that has a commutator. In addition, windings are placed into slots with a rounded shape (as seen from the end of the rotor). At the surface of the rotor, the slots are only as wide as needed to permit the insulated wire to pass through them while winding the coils.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{majority}} of designs the rotating assembly {{in the center of}} the generator—the [...] "rotor"—contains the magnet, and the [...] "stator" [...] is the stationary armature that is electrically connected to a load. As shown in the diagram, the perpendicular component of the stator field affects the torque while the parallel component affects the voltage. The load supplied by the generator determines the voltage. If the load is inductive, then the angle between the rotor and stator fields will be greater than 90 degrees which corresponds to an increased generator voltage. This is known as an overexcited generator. The opposite is true for a generator supplying a capacitive load which is known as an underexcited generator. A set of three conductors make up the armature winding in standard utility equipment, constituting three phases of a power circuit—that correspond to the three wires we are accustomed to see on transmission lines. The phases are wound such that they are 120 degrees apart spatially on the stator, providing for a uniform force or torque on the <b>generator</b> <b>rotor.</b> The uniformity of the torque arises because the magnetic fields resulting from the induced currents in the three conductors of the armature winding combine spatially in such a way as to resemble the magnetic field of a single, rotating magnet. This stator magnetic field or [...] "stator field" [...] appears as a steady rotating field and spins at the same frequency as the rotor when the rotor contains a single dipole magnetic field. The two fields move in [...] "synchronicity" [...] and maintain a fixed position relative to each other as they spin.|$|E
30|$|DFIG {{is a type}} of {{wind power}} {{generator}} which is very popular. In a DFIG, a slow wind turbine rotor is connected to a rapid <b>generator</b> <b>rotor.</b> The generator stator connects with the grid directly while the <b>generator</b> <b>rotor</b> connects with the grid through a group of back-to-back AC/DC/AC converters. The grid-side converter exchanges the power bi-directionally by a smoothing reactor and transformer to maintain the capacitor voltage on the DC bus.

We investigate the suitability of symplectic integrators for power systems. Numerical results show that symplectic integrators compute solutions to the swing equations ten times faster than the conventional trapezoid method. Symplectic integrators were also found to be globally stable preserving several invariants of the Hamiltonian, thereby, providing better transient stability for power systems. Based on the numerical experiments in this paper, there is ample support for the application of symplectic integrators to power systems...|$|R
40|$|Power system {{oscillations}} occur due to {{the lack}} of damping torque at the <b>generators</b> <b>rotors.</b> The oscillation of the <b>generators</b> <b>rotors</b> cause the oscillation of other power system variables such as bus voltage, bus frequency and transmission lines active and reactive power. Power system oscillations are usually in the range between 0. 1 to 2 Hz depending on the number of generators involved in. They can be local or interarea oscillations. However, this project will focus on interarea oscillations only with the frequency range between 0. 1 until 0. 9 Hz. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) got in the recent years a well-known term for higher controllability in power systems by means of power electronic devices. Several FACTS devices have been introduced for various applications worldwide. One of them is Static Var Compensator (SVC), which is a shunt device, provides dynamically variable shunt impedance to regulate the voltage at a bus where it is connected. Simulation of the case studies using SVC to show damping oscillations in the power system were done in Power System Analysis Toolbox. Moreover, location of SVC plays an important part to give effectively damped the oscillations. This project will discuss residue method to find the best placement of SVC for the case studies. Besides, the supplementary controller of SVC can be applied to improve the performance of damping oscillations in the power system. In this project, the supplementary controller for SVC is referred as proportional plus integral plus derivative controller. Lastly, a designing of SVC and supplementary controller to improve 10 % of damping oscillations in the power systems is successfully designed...|$|R

50|$|The doubly-fed <b>generator</b> <b>rotors</b> are {{typically}} wound with 2 to 3 {{times the number}} of turns of the stator. This means that the rotor voltages will be higher and currents respectively lower. Thus in the typical ± 30% operational speed range around the synchronous speed, the rated current of the converter is accordingly lower which leads to a lower cost of the converter. The drawback is that controlled operation outside the operational speed range is impossible because of the higher than rated rotor voltage. Further, the voltage transients due to the grid disturbances (three- and two-phase voltage dips, especially) will also be magnified. In order to prevent high rotor voltages - and high currents resulting from these voltages - from destroying the IGBTs and diodes of the converter, a protection circuit (called crowbar) is used.|$|R
