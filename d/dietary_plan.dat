Following this <b>dietary</b> <b>plan</b> for 21 days has been demonstrated to improve blood pressure, LDL-C, and certain markers of oxidative stress, {{but it has also}} been shown to lower HDL-C. Krill oil supplementation has been shown to increase HDL-C. Methods We investigated the effects of following a Daniel Fast <b>dietary</b> <b>plan</b> with either krill oil supplementation (2 g/day) or placebo supplementation (coconut oil; 2 g/day) for 21 days. The subjects in this study (12 men and 27 women) were heterogeneous with respect to body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight, and obese), blood lipids (normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic), blood glucose (normal fasting glucose, impaired fasting glucose, and type 2 diabetic), and blood pressure (normotensive and hypertensive).

40|$|Purpose: Close {{examination}} of epidemiological data revealed burdens of {{type 2 diabetes}} and complications particular to ethnic minorities in the United States including African immigrants. Literature reviews show poor <b>dietary</b> <b>plan,</b> physical inactivity, and poor stress management exist among African immigrants; contributing factors to these behaviors are cultural beliefs, barriers to physical activity, knowledge deficit in stress management, healthy food choices and portioning. This DNP project focused on implementing a culturally tailored diabetes education with the objective to increase participants’ knowledge on dietary planning, physical activity, and stress management. Greater patient knowledge may lead to better diabetes management among African immigrants in the U. S. Method: Three-sessions of culturally tailored diabetes education were delivered to African immigrant adults (N= 9) with Type 2 diabetes in Rhode Island. Behavioral change education was based on three of the American Association of Diabetes (ADA) self-care behaviors: healthy eating, physical activity, and stress management. Each session lasted approximately 2. 5 hours. Demographic information of the participants was obtained using a questionnaire.

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) requires continuous medical care, patients′ self-management, education, and {{adherence to}} prescribed medication {{to reduce the}} risk of long-term complications. The aim of this study was to assess the benefits of an education program on diabetes, patient self-management, adherence to medication, anxiety, depression and glycemic control in type 2 diabetics in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study, conducted among 104 diabetic patients at a major tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between May 2011 and October 2012. Education materials given to diabetic patients included pamphlets/handouts written in Arabic, the national language. Special videotapes about DM were made and distributed to all participants. In addition, specific educational programs through the diabetes educators and one-on-one counseling sessions with the doctor were also arranged. Patients were interviewed using a structured interview schedule both during the baseline, and after 6 months of the program. The interview schedule included, socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, diabetes self-management, adherence to medication, anxiety, and depression. Glycemic control was considered poor, if hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) was ≥ 7 %. Results: The mean age of the study population was 57. 3 ΁ 14. 4 years. Seventy one were males (68. 3 %) and 33 (31. 7 %) were females.

Participants completed diet records during the study period and also rated their overall compliance to the assigned <b>dietary</b> <b>plan.</b> Results Compliance to both dietary plans proved to be satisfactory (approximately 80 % in the 6 th month; 85 % in the 3 rd month and 95 % during the 3 rd week). It is noteworthy that it did not show any major differences between groups. Body weight, from baseline toward month 6, saw a decline in participants assigned to both the traditional DF (79. 6 ± 5. 3 to 75. 5 ± 5. 5 kg) and the modified DF (80. 4 ± 8. 0 to 74. 3 ± 6. 5 kg). Conclusion These data indicated that both the traditional and modified DF, which involve ad libitum (Latin for “at liberty”) feeding, are realistic for individuals to comply with {{over a period of several}} months.

30|$|The {{low energy}} intake {{the first years}} post surgery is {{challenging}} for the LSG patients as they need both a detailed <b>dietary</b> <b>plan</b> and dietary supplements to achieve sufficient intake of macro and micro nutrients, since {{it is difficult to}} meet the daily requirements of vitamins and minerals with a daily energy intake below 8.4  MJ (FAO/WHO 2001). Also, the removal of most of the fundus and hence the reduction in parietal cells, in addition to nausea, vomiting and food intolerance experienced by some put LSG patients at high risk for nutrient deficiencies. It has been suggested that LSG has little impact on macronutrient deficiency since the procedure is restrictive and therefore does not alter the absorption in the small intestine (Baltasar et al. 2005). However, after LSG the stomach contents may empty more rapidly into the small intestine (Melissas et al. 2007), which in turn may reduce the bioavailability and absorption of nutrients. Although the median albumin level was decreased, the serum albumin level was normal in the majority of our patients both preoperatively and postoperatively, and thus one can assume that in general the patients had an overall sufficient protein intake after one year, which is in line with findings by others (Damms-Machado et al. 2012; Hamoui et al. 2006).|$|E

It makes links between some of the recent work on the body and habit which suggests, broadly speaking, that habit is an important way of understanding the body, the social and the temporal, and recent work on the body and animation and automation. This latter set of literature explores how animation, traditionally the preserve of the human, is now also a capacity of non-human entities or technologies and, as such, raises questions as to whether the dichotomies of human/non-human, bodies/technologies and nature/culture can hold. The article examines how a prevalent framing of the blurring of the distinction between animation and automation is to see various technologies as ‘creeping’ into the realm of the body, threatening to turn humans into automations. However, through a focus on critical arguments about the impossibility of maintaining dichotomies, it argues that the 5 : 2 plan can be understood to emerge from an awareness of, and as a response to, a temporally and socially specific configuration of nature and culture, bodies and technologies, and animation and automation...|$|E

For this, a computational method is presented for comparing a bivariate lognormal distribution to a health criterion value. Procedures to meta-analyse available data in different ways are described. Example calculations on vitamin B- 12 requirements were made for four models, assuming different ways of estimating the dose-response relation, and different values of the health criterion.
