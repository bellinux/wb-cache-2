5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E

Juventus {{have played in}} black and white striped shirts, and with white or sometimes black shorts, since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie, which only occurred due to the wrong shirts being sent to them, the father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them.

500|$|Newton likely {{introduced}} her to the writings of William Wordsworth, and his gift to her of Ralph Waldo Emerson's first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little Girl, I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>who</b> taught me Immortality– but venturing too near, himself– he never returned"—refers to Newton.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team wanted the episode {{to be about}} trash, and show runner Mike Scully pitched the idea that Homer should run for office. Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> had made their way in Chicago politics, through the Sanitation Commission, and so he decided that Homer should run for Sanitation Commissioner. They then {{spent a lot of}} time trying to get to the point that Homer would have an [...] "over filled trash can", and through its extensive use of packaging, the concept of Love Day was formed. Originally the episode saw Homer running for mayor, but this idea was abandoned. The ending was talked about for a while, with the original idea being that the whole town would be raised up and the rubbish be swept underneath. The ending was not intended to carry an environmental message, but it played well and is what the staff believe won the episode an Emmy.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Samuel bar Nachmani told {{a parable}} {{to explain the}} words of [...] "But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it." [...] Rabbi Samuel taught that {{it is as if}} there were a king's {{daughter}} who was not acquainted with any man, and the king <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> could visit him at any time, and the princess waited on the friend. The king told the friend that this indicated how much the king loved him, for no one was acquainted with his daughter, yet she waited upon the friend. Similarly, God told Israel that it indicated how beloved Israel was to God, for no being in God’s palace was acquainted with the Torah, yet God entrusted it to Israel. As [...] says, [...] "Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living," [...] but as for the Children of Israel (as [...] says), [...] "It is not too hard for you [...] [...] [...] but the word is very near to you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hunts, {{like the}} Riverses, were an {{established}} naval and Church of England family. One of those {{destined for the}} pulpit was Thomas (1802–1851), but some quirk of originality set him off into an unusual career. [...] While an undergraduate at Cambridge, Thomas Hunt <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> stammered badly and his efforts to aid the afflicted student led {{him to leave the}} University without taking a degree {{in order to make a}} thorough study of speech and its defects. He built up a good practice as a speech therapist and was patronised by Sir John Forbes MD FRS, who sent him pupils for twenty four years. [...] Hunt's most famous case came about in 1842 when George Pearson, the chief witness in the case respecting the attempt on the life of Queen Victoria made by John Francis, was brought into court he was incapable of giving his evidence. However, after just a fortnight's instruction from Hunt he spoke easily, a fact certified by the sitting magistrate. Hunt died in 1851, survived by his wife Mary and their two children. His practice was then passed on to his son, James.|$|E

2500|$|Reading God's {{criticism}} of Moses in [...] "Because {{you did not}} believe in Me," [...] a Midrash asked whether Moses had not previously said worse when in [...] he showed a greater lack of faith and questioned God's powers asking: [...] "If flocks and herds be slain for them, will they suffice them? Or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, will they suffice them?" [...] The Midrash explained by relating the case of a king who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> displayed arrogance towards the king privately, using harsh words. The king did not, however, lose his temper with his friend. Later, the friend displayed his arrogance {{in the presence of the}} king's legions, and the king sentenced his friend to death. So also God told Moses that the first offense that Moses committed (in [...] ) was a private matter between Moses and God. But now that Moses had committed a second offense against God in public, it was impossible for God to overlook it, and God had to react, as [...] reports, [...] "To sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Darren Smith <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>who</b> {{was going}} through {{bankruptcy}} and whose possessions were going into foreclosure. Inspired by this, Smith {{came up with the}} idea of a future where not only one's property, but also one's body parts, could be repossessed. Smith and Terrance Zdunich collaborated ideas and plot lines to create [...] "The Necromerchant's Debt". The first version of Repo! was The Necromerchant's Debt, which told the story of a Graverobber in debt to a Repo Organ Man. It was first performed at the John Raitt theater in 2002. After being such a success, creators Smith and Zdunich expanded on the universe to create all of the storylines that became Repo! The Genetic Opera later in 2002. Many changes were made, gradually, to the characters and music throughout the show's various incarnations through 2005. For example, Rotti, in the earliest performances, was not the father to Luigi, Pavi, and Amber. Instead, he was a younger brother to Luigi and Pavi, while Amber was Luigi's daughter. Lyrics were adjusted to new arcs, and some songs were dropped altogether, for example, [...] "But This Is Opera!", which was cut out in an effort to change the direction of Blind Mag's character. After years of being performed as a stage play, Repo! was adapted into a 10-minute short film directed and financed by Darren Lynn Bousman to pitch the idea to film studios. The film starred Shawnee Smith as Amber Sweet (then named [...] "Heather Sweet"), Michael Rooker as the Repo Man, Kristen Fairlie as Shilo, Terrance Zdunich as GraveRobber, and J. Larose as Pavi.|$|E
