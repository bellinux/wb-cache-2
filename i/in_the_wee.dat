40|$|Abstract. We {{have used}} a new cinemicroscopy {{technique}} in combination with antitubulin immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate the timing of mitotic events <b>in</b> cells of <b>the</b> fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe having lengths at division between 7 and 60 #m. Wild-type fission yeast cells divide at a length of 14 #m. Separation of daughter nuclei (anaphase B) proceeds {{at a rate of}} 1. 6 + 0. 2 ttm min-~, until the spindle extends the length of the cell. Coincident with spindle depolymerization, the nuclei reverse direction and take up positions that will become the center of the two daughter cells. This postmitotic nuclear migration occurs at a rate of 1. 4 + 0. 5 #m- 1. In cells <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> 1 ÷ gene is overex-pressed fivefold and that have an average length at mitosis of 28 /xm, the rate of nuclear separation was only slightly reduced but, as spindles in these cells measure 20 - 22 /~m, the duration of anaphase B was extended by,x, 40 %. By contrast, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mutant <b>wee</b> 1. 50, which divides at 7 #m, both the rate and duration of anaphase B were indistinguishable from wild type. Nuclei reach the ends of these cells earlier but remain there until a point corresponding to the time of postmitotic nuclear migration in wild type.

50|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> of Ivory Coast, {{it is also}} {{believed}} that the natural world {{is made up of}} spirits, referred to as “bush spirits.” These spirits are part of the world untouched by man, and <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> believe that keeping these spirits appeased is vital {{to the health of the}} tribe. Whenever new land requires cultivating for fields or expansion, or when tribesmen needed to venture outside the village, it becomes necessary to make offerings to the spirits, with such endeavors being surrounded by an air of danger. It is further believed that the bush spirits take corporeal form in order to interact with the villagers and participate <b>in</b> ceremonies. <b>The</b> <b>Wee</b> feel that <b>the</b> bush spirits can communicate with humans through dreams, often demanding ceremonial masks be created in their honor in either male or female forms. These masks then serve a variety of functions ranging from ritual ceremonies, forms of entertainment, and focal points in moral stories to judicial and political controls. Typically, female masks are viewed as less imposing and more beautiful than male masks and are in turn used more for ritual and entertainment purposes, while the male masks are often more ferocious-looking and serve roles in sociopolitical issues. That said, all Wee masks are believed to deflect sorcery attacks, and many undergo shifts in their primary function during their lifetime.|$|R

40|$|<b>In</b> higher eukaryotes, <b>the</b> cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are {{negatively}} {{regulated by}} phosphorylation on threonine 14 (T 14) and tyrosine 15 (Y 15). <b>In</b> fission yeast, <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> 1 and mitosis inhibitory kinase 1 (Mik 1) protein kinases phosphorylate Y 15 in Cdc 2. WEE 1 Hu {{is the only}} known protein kinase that can carry out this inhibitory phosphorylation on Y 15 in higher eukaryotes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, we examined the endogenous products of WEE 1 Hu in human cells and found that <b>the</b> original <b>WEE</b> 1 Hu cDNA lacked 214 amino acids at the N-terminus. The predicted full-length protein has weak, but significant, similarity over its entire length with Mik 1. Thus, we suggest that 'WEE 1 Hu' is a Mik 1 -related protein rather than a Wee 1 homologue. When isolated <b>in</b> immunoprecipitates, <b>the</b> endogenous <b>WEE</b> 1 Hu phosphorylated several cyclin-associated CDKs on Y 15.
