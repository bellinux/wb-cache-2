5000|$|Hungarian sausages, when {{smoked and}} cured, are called kolbász - {{different}} types are often distinguished by their typical regions, e.g. gyulai and csabai sausage. As no collective word for [...] "sausage" [...] in the English sense exists in <b>Hungarian,</b> local <b>salamis</b> (see e.g. winter salami) and boiled sausages [...] "hurka" [...] {{are often not}} considered when listing regional sausage varieties. The most common boiled sausages are rice liver sausage ("Májas Hurka") and blood sausage ("Véres Hurka"). In the first case, the main ingredient is liver, mixed with rice stuffing. In the latter, the blood is mixed with rice, or pieces of bread rolls. Spices, pepper, salt and marjoram are added.|$|R

Specifically we draw on stated preference data from a discrete choice experiment, considering the traditional <b>Hungarian</b> mangalitza <b>salami.</b> A WTP space specification of the generalized multinomial logit model is employed, which accounts for not only heterogeneity in preferences but also differences in {{the scale of the}} idiosyncratic error term. Results indicate that traditional food products can command a substantial premium, albeit contingent on effective quality certification, authentic product composition and effective choice of retail outlet. Promising consumer segments and policy implications are identified...|$|R

50|$|Winter salami (in Téliszalámi) {{is a type}} of <b>Hungarian</b> <b>salami</b> {{produced}} {{according to}} a centuries-old tradition. Made from Mangalitsa pork and spices (white pepper, allspice, and others), winter salami is cured in cold air and smoked slowly. During the dry ripening process, a special noble-mold is formed on the casing surface.|$|E
50|$|Many Old World salami {{are named}} after their region or country of origin—such as Arles, Genoa, <b>Hungarian,</b> and Milano <b>salami.</b> Many are flavored with garlic. Some types—including some {{varieties}} from Spain (salchichón), Hungary (pick salami), and Italy (such as Neapolitan varieties {{that led to}} American pepperoni) include paprika or chili powder. Varieties also differ by coarseness or fineness of the chopped meat and size and style of the casing.|$|R
5000|$|Founded on 12 October 1930, the {{original}} party won {{an overwhelming majority}} in the first elections after the Second World War, resulting in its leader, Zoltán Tildy, becoming prime minister. In the relatively free elections in November 1945, the Smallholders' polled 57% of votes against the Communists' 17%. The Communist response was to intensify terror and to sponsor the coalition of [...] "democratic" [...] parties against the [...] "reactionary" [...] smallholders. The Smallholders-dominated parliament established a republic in 1946 with Tildy as president. He was succeeded as prime minister by Ferenc Nagy. However, the Soviet occupation of the country, the <b>Hungarian</b> Communist Party's <b>salami</b> tactic to break up opponent parties and widespread election fraud in 1947 elections led to a communist government.|$|R

5000|$|More than 400 {{volatile}} compounds {{have been}} identified in different types of dry-fermented sausages. For example, the organic compounds identified in <b>Hungarian</b> <b>salami</b> produced the dominant flavours of smokiness, sweetness, pungency, sourness, and cloves; secondary flavours included cooked meat, cheese, popcorn, cooked potato, mushroom, seasoning, phenols, roasting, sulfur, and sweatiness. Some minor flavours included malt, garlic, fruit, pine, grass, citrus, honey, caramel, and vanilla. [...] The overall smoky note is the result of numerous phenols. Whether these odorants are formed in the salami or simply transferred from the raw materials during manufacturing is unknown; systematic studies have yet to compare the odorants present in the raw materials to those in the final product.|$|E
5000|$|Salami is a raw-fermented sausage {{consisting}} of raw comminuted pork and/or beef meat, fat, and additives, such as curing salt, spices, sugar, and a starter culture. There are multiple {{different types of}} Salami meat in various markets around the world. In northern and central Europe, smoked salamis are preferred, and ripening {{is controlled by the}} addition of lactic acid-producing starter cultures, whereas in southern Europe, salami is slowly air-dried and mostly mold-ripened. Therefore, different preservation and drying methods are used around the world to prepare salami. Hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. The salami that is of Hungarian origin, the so-called [...] "Hungarian Winter salami", is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. Szegedi téliszalámi (winter salami) is made of mangalitsa pork breed, with horse large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months. [...] <b>Hungarian</b> <b>salami</b> is one of the world's two trade names for salami, Milano salami being the other. These fermented sausages combine smoke and mold application in one. The traditional technology used to produce them is based on the Italian pre-drying technique developed during the nineteenth century, but they are smoked and their pH does not drop below 5.5, so the final flavor of the product is not acidic.|$|E
