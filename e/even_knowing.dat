25|$|Questioned by police, Collins flatly denied <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> Schell, {{and insisted}} {{he had spent}} the weekend of June 29–30 with his mother at her house in the Detroit suburb of Center Line, and had not {{returned}} to Ypsilanti until the morning of July 1. Initially, police took him at his word, and did not seek to verify his alibi.|$|E
25|$|Coastal California has a {{rich history}} of marine {{utilization}} by Native Americans and early settlers. Cordell Bank {{was a mystery}} prior to the 19th century because neither the Miwok natives nor the settlers had any incentive to venture far out from shore, when food resources were available close to shore. Many European mariners sailed right over Cordell Bank without <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it was there.|$|E
25|$|Harry and Edna are {{the most}} obvious escapees as they run from their own home and set up camp {{in the home of}} Agnes and Tobias. They run from a general sense of fear or dread, not <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> what they are afraid of.

60|$|When {{the painter}} {{and his family}} had gone back from their bathing holiday, he thought that he, too, would leave the neighbourhood. To do so, however, without wishing at least the elder Avice good-bye would be unfriendly, {{considering}} the extent of their acquaintance. One <b>evening,</b> <b>knowing</b> this time of day to suit her best, he took the few-minutes' journey to the rock along the thin connecting string of junction, and arrived at Mrs. Pierston's door just after dark.|$|R

25|$|Joplin {{appeared}} at Woodstock starting at approximately 2:00a.m., on Sunday, August 17, 1969. She followed Creedence Clearwater Revival. Despite her reportedly not <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> of the festival's existence {{until a few}} days earlier, the Woodstock promoters advertised her as a headliner. She thus {{became one of the}} main attractions of the historic concert. Her friend Peggy Caserta claims in her book, Going Down With Janis (1973), that she had encouraged a reluctant Joplin to perform at Woodstock.|$|E

However, selected trainees with extraneous circumstances can send a letter of appeal to be exempted from the training, which will usually be approved.|$|E

The two have gotten really close over the years but after seeing Shigure with Yukina, offers to help Yukina get closer to Shigure for some reason unknown to her. While Mami appears sweet and well mannered on the outside, in reality she is very cunning and gets jealous when she sees Shigure with Yukina. She is prone to social stress, and as informed by Shigure, she calms down when someone pats her on the head. Mami soon {{falls in love with}} Akira, and <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> that he likes Yukina, she still confesses to him and they started going out.|$|E
25|$|Onion routing is {{implemented}} by encryption {{in the application}} layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or <b>even</b> <b>knowing,</b> the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single {{point at which the}} communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Abu Simbel the heroes {{are joined by}} Iggy, a Boston Terrier and the user of The Fool, a simple but powerful Stand of sand. They are immediately attacked by the blind Stand user N'Doul, who attacks with Geb, a Stand of water and {{the first of the}} nine Egyptian god Stands; he is able to slash through Kakyoin's corneas before he is defeated by Jotaro and Iggy. Afterwards, Kakyoin is taken to a hospital to recuperate. Oingo and Boingo, users of the face-altering Stand Khnum and the future-predicting comic book Thoth respectively, attempt to defeat the heroes, but Oingo (in disguise as Jotaro) is incapacitated without the heroes <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> he was there. Anubis, a sword with a Stand, possesses a farmer named Chaka, a barber named Khan, and then Polnareff, nearly killing Jotaro before being thrown in a river to rust away. Mariah, the user of Bast, magnetizes Joseph and Avdol causing problems for them before they overcome her attacks and crush her between themselves. Meanwhile, Polnareff and Silver Chariot are reduced to children by Seth, the shadow Stand of the sadistic child-abuser Alessi. Polnareff outsmarts Alessi before he is attacked by a de-aged Jotaro; Polnareff and Jotaro return to their old selves before beating up Alessi. Later, the group encounters Daniel J. D'Arby, who offers information if they gamble with him, but when Polnareff and Joseph lose, D'Arby's Stand Osiris transforms their souls into poker chips. Only by betting everyone's souls and bluffing his way through D'Arby's rigged game can Jotaro defeat him. In Cairo the group meets Hol Horse again, who has partnered himself with Boingo, but the duo are defeated through their own incompetence. Later, Iggy battles Pet Shop, DIO's pet falcon and the user of the ice-slinging Stand Horus. Kakyoin returns soon afterwards, his eyesight mostly recovered.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with IV tubing inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether he would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I guess you could say I loved the Bible without <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Footage of {{the game}} in its alpha state was posted to YouTube by Coffee Stain, where it {{received}} more than a million views in two days and a large response from fans requesting a full release {{of the game}} in part due to various glitches in the prototype's engine. The appeal of the video was also picked up by the agricultural magazine Modern Farmer. Some journalists suggested that the title be developed into a full game <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it was meant as a joking title; GameSpot editor Danny O'Dwyer supported the full release of the game arguing that [...] "games should be dumb once in a while".|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the Mosawa Center for Arab Rights in Israel {{paid for}} ads on {{television}} and radio stations in Israel. In the television ads, the Arabic phrase for [...] "have a nice day" [...] would flash onto the screen in black letters and on a red background. Immediately following the Arabic phrase would be a Hebrew phrase that said, [...] "Are you already against it without <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> what it says? All we wanted to say is have a nice day." [...] Spokeswoman Abir Kopty stated that [...] "he purpose of this campaign was mainly to cause the Israeli public sitting at home, or walking down the street, to ask itself why it had a negative reaction to everything Arab, {{even if it is}} the simplest phrase." [...] Kopty further said that the Mosawa Center wanted to encourage Arabs to be more active and more visible in the community.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things always seem to fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E

The performance on Friday night was [...] "The Beatles in Symphony" [...] and featured a ‘Fab Four’ tribute band from Colorado with the Aargauer Jugend Pops Symphony Orchestra conducted by Renold himself. Ian Darrington, Wigan Festival Director and IAJE representative, wrote: “This concert truly represented what musical performance is all about. It had… every emotion from laughter to tears {{and everything in}} between. It had people tapping their feet to the faster tunes and swaying to the slower tunes. It featured outstanding musical arrangements performed to an extremely high level...and great rapport with the capacity audience, every one of whom must have gone home that <b>evening</b> <b>knowing</b> they had {{been a part of}} such a special evening.” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{completeness}} {{property of}} the reals is the basis on which calculus, and, more generally mathematical analysis are built.

500|$|Certain {{characters}} have seemingly supernatural abilities {{from the beginning}} of the series. Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe not only have common visions of two soldiers (one of them also appearing in a tuxedo) and a man with a tattooed tree on his chest, but also of each other. Ben can heal and resurrect beings at the cost of others' life, while Brother Justin can read and manipulate people's minds. Ben and Lodz, a blind mentalist of the carnival, experience visions of the medieval Knights Templar. Carnival fortuneteller Sofie can communicate telepathically with her catatonic mother, whom she once sees being raped by the Tattooed Man. The progressing story increases the importance of the two mysterious soldiers, who are revealed as Henry Scudder and Management. Strange words of unknown meaning appear throughout the series. Variations of the phrase [...] "Every Prophet in his House" [...] are repeated, seemingly without context. Ben finds the repeating letter string TARAVATARAVA in a mineshaft, which he is later able to interpret as Avatar. Season 2 introduces the word Usher in particular relation to Brother Justin. Management repeats this term to Ben in two instances. After Management's death, Ben has sudden knowledge about Princes, Prophets and the Usher, <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> to whom these terms apply, respectively. The sentence [...] "Sofie is the Omega" [...] is seen once, written across a mirror without further explanation. Sofie demonstrates powers and attributes similar to those of Ben and Brother Justin in the last Carnivàle episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It could be one of my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without <b>even</b> <b>knowing</b> it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone has you fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{external}} controls and restrictions {{placed on a}} slave's sexuality, Roman art and literature perversely often portray slaves as lascivious, voyeuristic, and <b>even</b> sexually <b>knowing.</b> One of the themes of Roman comedy that distinguishes it from its Greek models is the depiction of master-slave relations.|$|R
50|$|In genetic engineering, {{transposon}} tagging is {{a process}} where transposons (transposable elements) are amplified inside a biological cell by a tagging technique.
