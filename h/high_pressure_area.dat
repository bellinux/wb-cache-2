5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area,</b> the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Nine-E was {{influenced}} by a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> located over Mexico, causing it to move 16mph (26km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> near their centers towards the lower <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> further from their centers.

5|$|After {{landfall}} {{the storm}} rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing frontal zone that extended eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to its east, the remnants {{turned to the}} north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4.|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to the north, it slowed drastically and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began {{to take a more}} northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an ill-defined center. By September24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop.|$|E

5|$|On January1, 2002, the JTWC {{classified}} {{the depression}} as a tropical storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. The system rapidly organized shortly after and was further upgraded to a moderate tropical storm by Météo-France at 0600UTC, {{at which time}} the Meteorological Service of Madagascar gave it the name Cyprien. In response to a mid to upper-level subtropical <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area,</b> the storm tracked in a general eastward direction at 16km/h (10mph). Several hours after being named, the JTWC assessed Cyprien to have reached its peak winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds). QuickSCAT satellite passes indicated areas of 100km/h (65mph) winds early on January2, prompting Météo-France to upgrade Cyprien to a severe tropical storm, with winds peaking at 100km/h (65mph 10-minute winds). By this time, the central barometric pressure fell to 980hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and unsettled weather indicated that a storm was forming in the vicinity.

The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

40|$|Aims To {{test the}} Podotrack, a simple {{inexpensive}} semiquantitative footprint mat, for potential {{use as a}} screening tool for <b>high</b> plantar <b>pressures,</b> against the optical pedobarograph (a computerized device). Methods The Podotrack was superimposed on the pedobarograph for simultaneous measurement of pressures from both systems. Three independent observers quantified the pressures of Podotrack footprints from healthy controls and diabetic patients, both before (n = 164) and after (n = 183) training. The sensitivity of the Podotrack to identify <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas</b> measured by the pedobarograph (> 12. 3 kg/cm 2) was 78. 7 %, 45. 8 % and 44. 3 % (observer A, B and C) before training, but improved to 96. 2 %, 92. 4 % and 91. 1 % after training (P < 0. 01). Specificity for all three observers was more than 90 % before and after training. Inter-observer agreement improved significantly after training (P < 0. 001). Conclusion After a simple training of the observers, the Podotrack identified approximately all <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>areas,</b> suggesting that the Podotrack could be a useful screening tool to identify areas at risk of ulceration in diabetic patients. We recommend a standard training package for new Podotrack users, to optimize identification of diabetic patients at risk of foot ulceration...|$|R
40|$|Average July {{heights and}} winds over a 10 -yr period are {{computed}} at 850 mb over Mexico using both surface and radiosonde data.

5|$|A {{relatively}} strong tropical wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the northwest}} coast of Africa on August15. Moving westward, the wave split while well east of the Lesser Antilles, with a portion developing into Tropical Depression Seven on August21, which eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris. The remaining portion of the wave continued westward and reached the Caribbean Sea as a disorganized center of showers. During the night of August 29, some cloud banding developed, followed by {{the formation of a}} low-level center over the Yucatán Peninsula on August30. Shortly after entering the Bay of Campeche on August31, the system was given a T1.5 rating on the Dvorak scale, based on appearance on satellite imagery. As a result, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 18:00UTC on August31. Cloud banding and outflow patterns became further organized on September1. The depression moved generally west-northwestward, steered by a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> situated over the Eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|After moving ashore, {{the storm}} quickly {{weakened}} into a tropical depression while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula. Late on July19, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. It {{turned to the}} northwest due to a ridge moving eastward, and the system re-intensified into a tropical storm on July 21. At around 0800 UTC on July 23, the storm moved ashore on Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas with winds of about 45 mph (75 km/h). The storm again weakened to a tropical depression shortly after landfall, before turning {{to the north and}} north-northeast. On July 24, the cyclone began interacting with a cold front, and became extratropical. It tracked slowly eastward across eastern Texas and northern Louisiana due to a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to the north.

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav {{remained}} well offshore, the difference in pressure between it and a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> over the central United States caused strong winds in areas of New Jersey on September 11.

The strong winds downed trees and power lines throughout {{the eastern half of}} the state, damaging homes and blocking streets. At least 14,000 homes in the vicinity of Burlington and Ocean Counties were left without power. In West Windsor Township, a man was killed when the upper section of a concrete wall he was working on blew over and crushed him. The other death occurred in West Amwell Township, where a tree limb fell on two elderly women, killing one and injuring the other.

5|$|The {{interaction}} between a tropical wave and a upper-level low moving southeastward from Texas spawned a broad trough over the central Gulf of Mexico on October24. That day, {{there was a}} marked increase in convection, or thunderstorms. At the same time, the pressure gradient between the trough and a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> over the southeastern United States produced winds of near gale force across the northern Gulf of Mexico. Early on October 26, a tropical depression developed about 380 mi (610 km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Within 12 hours, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Juan, based on satellite imagery and reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Initially, the structure was akin {{to that of a}} subtropical cyclone, with light winds near the center. Juan moved erratically at first, eventually tracking more steadily to the north-northeast on October 27. After turning to the northwest late on October 27, Juan intensified into a hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} spawned a tropical depression on October31 a short distance to south of easternmost Cuba. The system tracked northward and crossed over eastern Cuba, and the system initially had characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. It eventually acquired tropical features and intensified into Tropical Storm Greta on November1. A <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> east of the Mid-Atlantic states caused the depression {{to turn to the}} south on November2 and loop to the southeast. Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the northeast of the Bahamas. It attained hurricane status on November4 while maintaining a large size (in fact, becoming one of the largest tropical cyclones known in the Atlantic basin); such strengthening is unusual in storms moving in a southeast trajectory. Greta turned to the east and later northeast, reaching its peak of 100mph (155km/h) late on November4 due to the energy transfer between levels of the atmosphere. Cooler waters caused subsequent weakening and gradual loss of tropical characteristics, and Greta transitioned into an extratropical storm on November6, dissipating the next day.|$|E

50|$|If {{these factors}} {{do not support}} {{precipitation}} volumes sufficient to reach the surface over a sufficient period of time, {{the result is a}} drought.

Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air, hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging, and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions.

5|$|The slow-moving {{hurricane}} battered the Texas shoreline {{for several}} days from October3 through 5, and continued eastward parallel to the Gulf Coast. It passed the Sabine River {{on the night of}} October5–6, and later struck southeastern Louisiana near Venice. At New Orleans, the worst of the storm came late on October6 with winds from the south and southeast. Extensive damage to forests in interior Louisiana and Mississippi indicated that the strongest winds occurred away from the coast, on the northern side of the hurricane's circulation. This was likely the result of a tight pressure gradient between the storm and the expansive <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> centered over the Ohio Valley. According to weather historian David Ludlum, the storm likely moved ashore between Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. Although the cyclone's path across the southern United States is uncertain, it was located along the coast of the Carolinas as a minimal hurricane by October8, and subsequently exited into the Atlantic. It continued northeastward, ultimately passing north of Bermuda as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} to land, Greta initially maintained a well-defined structure. The hurricane continued generally west-northwestward {{due to the}} ridge to the north, and initially was expected to enter the Bay of Campeche. After passing through the Bay Islands off northern Honduras, Greta weakened slightly while approaching Belize, and made landfall near Dangriga at 0000UTC on September19, with winds of about 110mph (175km/h). The calm of the eye was reported for three to five minutes there. Rapidly weakening over land, the hurricane deteriorated to tropical depression status over Guatemala within 12hours of landfall. A large <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> from the Carolinas to the central Gulf of Mexico turned Greta southwestward toward the eastern Pacific Ocean. At 0000UTC on September20, the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC) took over responsibility for issuing advisories while Greta was 30mi (50km) from the coast. Soon after, the depression emerged over the warm waters of the eastern Pacific and re-intensified. At 0600UTC, the depression re-attained tropical storm status and named Olivia by the EPHC. After initially moving to the north, Olivia began executing a slow counterclockwise loop. Based on observations from nearby ships and radar, it is estimated Olivia attained hurricane status early on September22. While tracking towards the Mexican coastline, the system weakened below hurricane threshold; between 1900 and 2000UTC, Olivia made landfall about 60mi (95km) east of Salina Cruz. Early on September23, Olivia dissipated over the Mexican state of Chiapas.|$|E
5|$|From September 28 to October 7, 33ships {{reported}} {{winds of}} over 40mph (65km/h) {{in relation to}} Kate, though nearly all occurred as the storm was becoming extratropical. The highest wind reported was 59mph (95km/h), while the lowest pressure reported from a ship was 989mbar. The interaction between Kate and a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>area</b> to its north produced 3–4foot (1m) waves {{along the coast of}} North Carolina and New England. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to 40mph (65km/h) at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of 9–13feet (3–4m). The combination of moisture from Kate and a stalled frontal system produced moderate amounts of rainfall, with some regions in southeastern Newfoundland receiving more than 4inches (100mm). St. John's reported 1.8inches (45mm) on October 6, a record for the date. Due to dry conditions in the preceding weeks, the ground easily absorbed the water, resulting in a lack of flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to 70mph (110km/h) in northern Scotland. Overall, there were no reports of damage or deaths associated with Kate.|$|E
