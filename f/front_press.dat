5000|$|Troy Southgate (born 22 July 1965) is a British far-right {{political}} activist and a self-described National-Anarchist.

Southgate's movement has been described as working to [...] "exploit a burgeoning counter culture of industrial heavy metal music, paganism, esotericism, occultism and Satanism that, it believes, holds the key to the spiritual reinvigoration of western society ready for an essentially Evolian revolt against the culturally and racially enervating forces of American global capitalism." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Earth Liberation Army (ELA), {{similar to}} the Earth Liberation Front (ELF), is the {{collective}} name for anonymous and autonomous individuals or groups that use [...] "economic sabotage and guerrilla warfare to stop the exploitation and destruction of the natural environment", commonly known as ecotage or monkeywrenching. The name was first used in Canada, in 1995, {{which was the first}} Earth liberation direct action in North America, three years after the ELF had been founded in England. The ELA is also a leaderless movement, although in contrast to the ELF, the first group did not publish any guidelines. The ELA are considered to be [...] "eco-terrorists" [...] by governments, and are also known to also be active in the United States (see North American Earth Liberation <b>Front</b> <b>Press</b> Office).|$|E
5000|$|From 1997 to 2001, Rosebraugh {{served as}} a {{spokesperson}} for the Earth Liberation Front receiving anonymous communiques from the ELF and forwarding them on to news media internationally. In 1999, Rosebraugh co-formed the North American Earth Liberation <b>Front</b> <b>Press</b> Office (NAELFPO) with Leslie James Pickering, where he continued to forward communiques, conduct international press interviews, and nationwide informational lectures on the ideology of the ELF movement. Between 1997 and 2006, Rosebraugh received eight subpoenas to appear before federal grand juries to discuss his sources, but he has said he has no knowledge of them and refused to cooperate with the proceedings. The New York Times Magazine dubbed him the [...] "Face of Ecoterrorism" [...] in 1998. In 2002 he appeared, under power of subpoena, in front of the U.S. Congress in a House Resources Subcommittee hearing on eco-terrorism. During the hearing, Rosebraugh took the Fifth Amendment to 54 of 56 questions asked by Congress, effectively stonewalling the proceeding. He did issue Congress an eleven-page written testimony charging the U.S. government with being [...] "one of the most horrific terrorist organizations in planetary history." ...|$|E

40|$|Context: Various studies report {{decreased}} muscle activation in the concavity of {{the curve}} in patients with scoliosis. Such decreased muscle-performance capacity could lead to sustained postural deficits. Objective: To investigate whether specific asymmetrical sports therapy exercises rather than symmetrical back strengthening can increase EMG amplitudes of paraspinal muscles in the concavity {{of the curve}}. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 16 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Interventions: Patients performed 4 back-strengthening exercises (<b>front</b> <b>press,</b> lat pull-down, roman chair, bent-over barbell row) during 1 test session. Each exercise was performed in a symmetrical and asymmetrical variant and repeated 3 times. Main Outcome Measure: EMG amplitudes of the paraspinal muscles were recorded in the thoracic and lumbar apexes of the scoliotic curve during each exercise. Ratios of convex- to concave-side EMG activity were calculated. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that the asymmetrical variants of <b>front</b> <b>press</b> at the lumbar level (P =. 002) and roman chair and bent-over barbell row at the thoracic level (P <. 0001,. 001 respectively) were superior in increasing EMG amplitudes in the concavity of the scoliotic curve. Conclusions: Specific asymmetrical exercises increase EMG amplitudes of paraspinal muscles in the concavity. If confirmed in longitudinal studies measuring improvements of postural deficits, these exercises may advance care of patients with scoliosis...|$|E
