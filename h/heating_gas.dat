50|$|In the Red Leaf Resources EcoShale In-Capsule Process a hot gas is {{generated}} by burning natural gas or pyrolysis gas. Generated hot gas is then circulated through oil shale rubble using sets of parallel pipes. The heat is transferred to the shale through the pipe walls rather than being injected directly into the rubble, thereby avoiding dilution of the product hydrocarbons with the <b>heating</b> <b>gas.</b> The oil shale rubble is enclosed by a low-cost earthen impoundment structure to prevent environmental contamination and to provide easier and more rapid reclamation after the extraction process is finished. Heat from the spent shale is recovered for enhancing the process's energy efficiency by passing cool gas through pipes and then using it for preheating adjacent capsules.|$|E

[...] The house has twin sinks in the guest bedroom on the second floor, a Turkish smoking room, which is one of the first example of Islamic architecture in the United States, carved marble fireplaces and a flying staircase. When designing the home, Morse had features incorporated into it which were familiar to him from his luxury hotels, including the large and tall entryway and wall-to-wall carpeting. [...] The house was remarkably advanced as well, and used some of the latest technologies of the era (some of which he also took from his hotels) with central <b>heating,</b> <b>gas</b> lighting, hot and cold running water, and a servant call system to name a few. Additionally, as part of a new and unique design, the water for the house was provided by gutters in the tower and third floor, which ran down through pipes into all the rooms, with separate pipes for heated water, which was heated using coal, and another for cold water.|$|E
