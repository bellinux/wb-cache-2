40|$|Objectives: To compare mutans streptococci {{levels in}} saliva, {{before and after}} {{consumption}} of probiotic <b>ice-cream</b> <b>and</b> curds. Materials and Methods: Forty caries free children in {{the age group of}} 12 - 14 years were selected and equally divided into four groups I, II, III, IV. Children in group I and II were given 100 ml probiotic <b>ice-cream</b> <b>and</b> plain ice cream respectively and group III and IV were given 100 ml probiotic curd and plain curd respectively for a period of 7 days. Saliva samples were assessed at baseline, 1 hour after consumption and after 7 days intervention period using Mitis salivarius Bacitracin agar. The number of colonies was counted and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The study revealed a reduction in salivary mutans streptococci (MS) counts after 1 hour in all the groups. However after 7 days, probiotic <b>ice-cream</b> <b>and</b> curd showed a statistically significant (P < 0. 001) reduction in MS counts as compared to the control ice cream and curd. The difference in the reduction of MS counts with probiotic <b>ice-cream</b> <b>and</b> probiotic curd at 1 hour and 7 days was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The use of probiotic products could be an alternative strategy of displacing pathogenic microorganisms by probiotic bacteria and can thus be exploited for the prevention of enamel demineralization...|$|R
