5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> property.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> water resources {{as a resource}} that is {{of interest to the}} Republic of Croatia from the aspect <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> the right of ownership as a property right and <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> the subject matter of property law. It also makes a distinction between <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> water resources {{on the one hand and}} <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> public water resources as public property for common usage on the other hand. The concept, definition and legal status of water resources are presented in the introduction, as the basis for an analysis of the possibility <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of,</b> or limiting the disposal of, water resources. Further, an analysis is made of the basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> property rights in general, and <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> resources that are of interest to the Republic of Croatia and public property for common usage...|$|R

The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> a damaged source, and <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Act, the owner of {{premises}} who created a danger there <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> his duty of care when he <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> the property by selling or leasing it, something North described as both [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "capricious in operation, unjust in the result and indefensible in principle". Section 3(1) of the Act, therefore, establishes that where work is done on premises, whatever duty of care may arise {{as a result of the}} work to people affected by defects in the work is not <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> if the property is sold or let. Section 3(2) qualifies this principle by providing exceptions, which are when the property is the subject of a tenancy and when the property has been <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> (or is in the process <b>of</b> being <b>disposed</b> <b>of)</b> before 1 January 1974, when the Act came into force.|$|R

Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E
