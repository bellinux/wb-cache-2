50|$|Modern CRT {{displays}} {{are less}} susceptible than older CRTs {{prior to the}} 1960s {{because they have a}} layer of aluminum behind the phosphor which offers some protection. The aluminum layer was provided to reflect more light from the phosphor towards the viewer. As a bonus, the aluminum layer also prevented <b>ion</b> <b>burn</b> of the phosphor and the ion trap, common to older monochrome televisions, was no longer required.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum {{antimonide}} {{is rather}} flammable {{because of the}} reducing tendency of the antimonide (Sb3âˆ’) <b>ion.</b> It <b>burns</b> to produce aluminum oxide and antimony trioxide.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the burn}} has been {{initially}} noticed, then HF should be washed {{off with a}} forceful stream of water for ten to fifteen minutes to prevent its further penetration into the body. Clothing used by the person burned may also present a danger. Hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium gluconate, a source of Ca2+ that binds with the fluoride <b>ions.</b> Skin <b>burns</b> can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. [...] Because HF is absorbed, further medical treatment is necessary. Calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Use of calcium chloride is contraindicated and may lead to severe complications. Sometimes surgical excision of tissue or amputation is required.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{absorbed into}} blood through the skin, it reacts with blood calcium and may cause cardiac arrest. Burns with areas larger than 160cm2 (25 square inches) have the {{potential}} to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. [...] In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the etiology for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Thus, hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium gluconate, a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride <b>ions.</b> HF chemical <b>burns</b> can be treated with a water wash and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. However, because it is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary; rinsing off is not enough. Intra-arterial infusions of calcium chloride have also shown great effectiveness in treating burns.|$|R
