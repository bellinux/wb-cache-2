40|$|Objectives. To examine masked {{hypertension}} persistence over 5 years. Methods. White-collar {{workers were}} recruited from three public organizations. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using Spacelabs 90207. Manually operated BP {{was defined as the}} mean of the first three readings taken at rest. Ambulatory BP was defined as the mean of the next readings taken every 15 minutes and recorded during working hours. BP was assessed three times over 5 years.

40|$|Abstract—Hypertension {{is both a}} {{cause and}} a {{consequence}} of chronic kidney disease, but the prevalence of chronic kidney disease throughout the diagnostic spectrum of blood pressure has not been established. We determined the prevalence of chronic kidney disease within blood pressure categories in 17 794 adults surveyed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999 – 2006. Diagnosed <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> self-reported provider diagnosis (n 5832); undiagnosed <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, without report of provider diagnosis (n 3046); prehypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 120 and 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 80 and 90 mm Hg (n 3719); and normal was defined as systolic blood pressure 120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure 80 mm Hg (n 5197). Chronic kidney disease was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 mL/min per 1. 73 m 2 or urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 30 mg/g. Prevalences of chronic kidney disease among those with prehypertension and undiagnosed hypertension were 17. 3 % and 22. 0 %, respectively, compared with 27. 5 % with diagnosed hypertension and 13. 4 % with normal blood pressure, after adjustment for age, sex, and race in multivariable logistic regression. This pattern persisted with varying definitions of kidney disease; macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 300 mg/g) had the strongest association with increasing blood pressure category (odds ratio: 2. 37 [95 % CI: 2. 00 to 2. 81]).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} benefits of treating hypertension in elderly patients and to derive practical guidelines regarding indications, goals, {{and forms of}} treatment. DESIGN [...] Review of six published randomised trials. RESULTS [...] Active treatment of hypertension in elderly patients was associated with significant improvements in several indices of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly the incidence of fatal and non-fatal strokes. On {{the basis of the}} trial data, combined systolic and diastolic <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a sustained systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg and diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg. There is convincing evidence that efforts should be made to reduce both systolic and diastolic pressures to below these levels in patients up to the age of 80 years. Isolated systolic <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg {{in the presence of a}} diastolic pressure less than 90 mmHg. Two trials reported benefit from the treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in patients up to the age of 80, and further trials are underway to support or refute this recommendation. Diuretics have an established role in the management of hypertension in elderly patients; beta adrenoceptor antagonists have given variable results, and the benefits are less impressive than with diuretic based regimens. Newer agents show promise in the treatment of elderly patients, particularly in the presence of coexisting disease, but their effects on morbidity and mortality have not been evaluated in large randomised trials. CONCLUSIONS [...] Diuretics rather than beta blockers are the treatment of choice for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, but combinations of drugs may be required in as many as 50 % of patients...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: High salt intake through food rich in salt {{is one of}} the {{important}} risk factors for hypertension, and even modest reduction in salt intake lowers the blood pressure (BP). In Croatia 91. 6 % of the total territory is classified as rural and 47. 6 % of population live in rural regions. The study was conducted in order to determine salt intake and awareness on harmful effect of salt on BP, prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension in rural part of Sisak – Moslavina County (SMC), third largest county in Croatia. Materials and Methods: In total there were 107 participants, 50 (46. 7 %) male, and 57 (53. 3 %) female. <b>Hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, and/or current treatment with an antihypertensive medication. Treated <b>hypertension</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the current use of an antihypertensive medication. Salt intake was estimated based on questionnaire results. Results: Prevalence of hypertension was 84 % for male and 77. 2 % for female. Out of 88 hypertensive participants, 76. 7 % were treated, and hypertension of 59. 1 % was uncontrolled. Salt intake was high. 71 % of participants were aware that salt intake is related to hypertension, 70 % did not know main sources of salt intake in every day meal, and only 39. 2 % were advised by health professionals.
