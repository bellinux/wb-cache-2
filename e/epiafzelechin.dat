40|$|<b>Epiafzelechin</b> is a flavan- 3 -ol {{commonly}} found in plant source. Biological studies suggested that (-) <b>epiafzelechin</b> may have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and bone-protective effect. However, it's in vivo efficacy remains to be demonstrated. A specific detection method for (-) -epiafzelechin was successfully developed by using UPLC-MS/MS to quantify the amount of (-) -epiafzelechin present in mice plasma after a liquid-liquid extraction by ethyl acetate. The separation was achieved by using a reversed-phase C 18 column with a 16 min gradient elution protocol consisting of water (0. 1 %, v/v, formic acid) and 0 - 70 % ACN (0. 1 %, v/v, formic acid). The lower limit of quantitation for (-) -epiafzelechin {{was found to be}} 12. 5 ng/mL. This method exhibited a good linearity (r(2) = 0. 992). The intra-day and inter-day precision were within 12 %, while the accuracy was between 97. 6 and 113. 4 %. A quantity of 10 mg/kg synthetic (-) <b>epiafzelechin</b> was administered to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by intravenous (i. v.) and intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections and the blood was collected at different time points. The plasma was then analyzed by the UPLC-MS/MS method, and the plasma drug concentration-time curves for i. v. and i. p. (-) -epiafzelechin injection were constructed. The maximum concentrations (C-max) of (-) -epiafzelechin in blood by i. v. and i. p. injection were found to be 10. 6 and 6. 0 mu g/mL, respectively, while the time for reaching C-max in i. p. injection was found to be 15 min. The distribution half-lives of (-) -epiafzelechin after i. v. and i. p. injection were found to be 7. 0 and 12. 6 min, respectively. Some of the PK parameters were found to be similar in both i. v. and i. p. injections of (-) -epiafzelechin owing to its high solubility in water.

40|$|Hydrolysable and {{condensed}} tannins in {{the fruit}} of Syzygium cumini were identified using NMR, MALDI-TOF MS and HPLC analyses. Hydrolysable tannins were identified as ellagitannins, consisting of a glucose core surrounded by gallic acid and ellagic acid units. Condensed tannins were identified as B-type oligomers of <b>epiafzelechin</b> (propelargonidin) {{with a degree of}} polymerization up to eleven. The antioxidant activity were measured by two vitro models: 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP). Tannins extracted from S. cumini fruit showed a very good DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing/antioxidant power.

In {{the present}} study, a {{phytochemical}} investigation of two medicinal plants, namely, Acridocarpus natalitius and Typha capensis is presented. The roots of A. natalitius afforded {{a variety of}} pentacyclic triterpenoids, namely, friedelin [41], epi-friedelinol [42], lupeol [43] and oleanolic acid [44], including stigmasterol [45] from the hexane extract, whilst the methanolic extract produced a flavonoid, (-) -epicatechin [4] and carbohydrates which included glucose [64] and sucrose [65]. Two new bibenzyls were isolated from the hexane extract of the rhizhomes of T. capensis, namely, typharin [47] and typhaphthalide [48]. β-Sitosterol [49] was also isolated.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} disease characterised by prolonged hyperglycaemia,especially postprandial, {{in association with}} the consumption of diets that promote obesity. While different types of the disease have been identified, Type II diabetes also known as insulin dependent diabetes is most prevalent. Treatment for patients with this disease is usually a combination of exercise, low caloric diet and specific medical intervention through the use of allopathic medicines or surgery. While the number of treatment option is large, unfortunately, treatment is usually associated with complication such as drug adverse reactions and failure to halt disease progression. As a result new therapies are required. Herbal medicines such as those derived from the Ficus species, which have been used traditionally in the treatment of diabetes, may serve as new source of drug therapies. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of selected South African Ficus species for their potential ability to manage Type II diabetes using in vitro and in vivo screening models. Dried and ground leaves of ten Ficus species were extracted separately with acetone, chloroform and hexane for determination of its phytochemical constituents. Since acetone extracted more variety of compounds, the extracts was used for determination of total polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, cytotoxicity, glucose uptake in primary cell cultures and established cell lines, and insulin release in pancreatic cell lines. The most active extract (F. lutea) was subjected to solvent-solvent fractionation and the six fraction subsequently evaluated by the same assays. The most active fraction (ethyl acetate) was hereafter subjected to fractionation for the isolation of bioactive compound(s) or direct evaluation in a mouse obesity model. The acetone extract of F. lutea had the highest polyphenolic content (56. 85 ± 1. 82 mg GAE/g dry weight), the strongest antioxidant activity (4. 80 ± 0. 90 TEAC) and the highest α-amylase inhibitory activity with an EC 50 value of 9. 42 ± 2. 01 μg/ml. Although the extract of F. lutea had the highest sucrase (64. 31 ± 3. 57 %) inhibitory activity at concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml, the ECβ of F. sycomorus (217 ± 69 μg/ml) was the best followed by F. lutea (289 ± 111 μg/ml). Based on the correlation coefficient between polyphenol and alpha amylase inhibition (0. 80) and alpha glucosidase (sucrase) inhibition (0. 84), and the partial non-competitive manner by which the acetone extract of F. lutea inhibited the α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, the polyphenols appear to be in part responsible for the evident activity. All ten Ficus species were less toxic than doxorubicin (positive control) but contained compounds that are generally relatively more toxic to the Vero kidney cells than to the C 3 A liver cells. The extract of F. craterostoma was the least toxic to the C 3 A and Vero cells, while the LCβ for the extract of F. lutea extract were relatively non-toxic to the Vero cells (214. 8 ± 5. 0 μg/ml) and more toxic (126. 0 ± 6. 8 μg/ml) to the C 3 A cell line. In the glucose uptake assays using primary rat abdominal muscle or epididymal fat cells, F. lutea acetone extracts (200 μg/ml) induced greater glucose uptake of 10. 8 ± 1. 8 % for muscle and of 32. 0 ± 8. 4 % for fat respectively, in comparison to the DMSO control wells. A similar response was seen with the established C 2 C 12 muscle and H- 4 -II-E liver cell lines, where F. lutea in a dose related manner increased glucose uptake and at the highest concentration (500 μg/ml) increase glucose uptake by 14. 9 ± 2. 3 % and 19. 3 ± 0. 6 % respectively. In contrast no result was quantifiable in the established 3 T 3 -L 1 pre-adipocytes cell line, most likely due to a flaw in the methodology. The concurrent insulin addition, (1 and 10 μM) also potentiated the glucose utilisation in the F. lutea treated C 2 C 12 and H- 4 -II-E cells. On addition of extracts to the RIN-m 5 F pancreatic β-cells, the extract of F. lutea stimulated a dose related increase in insulin release with insulin secretion of 120. 8 ± 11. 1 % at the highest concentration (500 μg/ml) and concurrent dose related decrease in cell viability in comparison to the untreated control. As a result it would appear that F. lutea acetone extracts have a dual mechanism behind its ability to reduce glucose concentrations. The extract of Ficus lutea, was further subjected to solvent-solvent fractionation in hexane, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water due to its superior response. The ethyl acetate fraction had the highest polyphenolic content (100. 5 ± 1. 6 mg GEA/g dried extract) and the highest sucrase inhibitory activity (126. 8 ± 30. 6 μg/ml), while the n-butanol fraction had the highest α-amylase inhibitory activity (26. 5 ± 1. 3 μg/ml). Nonetheless the inhibition of the α-amylase enzyme activity by the various fractions was in all cases lower than that for the crude extract. In the cytotoxic assay using Vero monkey kidney and C 3 A liver cell line, the hexane fraction was the least toxic while the ethyl acetate fraction was relatively non-toxic, it had the lowest LDβ against the Vero cells (LDβ = 126. 9 ± 1. 5 μg/ml). In the glucose uptake assays, the ethyl acetate fraction stimulated the greatest glucose uptake into the C 2 C 12 muscle and H- 4 -II-E liver cells in dose responsive manner, with no added benefits being achieved through the concurrent addition of insulin. The ethyl acetate fraction also enhanced insulin secretion in RIN-m 5 F pancreatic β-cells, albeit to a lower extent than the crude extract with dose related decrease in cell viability. With the ethyl acetate fraction being the most active fraction with moderately toxicity, further isolation was attempted. Five compounds were isolated, namely lupeol, stigmasterol, α-amyrin acetate, epicatechin and <b>epiafzelechin,</b> with all of the compounds except <b>epiafzelechin</b> previously known to possess antidiabetic activity. The ethyl-acetate fraction was also evaluated for its weight reducing potential in obese mouse model. Unfortunately no in vivo activity was discernible. In conclusion, this study is the first to report on the in vitro antidiabetic activity of the extract of F. lutea [...] Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|In the {{preliminary}} study {{to find new}} and natural sources of antioxidant, tyrosinase inhibition and antibacterial compounds, methanolic extracts from fifteen fern species were investigated. The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteau method and the antioxidant capacities were measured using the DPPH radical scavenging, ferric reducing power (FRP), metal ion chelating power and β–carotene bleaching (BCB) assays. Five fern species that possessed strong DPPH radical scavenging activity, FRP and BCB activity were Blechnum orientale L., Cyathea latebrosa (Wall. Ex. Hook) Copel, Cibotium barometz (L.) J. Sm., Drynaria quercifolia (L.) J. Sm. and Dicranopteris linearis (Burm.) Underwood var. linearis. Strong ion chelating activity was shown by Pteris vittata L. and Pteris venulosa Bl. Moderate tyrosinase inhibition activity was found in B. orientale and C. latebrosa, while antibacterial activities were exhibited by B. orientale, D. linearis and C. barometz. Five solvent extracts of B. orientale (BO) and C. barometz (CB) were prepared by suspending the respective methanolic crude extracts in water and successively extracting with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol. HPLC and LC-MS analyses identified rutin, chlorogenic acid, kaempferol, caffeic acid, apigenin- 7, 4 -diglucoside, luteolin- 7 -rutinoside and luteolin triglycoside in BO, while rutin and esculin were found in CB. Bioactivities investigations showed that the ethyl acetate- (BOeaf), butanol- (BObutf) and water- (BOwatf) soluble extracts possessed strong radical scavenging (IC 50 8. 6 - 13. 0 µg/mL), antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stapylococcus epidermidis (minimum bactericidal concentration MBC 15. 6 - 250 µg/mL) and selective cytotoxic activity against human colon cancer cells HT 29 (IC 50 27. 5 - 42. 9 µg/mL). Tyrosinase inhibition activities were strongest in BOeaf (70 % at 2. 5 mg/mL) and BOwatf (51 %). The water extract (BOwatf) {{was found to be}} safe (i. e. low toxicity) for oral consumption following an oral acute toxicity study. The traditional usage of BO in wound healing was verified in an in vivo study using the water extract, as revealed by the significant wound size reduction, mean epithelisation time and the increased collagen synthesis in the 2 % extract-treated group, compared with those of the vehicle-group. A polymeric proanthocyanidin (condensed tannins) and a flavan- 3 -ol were isolated from the active solvent extracts of BO. Spectroscopic analyses showed that the proanthocyanidin was a heterogeneous polymer possessing epicatechin subunits with 2 - 12 degree of polymerization and co-existing with minor units of <b>epiafzelechin</b> and epigallocatechin at C 4 -C 8 interflavanoid linkages. Bioactivity studies recorded strong radical scavenging activity (IC 50 5. 6 ± 0. 1 µg/mL), bactericidal activity and selective cytotoxicity towards colon cancer cells HT 29 (IC 50 7. 0 ± 0. 3 µg/mL). Further studies were conducted to assess the cytotoxic potential and apoptosis induction effects on HT 29. Cell death was found to be time and dose dependent. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy, FITC-Annexin V staining coupled with flow cytometry, caspase colorimetric assays and western blot analyses. The molecular mechanism underlying the apoptosis in the extract-treated HT 29 cells involved caspases - 3, - 6 and - 8. These results provided the first evidence of the apoptotic induction capability of the proanthocyanidins of B. orientale via an extrinsic-mediated pathway. The flavan- 3 -ol isolated was characterized as 4 β-carboxymethyl-(-) -epicatechin which possessed antioxidant potential (IC 50 14. 66 ± 0. 29 µM) comparable to that of ascorbic acid. The overall results indicate the promising potential of the proanthocyanidins of B. orientale as a natural therapeutic source to treat oxidative related medical health problems, for the chemotherapy of colon cancer and a source of bactericidal agent...|$|E
