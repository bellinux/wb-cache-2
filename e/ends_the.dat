5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both <b>ends,</b> <b>the</b> larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end.

This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly larvae.|$|E
