5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying <b>is</b> <b>where</b> players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot <b>is</b> <b>where</b> a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot <b>is</b> <b>where</b> a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E

The procedure division contains the program's statements. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which {{are made up of}} paragraphs.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving environment <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the diver {{enters a}} space from {{which there is}} no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
