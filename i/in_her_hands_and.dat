5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} {{the iconography of}} Vishnu. While the lotus and shankha are held in the upper hands, the lower hands rest on two dwarf figures: the personified gada and chakra. The gada personified as a slim-waisted woman, holds a chamara (chowry) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head; chakra stands as a man on Vishnu's left. The personified weapons known as Ayudhapurusha emerge in Gupta era (320–550 CE) sculptures. The personified Kaumodaki {{is also known as}} Gada-devi (the suffix devi means goddess) or Gada-nari ("gada-woman"). Since the Sanskrit word gada is feminine, gada is regarded as a woman. A Gupta Vishnu in Udayagiri Caves depicts Vishnu accompanied by Gadadevi and the personified chakra. Gadadevi often appears in Vishnu images from Kashmir, including Vishnu's four-headed form Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. She holds a chamara and looks in adoration towards her master, whose hand rests on her head. She wears a crown or has an elaborate hairstyle. Apart from a lower garment, she might wear a blouse or have a bare torso. She is depicted emerging from the gada.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is a fearful black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, Roberts said that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> that she would wait for him to contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was too nervous to listen to it immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E
500|$|The first {{performance}} of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] {{was on the}} Hard Candy Promo Tour of 2008; Madonna, wearing a skintight black suit and a lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne [...] with a golden walking stick, as {{the music of the}} song started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking the back of the stage as Madonna and [...] her six dancers gyrated in choreographed dance moves. That same year, the song was performed as the opening number of the Sticky & Sweet Tour. Similar to the promo tour, Madonna appeared on a M-shaped throne dressed in a Givenchy-designed dress, sitting with her legs spread apart and holding a staff <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> was accompanied by dancers in bondage themed costumes, while the backdrop screens depicted images of gumdrops and candies. For the 2009 extension of the tour, the backdrop video for [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was replaced by a new one by artist Marilyn Minter, featuring imagery of a giant tongue licking and spitting out neon-colored icing. Madonna also wore new opening outfit designed by Riccardo Tisci. The live {{performance of}} the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E
500|$|Although winds in New Hampshire, {{along the}} hurricane's {{northern}} edge, were less severe, higher snowfall totals were recorded. In Portsmouth, damage was minimal and mainly confined to fences. On 10October, thundersnow {{was observed in}} Walpole as precipitation changed due to sinking temperatures, which soon followed by a period of high winds. Though the average snowfall amount in the Connecticut River Valley {{was estimated to be}} near , much of it quickly melted, leaving only [...] left by the snowstorm's departure. Still, the heavy weight of the unusually early wet snow snapped many tree branches still in full bloom, ruining fruit orchards and sugar groves. As a result, production of cider, already in low supply, was reduced even further; damages to one orchard alone reached $300 (1804USD). Due to snow-obstructed roads, post was delivered on horseback, and at Gilsum, the hurricane was so intense that a group of men traveling toward Keene were forced to return due to blocked roads smothered with over [...] of snow. The timber industry suffered the blizzard's detrimental effects, the worst blow to the trade since its formation in New Hampshire; in addition, several barns were obliterated. Totals reached [...] at Hanover, [...] at Goffstown, and over [...] in the Green Mountains; meanwhile, in southern portions of the state, [...] of ice accrued upon the accumulations already on the ground. The storm's damage radius was estimated to be at least , and encompassed the towns of Peterborough, Rindge, Lyme, and Amherst, each received [...] of frozen precipitation. At Rye Beach, a woman, swept to sea on a stranded ship, was found dead with an infant <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> the Amity was also wrecked along its shores, causing an additional death.|$|E

500|$|The {{video of}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was {{considered}} to be a sequel to the one for the previous clip on the album, [...] "Partition". It opens with Beyoncé watching a man while he is sitting on a table in front of her, reading a newspaper. She stands up and the scene transitions to the singer walking down the stairs in a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As she waits for him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up. Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding a drink <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> straddling a pinball machine. As the song nears its end, sped-up scenes of a car driving on different streets follows. During the end, Beyoncé runs to a man who is seen only from the back, dressed in a hooded coat. She embraces him with teary eyes, sighing with relief. Throughout the video, close-up shots of the singer are also featured, showing her expressions. Beyoncé is seen wearing a high-waist corset and a cropped lace top designed by Ulyana Sergeenko with her look being complete with an earring. She also wears a studded plate cuff, a chain, and a gold bracelet from jewelry by Eddie Borgo. During scenes at the party, she wears a sweatshirt designed by Givenchy.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 23 April 1943, Good Friday, Valtorta {{reported}} a voice suddenly speaking to her and asking her to write.

2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the orb is akin to the globus-cruciger theory. While such an object {{may not have been}} part of the coronation ceremony of the Holy Roman Empire until the next century, the idea of an orb symbolizing power over the Mundus, i.e. the world, was well known by the time the sculpture was crafted. Depictions of this symbol of power can be found in Carolingian and Ottonian illuminated manuscripts. [...] According to this theory then, Mary is holding the whole world <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> she is holding it on behalf of the one who is in fact its sovereign, i.e. the infant in her lap.|$|E
2500|$|In response, British Prime Minister Tony Blair {{and members}} of Parliament {{publicly}} endorsed Williams's arguments. Later that year, the Women's Tennis Association and UNESCO teamed for a campaign to promote gender equality in sports, asking Williams to lead the campaign. Under enormous pressure, Wimbledon announced in February 2007 that it would award equal prize money to all competitors in all rounds, and the French Open followed suit a day later. In the aftermath, the Chicago Sun-Times cited Williams as [...] "the single factor" [...] that [...] "changed {{the minds of the}} boys" [...] and a leader whose [...] "willingness to take a public stand separates her not only from most of her female peers, but also from our most celebrated male athletes." [...] Williams herself commented, [...] "Somewhere in the world a little girl is dreaming of holding a giant trophy <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> being viewed as an equal to boys who have similar dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ultima [...] – An elderly curandera, {{known in}} the Márez {{household}} as [...] "La Grande" [...] is {{the embodiment of the}} wisdom of her ancestors and carries within her the powers to heal, to confront evil, to use the power of nature and to understand the relationship between the seen and unseen. Her role in the community is as mediator. [...] "She preserves the indispensable contact with the world of nature and the supernatural forces inhabiting this universe (255)." [...] She is the spiritual guide for Antonio as he journeys through childhood. Ultima knows the ways of the Catholic Church and also the ways of the indigenous spiritual practices over which she is master. Ultima understands the philosophy and the morality of the ancient peoples of New Mexico and teaches Tony through example, experience and critical reflection, the universal principles that explain and sustain life. Although she is generally respected in the community, people sometimes misunderstand her power. At times she is referred to as a bruja, or witch, but no one—not even Antonio—knows whether or not she is truly a witch. Finally Antonio puts pieces of the puzzle together and the revelation of who she is comes to him. She holds Antonio's destiny <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the end of the}} story sacrifices her own life so that Antonio might live.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the reading}} {{continues}} in chapter [...] having borne no children after 10 years in Canaan, Sarai bade Abram to consort with her Egyptian maidservant Hagar, so that Sarai {{might have a}} son through her, and Abram did as Sarai requested. When Hagar saw that she had conceived, Sarai was lowered in her esteem, and Sarai complained to Abram. Abram told Sarai that her maid was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> Sarai treated her harshly, so Hagar ran away. An angel of God found Hagar by a spring {{of water in the}} wilderness, and asked her where she came from and where she was going, and she replied that she was running away from her mistress. The angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for God would make Hagar's offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name Ishmael, for God had paid heed to her suffering. Ishmael would be a wild donkey of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone's hand against him, but he would dwell alongside his kinsmen. Hagar called God [...] "El-roi," [...] meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her, and the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. And when Abram was 86 years old, Hagar bore him a son, and Abram gave him the name Ishmael. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here with the end of chapter ...|$|E
