5|$|Chicago entered week sixteen with {{a chance}} to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost. The Packers and Lions {{eventually}} lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting the Bears in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles. The last game between the Bears and Eagles was in 2011, when the Bears won 30â24; the Bears also lead the all-time series 30â12â1, though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings. However, the Bears had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; the Bears had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense also must contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>passing</b> game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense.
