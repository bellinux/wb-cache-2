5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an <b>end</b> <b>point</b> and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|LocoRoco {{is divided}} into 5 worlds each {{consisting}} of 8 levels. In each level, {{the goal is to}} reach the <b>end</b> <b>point</b> of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first yellow one (Kulche), the rest are unlocked as the player completes the levels. The player can then opt which LocoRoco they want to use for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as blobs of gelatin, deforming from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.|$|E
40|$|Background: Using {{surrogate}} <b>end</b> <b>points</b> {{for overall}} survival, such as disease-free survival, is increasingly common in randomized controlled trials.

The estimation of treatment effects may be directly affected by the definitions of <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> The DATECAN initiative (Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-event Endpoints in CANcer trials) aims to provide recommendations for definitions of TTE <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> We report guidelines for randomized cancer clinical trials (RCTs) in breast cancer.

5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific <b>end</b> <b>point</b> to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E

Arteriosclerotic New Zealand white rabbits (N = 15) were studied. A thoraco-abdominal exploration was performed, the aorta was isolated, heparin was administered, and multiple endarterectomies were performed in each rabbit. A line of laser craters was created at the proximal and distal ends of an atheroma. Laser radiation was used 10 connect the craters {{to form the}} proximal and distal <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> The atheromas were dissected from the aorta with laser light and the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were fused. The aortas were removed for light and electron microscopy and the animals were sacrificed. Excimer radiation was delivered by a 600 -pm fiber at 50 rnJ/pulse, 120 -ns pulses and either 15 -or 20 -Hz frequency. At 15 Hz excimer laser endarterectomies showed no perforations along the surface or at the <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> The surfaces were smooth but the <b>end</b> <b>points</b> were not welded in place. At 20 Hz, perforations were seen along 7 / 11 surfaces and at 5 / 11 <b>end</b> <b>points.</b> Excimer laser endarterectomy is best performed at 15 Hz.
