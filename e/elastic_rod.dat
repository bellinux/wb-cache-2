50|$|In 2014 {{a concept}} of hybrid scale has been introduced, the elastically {{deformable}} arm scale, which is a combination between a spring scale and a beam balance, exploiting simultaneously both principles of equilibrium and deformation. In this scale, the rigid arms of a classical beam balance (for example a steelyard) are replaced with a flexible <b>elastic</b> <b>rod</b> in an inclined frictionless sliding sleeve. The rod can reach a unique free of sliding equilibrium when two vertical dead loads (or masses) are applied at its edges. Equilibrium, which would be impossible with rigid arms, is guaranteed because configurational forces develop at the two edges of the sleeve {{as a consequence of}} both the free sliding condition and the nonlinear kinematics of the <b>elastic</b> <b>rod.</b> This weight measuring device can also work without a counterweight.|$|E
40|$|Mechanics is a {{fascinating}} field of physics. Its main purpose is to study the interaction of particles {{in the presence of}} forces such as gravity. In contrast to the dynamics of particles, the study of continuous media, such as elastic bodies, is challenging and still today not entirely well-understood. This {{is due to the fact}} that continuous media behave in numerous and complex ways. For example it is difficult to describe mathematically the twisting and bending of <b>elastic</b> <b>rods</b> but approximate models do exist. The study of the dynamics of <b>elastic</b> <b>rods</b> is a field of research that is interesting in it-self because it gives rise to beautiful and complex mathematical structures.

40|$|Long length-scale {{structural}} deformations of DNA {{play a central}} role in many biological processes including gene expression. The <b>elastic</b> <b>rod</b> model, which uses a continuum approximation, has emerged as a viable tool to model deformations of DNA molecules. The <b>elastic</b> <b>rod</b> model predictions are however very sensitive to the constitutive law (material properties) of the molecule, which in turn, vary along the molecules length according to its base-pair sequence. Identification of the nonlinear sequence-dependent constitutive law from experimental data and feasible molecular dynamics simulations remains a significant challenge.
