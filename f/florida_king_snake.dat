50|$|Frank Nelson Blanchard (December 19, 1888 - September 21, 1937) was an American herpetologist, and {{professor}} of zoology at the University of Michigan from which institution he received his Ph.D. He is credited with describing several new subspecies, including the broad-banded water snake, Nerodia fasciata confluens, and the <b>Florida</b> <b>king</b> <b>snake,</b> Lampropeltis getula floridana. As well, he has been honored by having reptiles and amphibians named after him, including the western smooth green snake, Opheodrys vernalis blanchardi, and Blanchard's cricket frog, Acris crepitans blanchardi.|$|E

[...] It is also found on the narrow plains of northwestern Michoacán and on the Tres Marias Islands. The range of this snake appears to be tied to the proximity of watercourses, including ones utilized for irrigation and agriculture. It is a subspecies of the milksnake, Lampropeltis triangulum. It is similar in size to other <b>king</b> <b>snakes,</b> averaging 42 in long, and like them, is nonvenomous.|$|R

50|$|The Colubrinae are a {{subfamily}} of the Colubridae {{family of}} snakes. It includes numerous genera, and taxonomic sources often {{disagree on the}} exact number.

5000|$|Pantherophis guttatus was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} genus Elaphe, but Elaphe {{was found to be}} paraphyletic by Utiger et al., leading to placement of this species in the genus Pantherophis. The placement of Pantherophis guttatus and several related species in Pantherophis rather than Elaphe has been confirmed by further phylogenetic studies. Many reference materials still use the synonym Elaphe guttata. Molecular data has shown that corn snakes are actually more closely related to <b>king</b> <b>snakes</b> (genus Lampropeltis) than they are to the Old World rat snakes with which they were formerly classified. Corn snakes have even been bred in captivity with California <b>king</b> <b>snakes</b> to produce fertile hybrids known as [...] "Jungle corn snakes".|$|R

The movie was a comparatively tame film, adapted from an old folk tale and not displaying the characteristic elements of the later, post-2003, horror films. The popularity of The <b>Snake</b> <b>King's</b> Child inspired a sequel, The <b>Snake</b> <b>King's</b> Grandchild, which involved a ghost story based on the mythology of the ap (Thai: krasue) legend.|$|R
50|$|Although Pantherophis was {{originally}} proposed in 1843, {{in more recent}} history these species {{were placed in the}} genus Elaphe. In 2002 Utiger et al. raised a taxonomic suggestion to resurrect the genus Pantherophis based on mitochondrial DNA evidence suggesting the New World ratsnakes are more closely related to <b>king</b> <b>snakes</b> than to the Old World ratsnakes. This was confirmed by later phylogenetic studies.|$|R
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon blowout {{occurred}} on April 20 th, 2010, releasing 4. 9 {{million barrels of}} Louisiana crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Subsequent to the Deepwater Horizon blowout, sediment cores revealed oil on the northern GoM seafloor and abnormal skin lesions were seen in GoM fishes. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a component of crude oil, in fish {{has been associated with}} many sublethal effects, including cancer and population-level effects. Using a biomarker of exposure to PAHs, this thesis evaluates inter-species, temporal and spatial differences in exposure to hydrocarbon contamination between three species of fish with varying levels of association with the sediment, that were potentially exposed to Deepwater Horizon crude oil: golden tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), <b>king</b> <b>snake</b> eel (Ophichthus rex) and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and examines patterns in these data using life history, behavior and environmental data. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, bile samples and biometric data were collected from fish via demersal longlining and bile was analyzed for three PAHs, naphthalene, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene and their metabolites, using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-F). Bile of golden tilefish had significantly higher concentrations of naphthalene and phenanthrene metabolites, compared to red snapper and <b>king</b> <b>snake</b> eel. For biliary naphthalene metabolites, golden tilefish had an average concentration of 240 ug g- 1, compared to 61 ug g- 1 for red snapper and 38 ug g- 1 for <b>king</b> <b>snake</b> eel, for the year 2012. Biliary naphthalene metabolite concentration has decreased 8...|$|R

50|$|The Sinaloan {{milk snake}} mates from early May to late June, {{sometimes}} twice a year. The brumation period is between November to February.

Like {{other members of the}} <b>king</b> <b>snake</b> family, the Sinaloan milk snake sometimes eats other snakes, and does have at least some immunity to their venom.|$|R

Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and mentally immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns.|$|R
