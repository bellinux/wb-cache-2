These {{can alter the}} liner's performance by causing scattering between mode orders, usually {{to the detriment of}} overall attenuation. Three-dimensional finite element methods, often involving specialised codes, have previously been used to predict the performance of such spliced liners. Here, an alternative approach is presented which uses a readily available two-dimensional finite element solver to find the modes of the spliced liner and then matches them to the analytical modes of the hard duct. The results are compared with three-dimensional finite element calculations to verify their accuracy. The method as described is for ducts with no flow, but can be extended to flow ducts if necessary...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{one-third of}} all {{fatalities}} and one-sixth of all seriously injured are the consequence of run-off-road crashes. The outcome of run-off-road crashes is relatively severe, one fatality in five seriously injured, which is twice the average in the Netherlands. Serious run-off-road crashes often occur in bends, and the majority is registered on 80 km/h roads. Measures to prevent run-off-road crashes are a correct and predictable road layout, and a forgiving layout with rumble <b>strips,</b> <b>hard</b> <b>strips</b> and semi-hardened road shoulders. With respect to vehicles, Electronic Stability Control (ESC) {{turns out to be}} quite effective. If vehicles do end up on the shoulder, sufficiently wide obstacle-free zones should prevent a collision with obstacles. If this is not feasible, the obstacles should be shielded. Audits and inspections, giving safety scores to provincial roads and shoulders and developing crash models for this type of road should help select and prioritize measures, also with respect to forgiving shoulders...|$|R

40|$|The iron {{stripping}} from di(- 2 -ethylhexyl) {{phosphoric acid}} (D 2 EHPA) constitutes {{a problem in}} hydrometallurgical processes: whereas Fe(III) is easily extracted along with other elements such as zinc or cadmium, it is <b>hard</b> to <b>strip</b> it from the organic phase. It {{is well known that}} Fe(II) is readily stripped from D 2 EHPA, so a reduction of ferric to ferrous iron could be a way to solve this problem. In this work, the reductive stripping in vacuum of Fe(III) from D 2 EHPA has been studied by using SHG zinc powder as a reducing agent. The optimisation of operating conditions, such as degree of vacuum, acid concentration and quantity of added zinc, has been made. The experiments showed that a stripping yield greater than 89 % in only one stage can be achieved, depending on A/O ratio, at 80 kPa of pressure. The iron reduction and stripping have been done simultaneously. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. Ail rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|For cultured large yellow croakers, hormone {{stimulation}} {{is necessary}} to induce final oocyte maturation and synchronize the ovulation. LHRHA 3 (a GnRH analogue) can have a stimulating effect on pituitary gonadotrophs and consequently increase the secretion of gonadotropins. In trial 1, LHRHA 3 was injected once, but there were still 30 % poorly matured females whose eggs were <b>hard</b> to <b>strip,</b> and the fertilization rate was low. In trial 2, using double injections, the poorly matured females decreased to 10 %, and the fertilization rate increased significantly. The hatching rate was also improved, although not significantly. The first injection was done to promote maturation of the eggs and the second one was to induce the release of eggs from the ovary (Shan Jian 1985). For Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), a repeated GnRHa injection protocol was also more effective than a single injection for stimulating egg production by stripping, without compromising egg quality (Rasines et al. 2012). Double injections with LHRHA 3 are thus recommended for large yellow croaker, especially for the less matured parent fish, where it can substantially accelerate the maturation of the eggs. The hatching rate could be affected partly by herterosis effect from crossing of two strains in trial 2.|$|R
