5|$|A {{number of}} notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, {{one of the}} {{founding}} fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an <b>EU</b> <b>institution,</b> a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of the Solidarity movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.|$|E
5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or <b>EU</b> <b>institution,</b> in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|The European Council officially {{gained the}} status of an <b>EU</b> <b>institution</b> after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, {{distinct}} from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits {{of the leaders of}} the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the European Political Cooperation) taking integration beyond economics.|$|E

500|$|Most MEPs prefer Brussels as {{a single}} base. A poll of MEPs found 89% of the {{respondents}} wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels. Another, more academic, survey found 68% support. In July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs voted in favour of a single seat. In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week. The mayor of Strasbourg officially reacted by stating [...] "we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a judoka would do." [...] However, as Parliament's seat is now fixed by the treaties, {{it can only be}} changed by the Council acting unanimously, meaning that France could veto any move. The former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has stated that the Strasbourg seat is [...] "non-negotiable", and that France has no intention of surrendering the only <b>EU</b> <b>Institution</b> on French soil. [...] Given France's declared intention to veto any relocation to Brussels, some MEPs have advocated civil disobedience by refusing {{to take part in the}} monthly exodus to Strasbourg.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{preliminary}} rulings on {{the proper}} interpretation of EU law, an essential function of the Court of Justice is judicial review of the acts of the EU itself. Under TFEU article 263(1) the Court can review the legality of any EU legislative of other [...] "act" [...] against the Treaties or general principles, {{such as those in}} the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This includes legislation, and most other acts that have legal consequences for people. For example, in Société anonyme Cimenteries CBR Cementsbedrijven NV v Commission the Commission made a decision to withdraw an assurance to a Dutch cement company that it would be immune from competition law fines, for vertical agreements. The cement company challenged the decision, and the Commission argued this was not really an [...] "act", and so could not be challenged. The Court of Justice held a challenge could be made, and it was an act, because it [...] "deprived [...] of the advantages of a legal situation... and exposed them to a grave financial risk". Similarly in Deutsche Post v Commission the Commission demanded information on state aid given by Germany to Deutsche Post within 20 days. When both challenged this, the Commission argued that the demand for information could not be an act as there was no sanction. The Court of Justice disagreed, and held judicial review could proceed because the request produced [...] "binding legal effects" [...] since the information supplied or not could be relied upon as evidence in a final decision. By contrast, in IBM v Commission the Court of Justice held that a letter from the Commission to IBM that it would sue IBM for abusing a dominant position contrary to competition was not a reviewable act, but just a preliminary statement of intent to act. In any case, if a reviewable act of an <b>EU</b> <b>institution</b> is not found compatible with the law, under article 264, it will be declared void.|$|E

40|$|High degree {{conflict}} of interest of the EU member states and efforts of the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> to increase their influential power in decision making, makes the process of allocation {{of power in the}} EU extremely complex process which is under permanent modifications and changes. Relations between the normative and political system in EU does not always lead to zero result in the strengthening of the European Community that necessarily leads to a proportional weakening position of the member states and "vice-versa". Balancing the system of political decision making and normative regulation makes paradigm of allocation of power in the EU ambiguous and challenging, that is under permanent strong scholar’s criticism. For understanding institutionalized balancing between the political and normative system in the EU, is important to consider voting power balance within the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions,</b> interactive relationship between the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions,</b> and communications between <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> and national <b>institutions</b> of the <b>EU</b> member states, as well. These processes create the complex relationship between the powerful bureaucracy of the EU, which is developing in the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions,</b> and political elites of EU member states.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role and significance of the fundamental right of access to justice in the EU (Article 47 CFREU) {{in the context of}} the fragmentation of EU law, as evidenced in the area of civil procedure law. As member states’ procedural regimes are considerably divergent, <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> intervene, more and more often, to ensure EU law is effectively enforced in an equivalent manner across the EU. This work thus addresses a preliminary question: when should <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> provide civil procedure rules that promote effective dispute resolution and enforcement of EU law? In other words, which are the policy parameters that render such a proactive stance on the part of the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> both desirable and feasible? <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> will have to answer this question for every legislative proposal in the area of civil justice. Therefore, this article only offers the broad lines along which such in concreto justification for legislative action in civil justice will have to take place. It is argued that <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> should take into account the various cultural, economic, social, and historical implications of civil procedure law in order to achieve a coherent approach. Against this background, the fundamental right to effective remedy and fair trial should tie all policy parameters together...|$|R
