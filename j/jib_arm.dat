2500|$|In Nashville, Altman used sets with {{noticeable}} {{colors of}} reds, whites and blues. For The Long Goodbye, {{he insisted that}} Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects. Zsigmond states that Altman [...] "wanted to do something different" [...] in this film, {{and told him he}} [...] "wanted the camera to move—all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side." [...] Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, [...] "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working." ...|$|E
50|$|A camera jib or <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> in {{cinematography}} {{is a small}} crane {{that holds}} nothing but the camera.|$|E
5000|$|The opening montage {{ends with}} a {{computer}} generated version of the Doodlebops play room. In season one a <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> was used for a real shot of the room.|$|E
5000|$|Jib: the <b>jib,</b> or {{operating}} <b>arm,</b> extends horizontally {{from the}} crane. A [...] "luffing" [...] jib {{is able to}} move up and down; a fixed jib has a rolling trolley that runs along the underside to move goods horizontally.|$|R
50|$|Tower cranes are {{a modern}} form of balance crane that consist {{of the same}} basic parts. Fixed to the ground on a {{concrete}} slab (and sometimes attached {{to the sides of}} structures), tower cranes often give the best combination of height and lifting capacity and are used in the construction of tall buildings. The base is then attached to the mast which gives the crane its height. Further, the mast is attached to the slewing unit (gear and motor) that allows the crane to rotate. On top of the slewing unit there are three main parts which are: the long horizontal <b>jib</b> (working <b>arm),</b> shorter counter-jib, and the operator's cab.|$|R
500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this big jump, but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on <b>jib</b> <b>arms,</b> dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|R
50|$|A jib is {{somewhat}} {{more complicated than}} a simple lever, since almost always the camera's aim needs to be controlled independently of the swing of the <b>jib</b> <b>arm.</b> This {{can be done by}} relatively simple mechanical means or by the use of remotely controlled electric servo motors.|$|E
50|$|The camera dolly {{may be used}} as a {{shooting}} platform on any surface but is often raised onto a track, to create smooth movement on a horizontal axis known as a tracking shot. Additionally, most professional film studio dollies have a hydraulic <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> that raises or lowers the camera on the vertical axis. When a dolly grip operates a dolly on perpendicular axes simultaneously, it's known as a compound move.|$|E

That property has been published on and off for approximately 40 years. He has also written and illustrated children's books, syndicated newspaper features, greeting cards, for advertising, promotional videos and for television. He designed and manufactures the ComelyCrane; a portable, extendable <b>jib</b> <b>arm.</b> Richard still teaches art classes and is very involved in his community.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The study involves: 1) {{formation}} of an array of geometry, weight and variable data for the automated synthesis of articulated jib systems; 2) development of methodology of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the articulated jib systems, depending on the main technical parameters of the portal crane (maximum and minimum working radius, cargo lift height, tail radius value, carrying capacity of crane); 3) conducting {{of the study of}} the methodology adequacy on computer portal crane models. Methodology. To determine the kinematic characteristics of each link of the articulated <b>jib</b> system (boom, <b>arm,</b> <b>jib</b> tie, counterweight, load) we developed a dynamic and mathematical models that allow us to describe the movement of the articulated jib system when luffing. For the first time the technique of calculation and determination of rational design parameters of the articulated jib systems depending on the technical parameters of the portal crane. Findings. The conducted mathematical modeling allowed scientifically proving the usefulness of the proposed methodology for determining the design parameters of the articulated jib systems. The designed package of geometry, weight and variable data helps to simplify the process of preparatory calculations before the automated synthesis and to optimize the design of the articulated jib systems of portal cranes. Originality. For the first time the work proposes the technique for calculation of the parametric data that allow us to determine the rational design parameters of the articulated jib system. There are developed local programs for the integrated optimization synthesis that make it possible to select the best design option simultaneously by several quality criteria and functional constraints. Practical value. The proposed method of calculating the design parameters can be used in the design of new and modernization of existing portal cranes with the articulated jib systems, which, in turn, will reduce the material and energy consumption of the cranes...|$|R
500|$|Lima Locomotive started {{production}} of the vehicles in June 1943, with five M32B2s and 46 M32B3s. Pressed Steel Car produced 163 M32s and 475 M32B1s in 1944. They also produced 298 M32B3s. Baldwin Locomotive produced 195 M32B1s, while 398 M32B1s were produced by Federal Machine {{before the end of}} 1944. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, used to pull heavy artillery. The M32s were used after 1944 during Operation Overlord and subsequent battles in the European Theater of Operations. It was also used during the Korean War. It was phased out after the introduction of the M74 Tank Recovery Vehicle in 1954, when heavier tanks were produced, such as the M46 Patton. The M32 had a [...] winch, [...] boom, and an A-frame <b>jib.</b> It was <b>armed</b> with two machine guns and a mortar mainly to provide cover for an emergency retreat.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} types of harbor cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbors typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> and roof rotating. Interestingly, dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued {{to rely on the}} more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Technocrane is a {{telescopic}} crane {{that is used}} in {{the film}} industry and in television production, currently manufactured and designed in Poland by Peter Adamietz. There are many different sizes available, from 15 ft to 100 ft. The camera is mounted on the remote head {{on the end of the}} crane and is moved by a camera operator at a control desk. The Technocrane can telescope at different speeds controlled by the operator. It allows camera moves that cannot be achieved using a <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> and dolly, and the telescoping can be used to compensate for the camera moving in an arc.|$|E
5000|$|..... We used an offset <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> with {{a remote}} head, {{so that you}} could get these very precise moves.As soon as you set up a dolly, you're {{changing}} the orchestration of the shot. Your actors have a movement that you don't want to affect or impact. Then you've got a dolly grip moving a thing. You've got another dolly grip who's on the boom arm, making it go up and down and side to side. Then you've got your camerawho's off on these focus wheels, that are off of the dolly." [...] — Jeff Nichols, on the inculcation of Roger Deakins' cinematographic approach in No Country for Old Men (2007), for Loving. Director Jeff Nichols said that influences, such as his thoughts on his own marriage, allowed him the ability to convey the commitment that the Lovings had to one another, with Nichols stating, [...] "It's about how you stay committed through hard times, harrowing times, like for the Lovings, but also mundane times and the daily parts of life. When I look at my own marriage, that’s where the love is. That's where the real work is." [...] Nichols spoke of influences No Country For Old Men (2007) afforded to him, such as giving him an answer to a question relating to a dolly, by which cinematographer Adam Stone and key grip Rocky Ford used a great rig accompanied with a <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> and a remote head: an approach used by Roger Deakins.|$|E
50|$|Titan was {{fabricated}} in the United Kingdom during World War I by Cowans, Sheldon & Company of Carlisle, then {{transported to}} Australia in parts for assembly at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Sydney. Ordered on 5 October 1916, construction at Cockatoo commenced on 7 March 1917. The crane was launched on 5 December 1917. However, during construction, the 40-ton lead screws for the crane's <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> were lost when the merchant ship Afric was torpedoed. The crane {{could be used}} in a limited capability, although it was not until 1919 that replacement screws of sufficient quality were acquired. Titan was completed on 3 December 1919. On completion, the crane was handed over to the RAN.|$|E
50|$|Stationary {{harbour cranes}} are {{considered}} a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244. The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> and roof rotating. These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like see-saws, winches and yards. Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.|$|E

5000|$|Ballard {{is also an}} innovator, {{inventing a}} special camera crane for filming inside {{operating}} rooms {{as part of his}} 30 years of work with Medtronic, filming surgeries used to educate individuals in the medical profession. The crane he developed allows surgeons to teach as they are operating on the patient without the filming process obstructing the view or surgical work in any way. In the early 1980s, Ballard also helped design, build and manufacture The Barber Baby Boom, a 100% mechanical <b>jib</b> <b>arm</b> that was {{the first of its kind}} in the industry. Additionally, Ballard designed a movable jib base specifically to address the challenges of filming on construction locations for ABC's [...] "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition." [...] Engineered with special tires so the jib base can be moved from location to location and he later went on to develop a motorized version of the jib base to make set-up and movement even easier that has been used in recent seasons of the program.|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as the}} Panavision XL2 with G Series {{anamorphic}} lenses, Stone {{employed the}} usage of a J.L. Fisher 10 dolly, a J.L. Fisher 23 <b>jib</b> <b>arm,</b> and a Mo-Sys Hot Head to put the film camera right over the actors as they moved about, {{in order to get}} closer to the actors. Stone remarked that, [...] "It took a little adjusting to but over time we got pretty proficient shooting predominantly with that configuration." [...] He later explained, [...] "We had to improvise when we got into smaller areas where we couldn't easily operate the camera but the overall effect was being just that much closer to the actors Negga and Edgerton and their performances." [...] Stone wished for the camera to be moved, however, not wanting it to be Steadicam, as to be more online with the character. He explains that: [...] "If an actor’s moving at camera, we wanted to be straight on or slightly off axis. We used a dolly with a boom and a hothead for more stability." ...|$|E
