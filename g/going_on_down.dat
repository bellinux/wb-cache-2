2500|$|Thompson then {{flew over}} an {{irrigation}} ditch filled {{with dozens of}} bodies. [...] Shocked at the sight, he radioed his accompanying gunships, knowing his transmission would be monitored by many on the net: [...] "It {{looks to me like}} there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> there. Something ain't right about this. [...] There's bodies everywhere. [...] There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. [...] There's something wrong here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} execution, Thompson {{discovered}} the irrigation ditch full of Calley's victims. Thompson then radioed {{a message to}} accompanying gunships and Task Force Barker headquarters, [...] "It {{looks to me like}} there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here." [...] Thompson spotted movement in the irrigation ditch, indicating that there were civilians alive in it. He immediately landed to assist the victims. Lieutenant Calley approached Thompson and the two exchanged an uneasy conversation.|$|E
2500|$|Starhunter is {{an alien}} tribe that steals all life energy on other planets, {{gathering}} the {{energy in the}} sixth dimension using [...] "King Medal" [...] and bringing it under their control. Soon they created [...] "Knight Medal" [...] when [...] "King Medal" [...] {{was not able to}} absorb all the energy. Hoping to conquer the Earth in one fell swoop, since they believed it would not offer much resistance, they brought along both medals. Fortunately, the ship carrying both medals got hit by crossfire in a war that was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> on Earth. The medals were lost as the ship exploded in Siberia. Starhunter was forced to retreat and create new medals.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{lawyers are}} very much abused now-a-days," [...] said Mr. Furnival, {{thinking}} of what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> at Birmingham at that very moment; [...] "but I hardly know how the world would get on without us." ...|$|E

6000|$|Uncle Chris found Freddie {{in one of}} {{the upper}} boxes, talking to Nelly Bryant. Dancing was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> on the stage, but Freddie, though {{normally}} a young man who shook a skilful shoe, was in no mood for dancing to-night. The return to the scenes of his former triumphs and the meeting with the companions of happier days, severed from him by a two-weeks' notice, had affected Freddie powerfully. Eyeing the happy throng below, he experienced the emotions of that Peri who, in the poem, [...] "at the gate of Eden stood disconsolate." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{noise is}} that? What's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> there?" [...] cried a deep bass {{voice in the}} distance. It was my father. No one replied. Presently my father's bedroom bell rang with extreme violence. Edwards rushed out of the butler's room. The butler fell back, opened his mouth, and pretended to be asleep--snoring moderately. This of itself would have undeceived any one, for when the old hypocrite was really asleep he never snored moderately. The cook and housemaid uttered two little shrieks and slammed their {{respective}} doors, while the bell rang violently a second time.|$|E
60|$|Ol' Mistah Buzzard, sailing {{round and}} round, {{way up in}} the blue, blue sky, could see {{everything}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> below. He could see Reddy Fox running {{along the edge of the}} Green Forest and every few minutes stopping to chuckle and listen to Bowser the Hound trying to pick out the trail Reddy had made so hard to follow by his twists and turns. And he saw something else, did Ol' Mistah Buzzard. It looked to him very much like the barrel of a gun sticking out from behind an old tree just ahead of Reddy.|$|E

No matter where he sit, he can't hear what being said down inside that lil ol' tumble-down house. Then what do yo' think Mistah Buzzard do?

6000|$|I dreamed {{one night}} that Stephen Massett died, And for {{admission}} up at Heaven applied. [...] "Who are you?" [...] asked St. Peter. Massett said: [...] "Jeems Pipes, of Pipesville." [...] Peter bowed his head, Opened the gates and said: [...] "I'm {{glad to know}} you, And wish we'd something better, sir, to show you." [...] "Don't mention it," [...] said Stephen, looking bland, And was about to enter, hat in hand, When from a cloud below such fumes arose As tickled tenderly his conscious nose. He paused, replaced his hat upon his head, Turned back and to the saintly warden said, O'er his already sprouting wings: [...] "I swear I smell some broiling <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> there!" [...] So Massett's paunch, attracted by the smell, Followed his nose and found a place in Hell.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the lowest point of the cliff, the party were halted and told to lie down and keep {{themselves}} in readiness, in case their services should be required. The officers struggled forward to the edge, and tried {{to see what was}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> in the bay below; but little could be seen, save the mighty sheets of spray, as the waves struck the cliffs. Here and there in the wild waters they fancied occasionally that they could see the dark forms of the ships, but even of this they could not have been certain, save for the twinkling lights which rose and fell, and dashed to and fro like fire-flies in their flight. Now and then the flash of a cannon momentarily showed some ship laboring in the trough of the mountainous sea.|$|E
6000|$|We reached Louisville in time--at {{least the}} {{neighborhood}} of it. We stuck hard and fast on the rocks {{in the middle of}} the river, and lay there four days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part of the boat's family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger brother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this grandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those people. I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort of presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the least trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert for an opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came at last. The riotous powwow of setting a spar was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>down</b> on the forecastle, and I went down there and stood around in the way--or mostly skipping out of it--till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to bring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: 'Tell me where it is--I'll fetch it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, dearest Lucy," [...] said Fanny, {{immediately}} <b>going</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{her knees}} before her, [...] "I won't be unkind to you again." [...] And {{then they had}} a great cry together.|$|R
