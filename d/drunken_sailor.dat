5|$|Sycorax {{has been}} conceptualised {{in a variety}} ways by {{adapters}} and directors of The Tempest. In John Dryden and William Davenant's version of The Tempest (1670), Sycorax is survived by two children, Caliban and a daughter also named Sycorax. This second Sycorax makes sexual advances toward Trinculo, the <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor,</b> and (according to Trinculo) also has incestuous relations with her brother Caliban. Die Geisterinsel, a 1778 version of the play in German, includes a living Sycorax, a witch who has full power during the night, while Prospero rules the day. In this play, {{she is the one}} who causes the tempest and shipwreck, not Prospero; Prospero is extremely wary of her actions as each night approaches, as she has power over those who sleep. Several times he struggles to keep Miranda awake to protect her from Sycorax's power. In Eugène Scribe's French 1846 version, Sycorax is alive but imprisoned behind some rocks out of sight. She spends most of the play trying to convince her son, Caliban, to free her. Peter Brook's 1968 British version of the play portrayed Sycorax as an ugly witch, including her in a birth scene in which the equally ugly Caliban is born.|$|E
500|$|Among Bottomley's {{principal}} biographers, Hyman {{suggests that}} his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of {{wealth in the}} 1890s. [...] "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor</b> and could never break the habit." [...] It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison {{as long as he}} did. Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley's [...] "wonderfully rich public personality" [...] but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was [...] "more a series of public attitudes than a person". Matthew Engel in The Guardian notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: [...] "I am not sorry I lent him the money, and I would do it again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor</b> in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E

2500|$|Joe Pentland {{was another}} popular early singing clown {{and one of}} the first to get top billing. [...] He worked with Aron Turner's Circus, and then with Sands & Lent.

[...] Posing as a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor,</b> Pentland emerged from the stands offering to ride an ornery horse, and was greeted with various hoots and cheers.

While driving his car in a rowdy section of Superior, he saw a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor</b> stab a woman to death. He then acted on a call he felt to the priesthood. But due to his limited formal education, he enrolled at Saint Francis High School Seminary – the minor seminary of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee – [...] in January 1891, hoping to become a diocesan priest. Classes there were taught in either German or Latin, neither of which he knew how to speak. In due course he was advised that – due to his academic limitations – he should consider joining a religious order if he wanted to become a priest. There, he could be ordained as a [...] "simplex" [...] priest, who could preside at a Mass but would not have the [...] for public preaching or hearing confessions. He returned home before deciding to make his application.|$|E
2500|$|Trueman quickly alienated the West Indian crowds who disliked his belligerent style, {{especially}} when he followed instructions and did not show sympathy for batsmen he had hit with the ball. The West Indian fans nicknamed him [...] ""Mr Bumper Man" [...] and someone wrote a calypso about him {{that was based on}} the sea shanty <b>Drunken</b> <b>Sailor.</b> He fell foul of off-field incidents too, including one in which he and Tony Lock were blamed for something done by Denis Compton who, as the [...] "golden boy" [...] of English cricket, was effectively beyond reproach. It was while the team was in Barbados {{that one of the most}} repeated [...] "Trueman stories" [...] is said to have originated, although it is almost certainly apocryphal. At a dinner, Trueman is said to have ordered a local dignitary, apparently the Indian High Commissioner, to: [...] "Pass t'salt, Gunga Din". At the end of the tour, to his outrage, Trueman had his good-conduct bonus docked. No reason was given and he tried without success to obtain one, but neither Hutton nor MCC would elaborate. Trueman never forgave Hutton and the two never played together for England again.|$|E

60|$|A dull lamp swung overhead, {{placed in}} a wooden ship {{suspended}} from the ceiling.

60|$|In {{front of}} a rough shanty, built just within the line of shade of the cocoanuts, sat three men. Two <b>drunken</b> <b>sailors</b> lay asleep some fifty yards away.

He did not feel surprise--something in him had known she would come again. He would not move a muscle lest he lose her as he had lost her before. They looked at each other--for how long?

The gentlemen who stay at home at ease may think damp sheets dangerous, but Malvern had long ago taught me the perfect safety of the wettest bivouac, provided that the body remains warm. At Fernando Po, as at Zanzibar, a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor</b> after a night in the gutter will catch fever, and will probably die. But he has exposed himself to the inevitable chill after midnight, he is unacclimatized, and both places are exceptionally deadly--to {{say nothing of the}} liquor.

6000|$|When he had {{finished}} the sugar, he rolled {{out of the door}} with a half-diffident, half-inviting look in his eyes as if he expected me to follow. I did so; but the sniffing and snorting of the keen-scented Pomposo in the hollow not only revealed the cause of his former terror, but decided me to take another direction. After a moment's hesitation, he concluded to go with me, although I am satisfied, from a certain impish look in his eye, that he fully understood and rather enjoyed the fright of Pomposo. As he rolled along at my side, with a gait not unlike a <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor,</b> I discovered that his long hair concealed a leather collar around his neck, which bore for its legend the single word [...] "Baby!" [...] I recalled the mysterious suggestion of the two miners. This, then, was the [...] "baby" [...] with whom I was to [...] "play." ...|$|E
60|$|Their {{houses were}} earthen-walled and straw-thatched. Under the floors ran flues {{through which the}} kitchen smoke escaped, warming the sleeping- room in its passage. Here we lay and rested for days, {{soothing}} ourselves with their mild and tasteless tobacco, which we smoked in tiny bowls {{at the end of}} yard-long pipes. Also, there was a warm, sourish, milky-looking drink, heady only when taken in enormous doses. After guzzling I swear gallons of it, I got singing drunk, which is the way of sea-cunies the world over. Encouraged by my success, the others persisted, and soon we were all a-roaring, little reeking of the fresh snow gale piping up outside, and little worrying that we were cast away in an uncharted, God-forgotten land. Old Johannes Maartens laughed and trumpeted and slapped his thighs with the best of us. Hendrik Hamel, a cold-blooded, chilly-poised dark brunette of a Dutchman with beady black eyes, was as rarely devilish as the rest of us, and shelled out silver like any <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor</b> for the purchase of more of the milky brew. Our carrying-on was a scandal; but the women fetched the drink while all the village that could crowd in jammed the room to witness our antics.|$|E
60|$|The meeting now assumed {{its former}} air of earnestness, {{and it was}} not hard to see that the arrival of my unhappy and {{degraded}} fellow-countryman had introduced a new element into the debate. Man after man spoke, and finally the chief rose, as I had little doubt, to sum up the discussion. He pointed to myself, and to William Bludger alternately, and the words which I had already noted, Thargeelyah, and farmakoi, frequently recurred in his speech. His ideas seemed to meet with general approval; even the old priest laid aside his sickle, and beat applause with his hands. He next rose, and, taking two garlands of beautiful flowers from the horns of the altar, placed one wreath on the head of the <b>drunken</b> <b>sailor,</b> who had fallen asleep by this time. He then drew near me, and I had little doubt that he meant to make me also wear a garland, like some woman of rank and fashion at a giddy secular entertainment. Whatever his motive might be I was determined to wear nothing of the kind. But here some attendants grappled and held me, my hat was lifted from my brows, and the circlet of blossoms was carefully entwined all round my hat. The head- covering was then replaced, the whole assembly, forming a circle, danced around me and the unconscious Bludger, and, finally, the old priest, turning his face alternately to me and to the sun, intoned a hymn, the audience joining in at intervals.|$|E

60|$|All over, {{the ship}} was in a most {{dilapidated}} condition; but in the forecastle {{it looked like the}} hollow of an old tree going to decay.

Moreover, it was hacked and hewed without mercy, the cook frequently helping himself to splinters for kindling-wood from the bitts and beams.
