40|$|Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are {{transmitted}} by vectors, such as mosquitoes, to susceptible vertebrates. Recent {{research has shown}} that arbovirus replication and spread in mosquitoes is not passively tolerated but induces <b>host</b> <b>responses</b> to control these pathogens. Small RNA-mediated <b>host</b> <b>responses</b> are key players among these antiviral immune strategies. Studies into one such small RNA-mediated antiviral response, the exogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, have generated a wealth of information on the functions of this mechanism and the enzymes which mediate antiviral activities. However, other small RNA-mediated <b>host</b> <b>responses</b> may also be involved in modulating antiviral activity. The aim of this review is to summarize recent research into the nature of small RNA-mediated antiviral responses in mosquitoes and to discuss future directions for this relatively new area of research...|$|R

25|$|Viruses {{can remain}} intact from {{apoptosis}} {{in particular in}} the latter stages of infection. They can be exported in the apoptotic bodies that pinch off {{from the surface of}} the dying cell, and the fact that they are engulfed by phagocytes prevents the initiation of a <b>host</b> <b>response.</b> This favours the spread of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{periodontitis}} is {{initiated by}} Gram-negative tooth-associated microbial biofilms that elicit a <b>host</b> <b>response,</b> {{which results in}} bone and soft tissue destruction. In response to endotoxin derived from periodontal pathogens, several osteoclast-related mediators target the destruction of alveolar bone and supporting connective tissue such as the periodontal ligament. Major drivers of this aggressive tissue destruction are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and other osteoclast-derived enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of CRISPR {{sequences}} revealed coevolution of {{host and}} viral genomes. Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in pathogenic and commensal bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation {{may contribute to}} the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, Francisella novicida uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial lipoprotein that is critical for F. novicida to dampen <b>host</b> <b>response</b> and promote virulence.|$|E

25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive. Such changes may be part of a productive <b>host</b> <b>response</b> to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why we feel 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E
2500|$|Upon infection, {{influenza}} virus induces a <b>host</b> <b>response</b> involving increased production of reactive oxygen species, {{and this can}} damage the virus genome. [...] If, under natural conditions, virus survival is ordinarily vulnerable {{to the challenge of}} oxidative damage, then multiplicity reactivation is likely selectively advantageous as a kind of genomic repair process. [...] It has been suggested that multiplicity reactivation involving segmented RNA genomes may be similar to the earliest evolved form of sexual interaction in the RNA world that likely preceded the DNA world. (Also see RNA world hypothesis.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} plaque-induced {{gingivitis}} is bacterial plaque, which acts {{to initiate the}} body's <b>host</b> <b>response.</b> [...] This, in turn, can lead to destruction of the gingival tissues, which may progress to destruction of the periodontal attachment apparatus. [...] The plaque accumulates in the small gaps between teeth, in the gingival grooves and in areas known as plaque traps: locations that serve to accumulate and maintain plaque. [...] Examples of plaque traps include bulky and overhanging restorative margins, claps of removable partial dentures and calculus (tartar) that forms on teeth. Although these accumulations may be tiny, the bacteria in them produce chemicals, such as degradative enzymes, and toxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, otherwise known as endotoxin) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), that promote an inflammatory response in the gum tissue. [...] This inflammation can cause an enlargement of the gingiva and subsequent formation. Early plaque in health consists of a relatively simple bacterial community dominated by Gram-positive cocci and rods. As plaque matures and gingivitis develops, the communities become increasingly complex with higher proportions of Gram-negative rods, fusiforms, filaments, spirilla and spirochetes. Later experimental gingivitis studies, using culture, provided more information regarding the specific bacterial species present in plaque. Taxa associated with gingivitis included Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum, Lachnospiraceae [...] species HOT100, Lautropia species HOTA94, and Prevotella oulorum (a species of Prevotella bacterium), whilst Rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. Further study of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent periodontal disease.|$|E
40|$|Plant tissues host {{a variety}} of fungi. One {{important}} group is the dark septate endophytes (DSE) that colonize plant roots and form characteristic intracellular structures – melanized hyphae and microsclerotia.

Reviews suggest {{that the proportion of}} plant species colonized by DSE equal that colonized by AM and microscopic studies show that the proportion of the root system colonized by fungi DSE can equal, or even exceed, the colonization by AM fungi. Despite the high frequency and suspected ecological importance, the effects of DSE colonization on plant growth and performance have remained unclear. Here, we draw from over a decade of experimentation with the obscure DSE symbiosis and synthesize across large bodies of published and unpublished data from Arabidopsis thaliana and Allium porrum model systems as well as from experiments that use native plants to better resolve the <b>host</b> <b>responses</b> to DSE colonization.
