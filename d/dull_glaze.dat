The <b>dull</b> <b>glaze</b> which seemed to veil the outer world from the drunkard's pupils shifted {{suddenly}} with such a look of direct horror that Demorest was fain to turn away his own. But the veil mercifully returned, and with it Dick's worked-up sense of injury. Nobody was there--not [...] "a shole." [...] Did Demorest think if there had been any of his friends there they would have stood by like [...] "dogsh" [...] and seen him insulted? ...|$|E

60|$|But Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve sat there, transfixed with horror. No {{answering}} gleam now {{shot through}} his <b>dull,</b> <b>glazed</b> eye. For he alone knew that whatever {{made the case}} against the prisoner look worse, made his own position each moment more awful and more intolerable.|$|R
40|$|A {{diatribe}} on dummies One either hates or likes soothers,dummies, or pacifiers. Their useis {{widespread and}} seems to have become semi-automatic, semi-epidemic, and semi-prescriptive. A pacifier is de-fined as a rubber object that a baby is given to suck so that the baby feels com-forted and stays quiet. Their manufac-ture is covered by the British Standard Number BS 5239. I do not like dummies. My objections are on aesthetic grounds: constant dummy use makes infants and toddlers look distant, <b>dull,</b> <b>glazed,</b> sometimes semi-hypnotised; on hygienic grounds: they are associated with mouth infec...|$|R

60|$|To that cabin {{below the}} whole company {{repaired}} in all speed in the surgeon's wake, Sir Oliver coming last between his guards. They assembled about the couch where Lionel lay, leaden-hued of face, his breathing laboured, his eyes <b>dull</b> and <b>glazing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Richard DeVore (1933 - 25 June 2006) was an American ceramicist {{that was}} born in Toledo, Ohio in 1933. He earned a B.Ed. degree with an art major from the University of Toledo in 1955, and {{received}} an M.F.A. from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1957. In 1966 DeVore became head of the ceramics department at Cranbrook Academy of Art. He {{was a member of}} the Colorado State University art faculty from 1978 to 2004. In 1987, DeVore was installed as a fellow of the American Craft Council. Based in Fort Collins, Colorado, He is known for simple, organic forms finished in <b>dull</b> <b>glazes</b> that suggest polished stones, sun bleached bones or even translucent skin. He died from lung cancer in Fort Collins on June 25, 2006. Meulensteen Gallery in New York represents his estate.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stumbled}} {{on a few}} steps, a little black snake crept out of its bed of mud, {{and looked at him}} with yellow eyes protruding from its upraised head. He kicked it savagely away--a crumpled, shapeless mass. It was a piece of brutality typical of the man. Ahead he fancied that the air was clearer--the fetid mists less choking--in the deep night-silence a few hours back he had fancied that he had heard the faint thunder of the sea. If this were indeed so, it would be but a short distance now {{to the end of his}} journey. With <b>dull,</b> <b>glazed</b> eyes and clenched hands, he reeled on. A sort of stupor had laid hold of him, but through it all his brain was working, and he kept steadily to a fixed course. Was it the sea in his ears, he wondered, that long, monotonous rolling of sound, and there were lights before his eyes--the lights of Buckomari, or the lights of death! ...|$|R
60|$|But sleep {{had fled}} from his <b>dull</b> and <b>glazed</b> eyes. His mind wandered strangely, {{but he was}} awake, and conscious. The {{well-known}} shout of drunken mirth sounded in his ear, the glass was at his lips, the board was covered with choice rich food—they were before him: he could see them all, he had but to reach out his hand, and take them—and, though the illusion was reality itself, {{he knew that he}} was sitting alone in the deserted street, watching the rain-drops as they pattered on the stones; that death was coming upon him by inches—and that there were none to care for or help him.|$|R
5000|$|In Dungeons & Dragons, goblins {{are small}} {{humanoid}} monsters. They vary in height from about 3 to 3 ½ feet (91 - 106 cm) and weigh 40 to 45 pounds (21 - 24 kg). They walk upright {{even though their}} arms nearly reach their knees. Their eyes vary from red to yellow and are usually <b>dull</b> and <b>glazed.</b> Described as [...] "hideously ugly", they have a broad nose that sits on a flat face with pointed ears and a wide mouth. Their mouth contains small, but sharp fangs. Their skin pigment ranges from a deep red through nearly any shade of orange to yellow.

6000|$|But {{here was}} {{something}} quite different. Such a tragedy as this which had just occurred was {{possessed of a}} peculiar hideousness of its own. It seemed to have completely laid hold of the little group of men gathered round the body of Sir Geoffrey Kynaston; to have bereft them of all reasoning power and thought, to have numbed even their limbs and physical instincts. It {{was only a few}} minutes ago since they had left him, careless and debonair, with his thoughts intent upon the business, or rather the sport, of the hour. His laugh had been the loudest, his enjoyment the keenest, and his gun the most deadly of them all. But now he lay there cold and lifeless, with his heart's blood staining the green turf, and his sightless eyes <b>dull</b> and <b>glazed.</b> It was an awful thing! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may have}} been foolish of him: it {{may have been}} wrong: {{it may have been}} madness almost; but at that instant he felt dazzled and stunned by the {{crushing}} weight of the blow thus unexpectedly dealt at his whole preconceived theory of things, and at his entire mental scheme of science and theology. The universe seemed to swim aimlessly before him: he felt the solid ground knocked at once from beneath his feet, and found himself in one moment suspended alone above an awful abyss, a seething and tossing abyss of murky chaos. He had pinned all his tottering faith absolutely on that single frail support; and now the support had given way irretrievably beneath him, and blank atheism, nihilism, utter nothingness, stared him desperately in the face. In one minute, while he held his head tight between his two palms to keep it from bursting, and looked with a <b>dull,</b> <b>glazed,</b> vacant eye at the ghastly thing before him--only a few indistinct fossil bones, but to him the horridest sight he had ever beheld--a whole world of ideas crowded itself on the instant into his teeming, swimming brain. If we could compress an infinity of thought into a single second, said Shelley once, that second would be eternity; and on the brink of such a compressed eternity Cyril Milliter was then idly sitting. It seemed to him, as he clasped his forehead tighter and tighter, that the Truth which he had been seeking, and for which he had been working and fighting so long, revealed itself to him now and there, at last, in concrete form, as a visible and tangible Lie. It was no mere petrified lizard that he saw beneath his eyes, but a whole ruined and shattered system of philosophic theology. His cosmogony was gone; his cosmos itself was dispersed and disjointed; creation, nay, the Creator Himself, seemed to fade away slowly into nonentity before him. He beheld dimly an awful vision of a great nebulous mist, drifting idly before the angry storm-cyclones of the masterless universe--drifting without a God or a ruler to guide it; bringing forth shapeless monstrosities one after another on its wrinkled surface; pregnant with ravine, and rapine, and cruelty; vast, powerful, illimitable, awful; but without one ray of light, one gleam of love, one hope of mercy, one hint of divine purpose anywhere to redeem it. It was the pessimistic nightmare of a Lucretian system, translated hastily into terms of Cyril Milliter's own tottering and fading theosophy.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{maintains}} that glazes may be colored or textured {{by the addition}} of common substances such as metal filings, gravels, sands, or local clays. Three basic glazes were chosen: one transparent, one mat, and one semi-mat. To these basic glazes more than fifty inorganic materials were added in separate test batches. A diversity of results was produced ranging from a glossy, sand-speckled glaze to a rough glaze made with aluminum shavings; from a white, iridescent glaze made with gypsum to a <b>dull</b> gun-metal black <b>glaze</b> made with brass shavings; from a transparent colorless glaze made with aspirin tablets to a dark green translucent glaze made with copper filings. This study can be used as the basis for a unit on glazes in a secondary school classroom; its purpose is to serve as an introduction to glazes, while teaching the students an appreciation of some of the earth’s abundant raw materials and how they can be used in ceramic glazes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGrinding causes {{progressive}} <b>dulling</b> and <b>glazing</b> of {{the grinding}} wheel grains and clogging of the voids on the wheel's surface with ground metal dust particles, which gradually increases the grinding forces. The {{condition of the}} grains at the periphery of a grinding wheel strongly influences the damage induced in a ground workpiece. Therefore, truing and dressing {{must be carried out}} frequently. Dressing is the process of conditioning the grinding wheel surface to reshape the wheel when it has lost its original shape through wear, giving the tool its original condition of efficiency. Despite the very broad range of dressing tools available today, the single-point diamond dresser is still the most widely used dressing tool due to its great versatility. The aim of this work is to predict the wear level of the single-point dresser based on acoustic emission and vibration signals used as input variables for fuzzy models. Experimental tests were performed with synthetic diamond dressers on a surface-grinding machine equipped with an aluminum oxide grinding wheel. Acoustic emission and vibration sensors were attached to the tool holder and the signals were captured at 2 MHz. During the tests, the wear of the diamond tip was measured every 20 passes using a microscope with 10 to 100 X magnification. A study was conducted of the frequency content of the signals, choosing the frequency bands that best correlate with the diamond's wear. Digital band-pass filters were applied to the raw signals, after which two statistics were calculated to serve as the inputs for the fuzzy models. The results indicate that the fuzzy models using the aforementioned signal statistics are highly effective for predicting the wear level of the dresser...|$|R
60|$|Often had De Montespan feigned a faint in {{the days}} when she wished to disarm the anger of the king. So she had drawn his arms round her, and won the pity which is the twin sister of love. But now she knew what it was to have the senses struck out of her by a word. She could not doubt the truth of what she heard. There was that in her rival's face, in her steady eye, in her quiet voice, which carried {{absolute}} conviction with it. She stood stunned for an instant, panting, her outstretched hands feeling at the air, her defiant eyes <b>dulling</b> and <b>glazing.</b> Then, with a short sharp cry, the wail of one who has fought hard and yet knows that she can fight no more, her proud head drooped, and she fell forward senseless at the feet of her rival. Madame de Maintenon stooped and raised her up in her strong white arms. There was true grief and pity in her eyes as {{she looked down at the}} snow-pale face which lay against her bosom, all the bitterness and pride gone out of it, and nothing left save the tear which sparkled under the dark lashes, and the petulant droop of the lip, like that of a child which had wept itself to sleep. She laid her on the ottoman and placed a silken cushion under her head. Then she gathered together and put back into the open cupboard all the jewels which were scattered about the carpet. Having locked it, and placed the key on the table where its owner's eye would readily fall upon it, she struck a gong, which summoned the little black page.|$|R
5000|$|During his summers at HOP Ranch, {{interspersed}} with time at Colorado College and in Colorado Springs during {{other parts of}} the year, Van Briggle pursued his quest to identify potting soils so [...] "the lost art of the Chinese might be revived." [...] He sought to re-create the <b>dull</b> satin matte <b>glaze</b> of Chinese potters of the 14th-century Ming Dynasty. In 1901, Van Briggle had a major breakthrough perfecting his process. In August he invited friends to visit his studio at HOP Ranch where he personalized some of the newly modeled pieces by impressing their initials in them. Van Briggle went on to enter his very best work in major exhibits at the Paris Salon of 1903, the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland. He garnered three gold, one silver, and a number of bronze medals. These awards propelled him to international acclaim. [...] He went on to found the Van Briggle Pottery and {{had a significant impact on}} the Art Nouveau movement in the United States. His pottery is foundational to American art pottery. [...] The Art Nouveau style favored by its founders continues to influence the pottery's designs.|$|R
