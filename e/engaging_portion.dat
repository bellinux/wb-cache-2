However, the processes that are being performed by both regions within this network and those outside of this network that are nevertheless engaged {{in the service of}} making a social judgment remain unclear. To help address this, we drew upon research in semantic memory, which suggests that making a semantic judg-ment engages 2 distinct control processes: A controlled retrieval process, which aids in bringing goal-relevant information to mind from long-term stores, and a selection process, which aids in selecting the information that is goal-relevant from the information retrieved. In a neuroimaging study, we investigated whether con-trolled retrieval and selection for social information <b>engage</b> distinct <b>portions</b> of both the social knowledge network and regions outside this network. Controlled retrieval for social information engaged an anterior ventrolateral portion of the prefrontal cortex, whereas se-lection engaged both the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and tempor-oparietal junction within the social knowledge network. These results suggest that the social knowledge network may be more involved with the selection of social information than the controlled retrieval of it and incorporates lateral prefrontal regions in acces-sing memory for making social judgments...|$|R

On the one hand, the labor force in this layer suffers from low job mobility and low-paid blue-collar work of the "cake portion" and is dominated by female semi-skilled workers. On the other hand, industrialists and governments in this layer enjoy the profits and high export values of the "cream" portion. Under the Fifth Kondratieff wave, the textile and clothing industries have become increasingly coordinated and controlled by a thinner "cream" layer.
