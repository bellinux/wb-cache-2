25|$|Runlock: This {{allows the}} vehicle's engine {{to be left}} running without the keys being in the ignition. This enables {{adequate}} power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle's equipment {{at the scene of}} an incident. The vehicle can only be driven off after re-inserting the keys. If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the <b>footbrake</b> is activated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emergency}} brake was originally intended for one particular emergency {{and that was}} [...] "no other way to stop", {{as was the case}} when the <b>footbrake</b> suddenly failed. Drivers had to respond when brakes failed, so they were expected to learn how to stop a speeding vehicle using the {{emergency brake}} alone. Safety regulations became almost universal by 1980, so modern brake systems are very reliable, using dual-circuit hydraulics and more recently low-brake-fluid sensors. As modern brakes no longer cause emergencies (a brake warning light comes on after the first sign of trouble), it is no longer necessary for the average driver to learn to use this brake for emergencies. Some drivers benefiting from the [...] "park" [...] function on their automatic transmissions do not use this brake at all (daily use of the park brake is recommended). After a lack of recent braking emergencies, automakers stopped using the term and started referring it by its other use, the [...] "parking brake", even though the ability to function at a high speed was still there. On an increasing number of modern vehicles, the parking brake can only be engaged when the vehicle is at a stop, and they no longer have an emergency brake.|$|E
60|$|We {{were just}} over the brow of this hill, where the grade is steepest, when the trouble began. I {{had been on the}} top speed, and wanted to get her on the free; but she stuck between gears, and I had to get her back on the top again. By this time she was going at a great rate, so I clapped on both brakes, and one after the other they gave way. I didn't mind so much when I felt my <b>footbrake</b> snap, but when I put all my weight on my side-brake, and the lever clanged to its full limit without a catch, it brought a cold sweat out of me. By this time we were fairly tearing down the slope. The lights were brilliant, and I brought her round the first curve all right. Then we did the second one, though it was a close shave for the ditch. There was a mile of {{straight}} then with the third curve beneath it, and after that the gate of the park. If I could shoot into that harbour all would be well, for the slope up to the house would bring her to a stand.|$|E
50|$|Handbrake J-Turn: After {{high-performance}} instructor Phillipe Létourneau gives everyone {{lessons on}} how to do a 180-degree handbrake skid turn from driving straight ahead at 40 km/h, the contestants must attempt to perform this maneuver within limited confines. Shelby does this on his second attempt, while for Ed, it takes six attempts - largely because he had used the <b>footbrakes</b> instead. For everyone else, this takes four attempts - Jason because of turning too soon or too late, Jennifer over using the <b>footbrakes</b> instead of the hand brake, and Billie-Jean because of not looking where she wanted to go.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the high}} speed a longboard can achieve (as fast as a car), being able to brake quickly is {{extremely}} important. Before learning braking techniques, {{it is common for}} riders to jump off the moving board and 'run out' their speed, but this is safe only at low speeds. This technique is considered dangerous and is least accepted in the longboarding community. If the rider is traveling faster than the speed at which they can run, other techniques are required, for example <b>footbraking</b> or sliding. <b>Footbraking</b> is the method of the rider dragging his foot on the ground while moving to slow himself down. However, this wears away the soles of shoes, creating holes that are potentially dangerous to the feet. More advanced riders use 'slide' methods of braking. Sliding is the method of pushing the edge of the board out so it is traveling sideways rather than forwards, and the wheels are sliding against the ground. The resulting friction slows the board down dramatically. Factors such as the height and length of the board and, crucially, durometer (softness) of the wheels affect how easy this is to do and how fast the rider must be travelling to achieve effective slides. Sliding also requires an efficient and precise use of body weight in order to be fully effective.|$|R
50|$|Sliding is {{the most}} {{effective}} braking technique for downhill skateboarders. It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than <b>footbraking,</b> but requires a wider area depending on his ability to control the slide. It has also evolved into its own discipline of skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. A few names of these slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendelum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide. Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as UHMWPE, Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider's speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check. Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to trim speed and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position {{over the course of the}} slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as laybacks, pressure spins, 5-0 slides, and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide {{is the most}} popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as you do a complete 180 degree turn with one hand on the ground.|$|R
50|$|The <b>footbrake</b> {{operated}} mechanically on {{the drive}} shaft while a cable operated handbrake applied stopping power to the rear wheels. The wheelbase on these early cars was 2255 mm.|$|E
50|$|After {{modifications}} to his race machines involving changing the gear-lever {{to the right}} side and fitting a thumb-operated rear brake instead of a <b>footbrake</b> lever, in 2013 he won the Macau Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|The three-speed manual transmission, {{controlled}} using a lever in {{the middle}} of the floor, conveyed power to the rear wheels. The <b>footbrake</b> operated on all four wheels via a cable linkage while the handbrake connected directly to the drive shaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{hand brake}} was {{originally}} {{intended for use}} in case of mechanical failure where the regular <b>footbrake</b> was inoperable or compromised (hence the emergency brake name). Modern brake systems are typically very reliable and equipped with dual-circuit hydraulics and low-brake-fluid sensor systems. Using the hand brake in any emergency is likely to badly upset the brake balance {{of the car and}} vastly increase the likelihood of loss of control of the vehicle, for example by initiating a rear-wheel skid. Additionally, the stopping force provided by using the handbrake is small and would not significantly aid in stopping the vehicle. Therefore it is generally unadvisable to use the hand brake for slowing down a vehicle if the <b>footbrake</b> is still operational.|$|E
50|$|Seven general {{principles}} apply: historical accuracy (American factory created/manufactured/supported makes and models); multiple carburetion preferred; intake manifolds produced by metal casting; maximum rear tire width designation of 10.5 inches; <b>footbrake</b> only, no transmission brake permitted; no electronic racing devices allowed (except ignition boxes); and competition conducted by class on established elapsed time indexes.|$|E
50|$|The chassis had rigid {{front and}} rear axles and leaf springs all round. Early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels {{operated}} by a hand lever, with a pedal-operated transmission brake acting on the propeller shaft. The <b>footbrake</b> system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913. Four-wheel servo-assisted brakes became optional in 1923.|$|E
50|$|In {{comparison}} with the footpedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is {{being used as a}} one-time backup for the <b>footbrake,</b> will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the <b>footbrake</b> to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as {{there is no need for}} them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.|$|E
50|$|Cars with {{automatic}} transmissions shut down upon braking {{to a full}} stop - the shut down is activated by the <b>footbrake</b> pedal being in use when the car comes to a halt. If the car is slowed initially by manual use of the automatic gear box and final stoppage is by use of the handbrake the engine will not shut down.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle's four-cylinder in-line side-valve engine front mounted Peugeot engine {{developed}} a maximum output of [...] at 3,200 rpm. Power {{was delivered to}} the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. The car had two rigid axles with transverse leaf springs. Claimed top speed was 80 km/h (50 mph). The <b>footbrake</b> operated on all four wheels via a hydraulic control mechanism.|$|E
50|$|When the {{handbrake}} {{is applied}} the (otherwise fixed) {{end of the}} spring is moved forward by a cam which releases the clutch and the car may stop without affecting the engine. Application of the <b>footbrake</b> has the same effect. This arrangement was deleted from the next model now the driver has control of the throttles and engine braking {{may be used to}} reduce the load on the brakes.|$|E
5000|$|Runlock: This {{allows the}} vehicle's engine {{to be left}} running without the keys being in the ignition. This enables {{adequate}} power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle's equipment {{at the scene of}} an incident. The vehicle can only be driven off after re-inserting the keys. If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the <b>footbrake</b> is activated.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time the <b>footbrake</b> operated, still using a cable linkage, on all four wheels, and the {{suspension}} system was also reworked. The steering wheel was moved from the right side to the left, reflecting a more general trend in Europe at the time. The fuel filler cap which till now had been positioned centrally between the back of the hood/bonnet and the base of the windscreen was now repositioned under the bonnet/hood.|$|E
5000|$|The 4/12 PS was {{produced}} through 1924 and 1925, {{with a few}} modifications {{in place for the}} second year, including a new fashionable [...] "boat-deck" [...] style rear end and a switch over in respect of the brakes so that in 1925 it was the <b>footbrake</b> pedal that operated via a cable linkage on the rear wheels and the hand brake that operated via a mechanical linkage directly on the drive shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Forward Handbrake J-Turn: In what {{is noted}} {{to be one}} of the show's harder challenges, the drivers must each drive a Ford Mustang coupe into a small turning space at 50 km/h, and use the {{handbrake}} to spin the car around 180 degrees while dodging an oversized foam birthday cake, before safely driving out of the space. Each driver has three chances to succeed. In his first turn, Jason somehow forgets that he's supposed to use the handbrake, and hits the far wall with the car still entirely facing forwards. He makes a similar mistake (using the <b>footbrake)</b> on his second turn, and his inability to even comprehend the difference between how a <b>footbrake</b> and a handbrake works causes the experts to again question Jason's suitability to drive at all. He finally gets the technique somewhat correct on his third attempt, but carries it out too late and hits a side wall, failing. Tyler relies on Q to read out his speed during his first two attempts, and he fails his first attempt when he uses the <b>footbrake.</b> His second attempt goes better, but only spins the car by about 140 degrees. His final attempt is taken too fast, at 60 km/h, but he still carries out the technique correctly; Andrew tells him that his speeding would normally cause this to be deemed a failure, but agrees to call it a pass since he did it without Q's help. Chanie appears to pass the challenge on her first attempt, but the experts and Andrew refuse to consider it a pass, as she pulled the handbrake early and missed the cake by just inches. She's forced to take her second run, and becomes unresponsive, forcing Jeremy to pull the handbrake for her. Jeremy is asked to sit out Chanie's third run, and she finally passes the challenge. Wayne asks to sit out Siham's run, afraid that the challenge would trigger his motion sickness, and Andrew is all too happy to take his place in the car, which will force Siham to think for herself. Unfortunately this does not lead to Andrew's hoped-for result, and she posts the worst performance of the day, smashing through the outer walls on all three attempts, causing Andrew to realize that her self-confidence is even lower than he (and Shaymala) previously thought it was. Mariah's run is less dramatic, but she fails all three attempts due to her using the <b>footbrake</b> instead of the handbrake.|$|E
5000|$|In her {{introductory}} chapter Levitt {{sets the}} scene by explaining {{that she is}} not writing for the benefit of those women who have already taken to motoring; her target audience is instead [...] "those women who would like to, but either dare not because of nervousness, or who imagine it is too difficult to understand the many necessary technical details". Photographs illustrating the topics that Levitt describes, including recommended motoring dress, adjusting the <b>footbrake</b> and changing a spark plug were taken by Horace Nicholls.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis {{took the}} form of an [...] "A" [...] with the engine mounted between the channel {{sections}} at the narrow front end. The rear suspension was by quarter elliptic springs cantilevered {{from the rear of the}} chassis while at the front the beam axle had a centrally mounted half elliptic transverse spring. Early cars did not have any shock absorbers. Brakes were on all wheels but at first the front brakes were operated by the handbrake and the rear by the <b>footbrake,</b> becoming fully coupled in 1930.|$|E
5000|$|Power {{came from}} a newly {{enlarged}} straight six 3,208 cc side-valve engine with a listed maximum output of [...] at 4,000 rpm, supporting a claimed top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). This was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which, unusually in the 1930s, incorporated synchromesh on all four ratios. The <b>footbrake</b> used a hydraulic control mechanism and operated on all four wheels. The suspension set-up was carried over from the W18 with a swing axle at the rear and the front axle suspended with a central transverse leaf spring and coil springs beside the wheels.|$|E
50|$|The car had an {{air-cooled}} 8 hp V-twin cylinder Chater-Lea engine {{driving the}} rear wheels through a two speed transmission with top gear being direct and the lower gear a chain reduction system. Reverse gear was obtained by diverting the drive through two friction wheels, one {{on the front of}} the propeller shaft and a larger one connected to the low gear countershaft in the transmission. The <b>footbrake</b> operated on {{the rear wheels}} with internal expanding shoes and the handbrake controlled a leather faced band contracting onto the main drive shaft. The final drive to the rear axle used a worm drive reduction system.|$|E
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2,867 cc side-valve engine {{produced}} a maximum output of [...] at 3,200 rpm. In 1935 the compression ratio was increased along with maximum power {{which was now}} given as [...] Power was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on the top two ratios. On standard-bodied cars, the 1:1 ratio was achieved with third gear, leaving the fourth ratio as an “overdrive” ratio. The rear wheels were attached to a swing axle while at the front a lateral leaf spring was complemented {{by a pair of}} coil springs. The <b>footbrake</b> applied stopping power to all four wheels via a hydraulic control mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Another {{excellent}} and long-term {{example of this}} principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the <b>footbrake</b> hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe {{in the form of}} the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total <b>footbrake</b> failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.|$|E
5000|$|The MarkII {{was similar}} to the MarkI, but the small 'bikini" [...] fairing became a larger half-fairing {{incorporating}} indicators. The fairing had been tested in Moto Guzzi's wind tunnel (which had been used to test race bike fairings in the 1950s). The new fairing had a rectangular headlight, rather than the earlier round item. Cylinder bores were coated with Moto Guzzi's patented [...] "Nikasil". Front suspension became air-assisted. The brake calipers on the front wheel, previously mounted on the front, were now mounted behind the forks. A new dualseat could now carry a pillion. Further changes included a revised instrument cluster derived from the 1000cc SP. Brakes were linked, with the handlebar lever operating the front right caliper and the <b>footbrake</b> operating both the front left and rear caliper.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cars and}} police {{motorcycles}} are {{fitted with a}} 'Runlock' system. This allows the vehicle's engine to be left running without the keys being in the ignition. This enables adequate power, without battery drain, to be supplied to the vehicle's equipment {{at the scene of}} an incident. The vehicle can only be driven after re-inserting the keys. If the keys are not re-inserted, the engine will switch off if the handbrake is disengaged or the <b>footbrake</b> is activated; or the sidestand is flipped up {{in the case of a}} motorcycle. Runlock is also commonly used when an officer is required to quickly decamp from a vehicle. By enabling Runlock, the car's engine can be left running without the risk of someone stealing the vehicle: if the vehicle is driven normally, it will shut down, unless the Runlock system is turned off.|$|E
5000|$|The Valiant's {{suspension}} {{was tested}} by the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment at Chertsey in May 1945. The first day gave minor problems and was abandoned after only 13 mi of easy on-road driving. However, the driver was already exhausted by this time, finding that the steering levers needed his full weight to operate and that the seat, <b>footbrake</b> and gearlever all carried risk of physical injury in using them. The Officer in Charge decided to abandon the trials there and then as it was impossible and unsafe to continue, reporting that [...] "in his view the entire project should be closed" [...] There were also issues with weight distribution and the ground clearance of only 9 inches, and by that point of the war {{there was no longer}} a need for the tank. The Valiant project was terminated.|$|E
50|$|Around 50 SD Freighter chassis were {{fitted with}} bus type bodies and used at seaside resorts {{in the summer}} season. The largest {{operator}} was W.R. Gates who named the vehicles 'Tramocars' and operated a fleet in Worthing from 1924 until the business {{was taken over by}} Southdown in 1938 who continued to run Tramocars until 1940. The Amberley Working Museum utilised an ex-City of Truro SD Freighter chassis to build a replica Tramocar which regularly carries visitors to the museum, and commemorates the Worthing Tramocar service. Contrary to an earlier entry the control pedals have NOT been moved and the accelerator is still in the middle with <b>footbrake</b> on the right and the gong on the left. David Kaye gives a full account of SD Freighters as buses in Buses Extra October-November 1987.The Southdown Enthusiasts' Club http://www.southdownenthusiastsclub.org.uk published an account of the Worthing Tramocars in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Forward Handbrake J-Turn: In {{another of}} the show's {{traditional}} challenges, the drivers are each required to make a handbrake turn in a Mini Cooper and swerve around a foam person featuring the driver's own face inside a confined space; each driver has five attempts. Kevin is first up, and in a change of form nearly gets it on his first attempt, failing mostly because he took the run at 70 km/h instead of the requested 40 km/h; he reduces his speed for his second run, and {{for only the second}} time this season passes a challenge. Flora's woeful run of challenges continues, as she goes too slow in her first run, clips the entry obstacles in the second, drives directly into the foam Flora on the third, uses the <b>footbrake</b> instead of the handbrake on the fourth, before plowing through the foam Flora again and this time ending up in the adjoining field in her final run; this leads Andrew to describe Flora's performance as the worst he's ever seen for this particular challenge. Azim, who is now finally showing confidence and self-belief, predicts he will pass this challenge on the first go, and actually succeeds in doing so. Before Margherita's run, Andrew shows Margherita a series of articles listing accidents and fatalities that have been caused by drivers wearing high heels and wedges, but Cheryl loudly insists that his concerns are untrue and that it's perfectly safe to wear heels. This leads to her badmouthing Andrew and the experts after she and Margherita get in the car, unaware that the experts are listening to every word she says. Margherita ultimately fails the challenge after repeatedly using the <b>footbrake</b> instead of the handbrake, and while Cheryl attempts to blame Andrew for upsetting her prior to the challenge, Margherita herself accepts full responsibility and admits to not focusing well enough. Despite being predicted for success by Andrew, Diane fares surprisingly poorly, attempting the manoeuvre too late on her first run, going too slowly on her next three runs, and then hitting the foam Diane on her final run.|$|E
50|$|Rear {{drum brakes}} are {{typically}} of a leading/trailing design (for non-servo systems), or primary/secondary (for duo servo systems) the shoes being moved {{by a single}} double-acting hydraulic cylinder and hinged at the same point. In this design, one of the brake shoes always experiences the self-applying effect, irrespective of whether the vehicle is moving forwards or backwards. This is particularly useful on the rear brakes, where the parking brake (handbrake or <b>footbrake)</b> must exert enough force to stop the vehicle from traveling backwards and hold it on a slope. Provided the contact area of the brake shoes is large enough, which isn't always the case, the self-applying effect can securely hold a vehicle when the weight is transferred to the rear brakes due to the incline of a slope or the reverse direction of motion. A further advantage of using a single hydraulic cylinder on the rear is that the opposite pivot may {{be made in the}} form of a double-lobed cam that is rotated by the action of the parking brake system.|$|E
50|$|Later, Bean has {{purchased}} many items, including the armchair {{that was on}} display in the window, tins of paint, brushes and mops. After strapping the armchair to the roof, he runs into a problem: because he squeezed everything else inside of the car, there is no room left for himself. However, he manages to construct a way of driving the car while sitting on the armchair. He first places a brick attached to a string in front of the front wheel to hold the car, and releases the handbrake. He then uses a paint can attached to another string to operate the clutch, further strings for the gear stick and steering wheel, and joins his mop and broom together to form a long rod with which to operate the accelerator and <b>footbrake.</b> At first, all goes incredibly well, but he ends up on a steep downhill slope after swerving to avoid a roadworks barrier (and behind a parked police car). He desperately tries to keep the car under control as it starts to pick up speed, and things get worse when the head accidentally comes off the broom. Now with no way to stop the car, his only braking method is to drive it into a parked lorry delivering mattresses, creating an explosion of pillow feathers.|$|E
50|$|Camaro Challenge: Handbrake J-Turn - The contestants {{must take}} on the {{traditional}} challenge in the Camaro this year (but at 60 km/h). Jamie picks up the lesson quickly, but is too nervous come challenge time; she hits the foot brakes repeatedly, and fails her set 7 runs. Again, Andrew will accompany Brad on his run due to Donna's injuries {{and the nature of}} the challenge, and Andrew makes Brad do a few dry runs before making his attempts. Brad manages to pass after three attempts (the first two failing due to hitting the foot brake), but Cam is quick to discount Brad's accomplishment, as in his mind Andrew had overstepped his bounds by helping too much. Before Lance's run, though, the rain hits, and so Andrew tells Lance to never accelerate above 70 km/h due to hydroplaning concerns (though Andrew also adds that the course speed limit is now lowered to the standard 50 km/h due to the rain). Lance fails his first three runs by triggering both the handbrake and <b>footbrake</b> before making the turn, and then fails his next three by triggering the handbrake too late. Lance then fails his last chance by failing to find the hand brake (as he had taken his hand off of it). Dale's 7 runs all have her triggering the foot brake (and some of the runs by hitting the obstacles en route to the turning obstacle), prompting her to think that this is beyond her.|$|E
5000|$|Camaro Challenge: Handbrake J-Turn: For this challenge, {{which has}} run {{in nearly every}} season, the drivers are {{required}} to make a handbrake turn in a confined space, avoid hitting a foam figurine which features the face of their nominator, and drive out of the space. Each driver will have three runs. The Camaro has also been outfitted with a [...] "cutter handbrake", due to the car's original handbrake having broken during a test run the previous day, and the cutter brake being the only replacement immediately available. During the challenge, Cam pointed out that using the handbrake J-turn on public roads would be illegal {{as it would be}} considered a stunt manoeuver. Sly passes the challenge at his first attempt, much to the surprise of both Fred and Andrew, who both concede that this time he actually passed the challenge through grasping the technique rather than just getting lucky. Michael also passes on his first go, though comes close to hitting the boxes {{on the outside of the}} turning area. Kevin, while seeming to broadly understand the technique, fails all three of his runs due to staying on the gas for too long, and also leaving it too late to brake. Dale, who takes the challenge in a Honda Civic rather than the Camaro, fails her first two runs due to hitting the <b>footbrake</b> instead of pulling the handbrake. She attempts to give up after that, but Andrew persuades to carry on and attempt a final run; while she remembers to use the handbrake this time, she doesn't steer enough and crashes through the barrier, failing again.|$|E
5000|$|Mustang Challenge: Reverse Flick: After Andrew reiterates {{the harsh}} {{penalties}} {{that a person}} would face for actually carrying out this trick while on the road (though adding that such techniques are an effective tool when done in safe conditions), the drivers each get a lesson from Philippe in how to unbalance the car's steering and then spin it around 180 degrees. They then have to spin the Mustang around in a confined space, with each driver getting five attempts. Daniella is first-up, and on her first attempt she panics and stops before ever reaching the turning area. On her second turn she crashes into the barrier leading into the turning area, but on her third attempt she manages to pass, earning only her second challenge pass for the season. Krystal, who is accompanied by Andrew in her run, after she and Steven had a physical altercation between challenges, passes on her first go, despite steering a little erratically while reversing, leaving Andrew {{more than a little}} concerned that Krystal might end up being the only viable graduate this episode. Tyler nearly passes on his first attempt, spinning the car around without hitting anything, but pushing the <b>footbrake</b> in the process. He's therefore made to carry out a second run, which this time he passes. Lou's first run ends in disaster, as she takes the turn too slowly and then panics and mistakenly hits the gas instead of the brake. She then fails her second run by hitting the entry lane barrier, but just barely passes on her third run, making this a rare challenge with a 100% success rate.|$|E
