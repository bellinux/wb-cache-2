40|$|Flammability of {{synthetic}} fibres is significantly worse than that of bulk polymers {{because of the high}} surface area to volume ratio and the low tolerance to high filler loadings in the fibre production process. Introducing nanocomposite structures has the potential to enhance the char formation at relatively low loadings of nanoparticulate fillers and hence can reduce the flammability {{of synthetic}} polymers and fibres.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Nitric oxide is {{released}} from pulmonary endothelial cells {{and contributes to}} the low pulmonary vascular resistance. The resistance pulmonary arteries are in close anatomical proximity to membranous airways, so {{it is likely that}} some pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide will enter the airspace to allow its measurement in the exhaled breath. METHODS [...] Exhaled air was collected from a single full exhalation and during tidal breathing. This was analysed for concentrations of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide to give alveolar (FA) and mixed expired (FE) concentrations. Eight normal subjects were studied and laboratory air was similarly analysed using, respectively, chemiluminescent and <b>infrared</b> <b>analysers.</b> RESULTS [...] There was no relation between FA concentrations and the laboratory air concentrations. From the single breath, the ratio of (Fano/Faco 2) x (Feco 2 /Feno) had a mean value of 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval 0. 7 to 1. 14). As this does not differ from unity, nitric oxide is likely to be derived from the same regions of the lungs as carbon dioxide. During tidal breathing the Feno ranged from 8. 3 to 20. 3 parts per billion. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is possible to measure endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide production in the exhaled air in man...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{pyrolysis}} is the initial, accompanying {{reaction of}} a number of coal conversion processes such as hydrogenation, combustion and gasification. However, because of the inherent complexity of coal composition, it is difficult to describe coal pyrolysis clearly. Single model compounds have been used before in order to provide additional insight into the complex processes that occur in the pyrolysis of coal. Yet the picture obtained is a simplified one and certain important aspects such as coal structure, interactions between different surface groups and cross-links are omitted. The approach used in this work involves the preparation of a synthetic coal, SC, with a known structure by curing a mixture of single, well-defined model compounds. By means of chemical characterisation, the SC was shown to contain the macroscopic features of a high volatile coal (proximate and ultimate analyses). FTIR characterisation revealed the presence of functional groups similar to those of coal {{in the structure of the}} SC. Temperature-programmed pyrolysis tests were performed in a thermobalance linked to a mass spectrometer and a Fourier transform <b>infrared</b> <b>analyser</b> (TG/MS/FTIR). The thermal behaviour of the synthetic coal (i. e., rate of mass loss and the evolution profiles of gaseous compounds during pyrolysis tests) is very similar to that of the high volatile bituminous coal which was used as a reference material. The great advantage of using SC lies in the fact that its composition and structure can be accurately determined and employed in subsequent applications in basic and mechanistic studies.

To assess gaseous emissions, both indoor and outdoor gas concentrations were monitored using a photo-acoustic <b>infrared</b> <b>analyser</b> (INNOVA 1312). Air flow rates were estimated using SF 6 tracer gas. Mass balances were also performed with zootechnical data to validate themeasurements and interpolate data between measurement periods.

In the first system, the outdoor run consisted of grassland (GRASS) but in the second, the outdoor run was planted with oaks (TREE). Two batches of broilers were studied from winter to spring (WS) and from summer to autumn (SA). Indoor and outdoor airborne concentrations of NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 O weremeasured using a photoacoustic <b>infrared</b> <b>analyser.</b> Air flow rate through the broiler house was estimated using SF 6 tracer gas. The final amount and composition of the manure was determined. A mass balance was determined for N, P and water. Results showed that in SA, more nutrients were excreted in the outdoor run (41 %) compared with WS (11 %). During the WS season, outdoor excretion was greater in the TREE system but this was notobserved during SA. Ammonia indoor emissions were higher during WS (200 - 283 mg [NH 3] d- 1 bird- 1) than during SA (99 - 116 mg [NH 3] d- 1 bird- 1). Total emissions from the systems (indoor þ outdoor) were assessed using our values and data from the literature for outdoor emissions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the two methods in the clinical evaluation of patients with obstructive and non-obstructive pulmonary disorders. METHODS [...] Measurements of TLCO with the intrabreath method were carried out on a study sample composed of 50 patients with non-obstructive disorders and 50 with airways obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC < 70 %) either before or after a single breath measurement of the TLCO had been performed. The method involves the continuous analysis of a single slow expirate using a computerised rapid multigas <b>infrared</b> <b>analyser.</b> TLCO, alveolar volume (VA), TLCO/VA, and inspired vital capacity (IVC) values were obtained for both groups by both methods. RESULTS [...] When measured with the intrabreath method the group with airways obstruction showed lower TLCO and TLCO/VA values than the non-obstructive group. VA was higher in both patient groups when measured with the intrabreath technique. The same test also showed higher TLCO values with the intrabreath method in the group with non-obstructive disorders and lower TLCO/VA values with the intrabreath method in those with airways obstruction. The corresponding parameters obtained by the two methods correlated closely, with no correlation between the magnitude of the differences with the magnitude of the readings. An index of gas mixing indicated a better distribution of the inspired air for the intrabreath method than for the single breath method. The VA values obtained with the intrabreath method showed a closer agreement to the actual total lung capacities measured by body plethysmography. CONCLUSION [...] The intrabreath method of determining TLCO is comparable to the traditional single breath method. Measurement of alveolar volume by the intrabreath method approximates more closely to total lung capacity, even in subjects with airways obstruction...|$|E

Effect of CO in the gas atmosphere Oil the reduction behaviour of alumina was also studied, temperature-programmed and isothermal reduction experiments were conducted in a laboratory fixed bed reactor in the high temperature furnace in the temperature range 1500 - 1700 °C. The off-gas composition in the reduction process was monitored by a CO/CO 2 /CH 4 <b>infrared</b> <b>analyser.</b> The extent of reduction was calculated using data on the gas composition and LECO oxygen analysis. Phase composition of reduced samples was studied using XRD. The major findings of this project are as follows : -The reduction of alumina to aluminium carbide occurred through gaseous Al 2 O and Al. The reduction started with reduction of alumina by carbon to Al(g) and Al 2 O(g); alumina was further reduced to Al 2 O vapour by gaseous aluminium. Al 2 O reacted with graphite producing Al vapour and carbide Al 4 C 3. -Rate and extent of reduction of alumina increased with increasing temperature. -Reduction rate of alumina was faster in hydrogen and helium than in argon. The difference in the reduction rate in hydrogen and helium was insignificant. Aluminium carbide produced by reduction in helium was more stable than that in hydrogen. The carbon of Al 4 C 3 reacted with hydrogen to form methane. -High rate of reduction of alumina in hydrogen and helium was attributed to high diffusion coefficient of the gaseous species. -Addition of CO retarded the carbothermal reduction of alumina. -Increasing gas flow rate or decreasing gas pressure increased the reduction rate what was attributed to a faster mass transfer of gas species at high gas flow rate and low gas pressure. - Increasing the pellet porosity increased the reduction rate.

The advantage of a TCI approach for quality control is that the comparison covers the entire ambient air measurement system, including the sample intake system and the data evaluation process. For initial quality and performance control, the TCI was run in parallel with the Heidelberg GC before and after the measurement campaign at Mace Head. Median differences between the Heidelberg GC and the TCI were well within the WMO inter-laboratory compatibility target for all three greenhouse gases. At Mace Head, the median difference between the station GC and the TCI were − 0. 04 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4 and − 0. 37 nmol mol − 1 for N 2 O (GC-TCI). For N 2 O, a similar difference (− 0. 40 nmol mol − 1) was found when measuring surveillance or working gas cylinders with both instruments. This suggests that the difference observed in ambient air originates from a calibration offset that could partly be due to a difference between the WMO N 2 O X 2006 a reference scale used for the TCI and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO- 1998) scale used at Mace Head and in the whole AGAGE network.

This {{is based on the}} presence of anomalous Au concentrations and hydrothermal brecciation. Short wavelength infrared (SWIR) analysis using a portable <b>infrared</b> mineral <b>analyser</b> (PIMA) was carried out to investigate the alteration mineralogy of these deposits and compare them with Cyprus-type mineralisation. Three distinct styles of alteration are present, two represent typical Cyprus-type VHMS alteration, with acidic alteration, not previously documented in Cyprus-type VHMS deposits, being the third. A process of sub-seafloor boiling, as inferred to be occurring presently in the Lau basin, most easily explains the formation and spatial link between acidic alteration and the zones of explosive hydrothermal brecciation present in the Tourounjia and Alestos deposits. It also provides a model to account for the high Au content found in the boreholes from Tourounjia...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new device for {{continuous}} {{monitoring of the}} concentration of CO 2 dissolved in water. The device consists of a tube made of a polymeric semi-permeable membrane connected to an <b>infrared</b> gas <b>analyser</b> (IRGA) and a pump. Several laboratory experiments were performed to set the best operating condition and test the accuracy of measurements. We used the device for performing 20 months of continuous monitoring of dissolved CO 2 concentration (DCC) in groundwater within a drainage gallery at Mt. Etna. The monitored groundwater intercepts the Pernicana Fault, along which degassing is observed related to volcano-tectonic activity. The acquired data were compared with continuous and discrete data obtained using existing methods. The measurements of DCC resulted in some period of the year well correlated with air temperature. We also found that long-term trends, as well as short-term variations, are probably linked to the dynamics of volcanic activity and/or perturbations in the local or regional stress fields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{investigates the}} {{simultaneous}} production of MnO and syngas (CO + H 2) from mixtures of MnCO 3 with various waste plastics {{in a laboratory}} scale horizontal tube furnace. Cylindrical compacts of reagent grade MnCO 3 were heated rapidly with and without high density polyethylene (HDPE at C/O ratio = 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0) and {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE at C/O ratio 1. 0) for 600 s at 1150 °C under high purity argon gas and the off gas was continuously analysed for CH 4, CO and CO 2 using an online <b>infrared</b> gas <b>analyser</b> (IR). Peaks of H 2 gas were detected using a gas chromatographic analyser (GC). The results indicate that blending the carbonate with the polymers before heating has a significant attenuating effect on CO 2 emissions. It is further reported that the observed attenuation of CO 2 emissions is accompanied by a simultaneous production of syngas that can be recovered as a beneficial by-product...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{instrument for}} development of gas sensors is the test and measurement system. Whereas for calibration of commercial gas sensors prefabricated gas mixtures were often used, for research purposes a more flexible system is needed. The test system of IFT (Fraunhofer-Institute Solid State Technology) provides independent mixing of two test gases together with a humidification at a high dynamic range. The gas mixture is performed via a volumetric method. Two test chambers were developed, optimized for a small volume and a well defined gasstream. These test chambers contain simultaniously up to 1 0 sensors of different types (semiconductor, dielectric, QMB, SAW [...] .) and provide measurement of gas temperature and pressure. The exhaust gases are analysed via a dew point mirror and an optional <b>infrared</b> gas <b>analyser.</b> The article describes the main installation plan, the most important formulas for volumetric mixing systems and humidification and gives {{an example of a}} sensor measurem ent...|$|R
