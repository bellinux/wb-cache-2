5000|$|Here is {{a lovely}} film about two high school seniors who look, speak and feel like real 18-year-old middle-American human beings. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> how rare that is?

It respects its characters and doesn't use them for its own shabby purposes. How deeply we care about them. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley are so there. Being young is a solemn business when you really care about someone. Teller has a touch of John Cusack in his Say Anything period. Woodley is beautiful in a real person sort of way, studying him with concern, and then that warm smile. We have gone through senior year with these two. We have known them. We have been them.|$|E

5000|$|Brought up {{largely in}} Paris, Edma Morisot {{received}} a bourgeois education, like her sisters Yves and Berth, that included piano and drawing. All three sisters {{were encouraged to}} pursue drawing by their mother, who had them first study with the neoclassical painter Geoffroy Alphonse Chocane in 1857. Edma and Berthe both wanted to pursue their training further, which led them to take lessons under the well-regarded painter Joseph Guichard, {{a former student of}} Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. According to Armand Forreau's 1925 biography of Berthe Morisot, Guichard is said to have warned their mother: [...] "With natures like those of your daughters my teaching will not confer the meagre talent of genteel accomplishment, they will become painters. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what that means? In your milieu of the grande bourgeoisie it would be a revolution."Guichard encouraged the young women to copy paintings at the Louvre, which the two women visited chaperoned by their mother. There, they met the artist Félix Bracquemond in 1859, who introduced them to Henri Fantin-Latour. The Morisot sisters soon tired of copying the old masters, and in 1860 they began to study with the Barbizon painter Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, who taught them to paint en plein air. In 1863, when Corot became too busy to continue to instruct them, Edma and Berthe came under the tutelage of another Barbican painting, Achille François Oudinot. The sisters later broke with Oudinot on acrimonious terms, and they later referred to Corot. as their teacher who introduced them to several artists including Edouard Manet.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Data on {{urinary bladder}} cancer (UBC) patients' {{perceptions}} about causes of bladder cancer is limited, {{while this may}} be important knowledge for health prevention and education. We evaluated self-reported perceptions and beliefs {{about the causes of}} bladder cancer among UBC survivors in the Netherlands. METHODS: UBC survivors identified through the Netherlands Cancer Registry from 2007 to 2012 were invited to participate. Patients who consented were asked to fill out a questionnaire, including questions on lifestyle characteristics, occupational and medical history, and family history of cancer. The final question was 'You have been diagnosed with bladder cancer. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what may have been the cause of your cancer?'. RESULTS: Of the 1793 UBC survivors included, 366 (20 %) reported a possible cause for their bladder cancer. The most frequently reported suspected causes were smoking (10 %), occupational exposure (5 %), and heredity (2 %). Smoking, occupational exposure and heredity were mentioned only slightly more frequently by participants with these risk factors (11 %, 8 %, and 5 %, respectively) compared to the total population. CONCLUSIONS: Most UBC survivors did not suspect any cause that might have contributed to the development of their cancer. Even among participants with established risk factors for bladder cancer, these risk factors were not commonly perceived. This finding probably reflects the superficial knowledge of risk factors for bladder cancer in the population and highlights the importance of effective education on cancer prevention...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} self-reported causes of prostate cancer among prostate cancer survivors in the Netherlands to obtain insight into the common beliefs and perceptions of risk factors for prostate cancer. Materials and methods A total of 956 prostate cancer survivors, who were identified from a population-based cancer registry and provided written informed consent, completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history and family history of cancer. The final question: ‘You have been diagnosed with prostate cancer. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what may have been the cause of your cancer?’ was evaluated for this study. Results Of the 956 prostate cancer survivors, 143 participants (15 %) reported that they were aware of any factors that might have caused their prostate cancer. Participants reported factors related to heredity (37 %), environmental factors (17 %), nutrition or physical activity (13 %) and stress (13 %) as most likely causes. Interestingly, although a positive family history is established as a risk factor for prostate cancer, only 19 % of the prostate cancer survivors with an affected first-degree relative reported this as possible cause. Conclusion Relatively few prostate cancer survivors were able to report possible causes of their prostate cancer. Furthermore, established risk factors for prostate cancer were not commonly perceived, not even among men with these risk factors. This finding might be taken into account, while developing future cancer education programs. Some causal factors reported by the participants may warrant further investigation, because current evidence for their role in prostate cancer aetiology is still missing or inconclusive...|$|E
