5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} columns <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> They forage into buildings, eucalyptus trees, ground {{areas or}} on low vegetation. Workers are both diurnal and nocturnal, {{but they are}} not active throughout any 24-hour period. Low activity occurs during clear sunny days; however, colonies are extremely active shortly after rain.|$|E
5|$|Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} considered a household pest since ants can enter human homes at night <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours {{until it is}} night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly feeds on sweet secretions and sugar water; insects {{and a variety of}} foodstuffs in human homes are also consumed.|$|E
5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids. These mass movements may also be opportunistic, <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> rather than seasonal. A 2008 study of an unusually large outbreak of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in British Columbia found that beetles were capable of flying 30–110km per day in densities of up to 18, 600 beetles per hectare.|$|E

50|$|The two {{northern}} {{species are}} partially migratory, moving south in winter {{from the northern}} parts of their range, or wandering nomadically in poor vole years <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> better <b>food</b> supplies. Tropical Asio owls are largely sedentary.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{commonly}} seen in gardens. The females {{can be seen}} flying {{amongst the}} trees <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> its <b>food</b> plants, while the males are more frequently observed visiting flowers for nectar or mud-puddling. It rests with its wings closed exhibiting the brilliantly coloured underside.|$|R
5|$|The classic view {{describes}} a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> However, this applies {{to only a}} few species. Most live far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely {{to have their own}} distinct personalities. Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year. Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.|$|E
5|$|The {{remoteness}} of Dawson {{proved an}} ongoing {{problem for the}} supply of food, and as the population grew to 5,000 in 1897, this became critical. When the rivers iced over, {{it became clear that}} there would not be enough food for that winter. The NWMP evacuated some prospectors without supplies to Fort Yukon in Alaska from September 30 onwards, while others made {{their way out of the}} Klondike <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and shelter for the winter.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings {{can be very}} tame in winter, {{entering}} {{towns and}} gardens <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> rowan berries being a particular favourite. They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit, but can still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Other hazards include predation by birds of prey, infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows. The Bohemian waxwing's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
60|$|But, {{although}} Jarwin made {{light of}} his sufferings, his gaunt, wasted frame {{would have been a}} sad sight to any pitiful spectator, as with weary aspect and unsteady gait he moved about on the sandy ridge <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> more <b>food,</b> or gazed with longing eyes on the richly-wooded island.|$|R
50|$|In autumn {{the reserve}} is visited by {{migrating}} birds both heading south and those seeking {{refuge from the}} Arctic winter. These often form large flocks in the winter that gathering to feed or at dusk flying off together to form large roosts. Waxwings sometimes visit <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> winter <b>food</b> from Scandinavia.|$|R
50|$|On November 21, 2006, the Food Network premiered {{their first}} web-exclusive series, called Eat This with Dave Lieberman. Lieberman visits five United States cities {{uncovering}} trends and crazes in cuisine, including specialty meats, flavored salts, dessert bars and more. Lieberman also {{starred in the}} Yahoo! series <b>In</b> <b>Search</b> <b>of</b> Real <b>Food,</b> and <b>in</b> the PBS series, America's Heartland.|$|R
5|$|While {{shedding}} {{much of the}} blood's liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat {{still has}} added almost 20–30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air. Typically, within two hours of setting out <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> the common vampire bat returns to its roost and settles down {{to spend the rest}} of the night digesting its meal.|$|E
5|$|As {{the colonists}} fenced off more land, the Noongar were {{increasingly}} {{denied access to}} their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. <b>In</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of firestick farming: firing the bush to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E

50|$|The Lenape Native Americans {{that came}} to the area two {{thousand}} years ago from the Mississippi River valley. They traveled on the mountain <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>foods</b> and game. They collected acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts, beech nuts, chestnuts, and butternuts from the deciduous forest, and collected water from fresh streams. The Lenapes also hunted deer, elk, and bear on the mountain.|$|R
50|$|Young {{children}} are also victimized. Women {{who need to}} leave their children <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> work, <b>food,</b> or water sometimes have {{no option but to}} leave them alone or with strangers; sometimes these {{children are}} sexually abused. Human rights group Amnesty International reports that men roam the camps in groups looking for victims, targeting young girls without the protection afforded by schools and safe play areas.|$|R
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> They can use navigation skills {{to return to a}} den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|Three-year-old {{polar bear}} Mercedes {{was given to}} the zoo in 1984, after she was rescued in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. She had begun {{wandering}} into the town <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Because of the danger she posed to residents, Mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked. When she could not be persuaded to return to the wild, a decision was taken to shoot her. A member of the Edinburgh Zoological Society collaborated with a cousin in Canada {{and they were able to}} rescue Mercedes, finding her a new home at Edinburgh zoo. The bear would become one of the zoo's most popular attractions.|$|E
50|$|Females tend to fly {{closer to}} the ground <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> {{suitable}} larval <b>food</b> plants, and if already mated, will signal their unavailability in flight by raising the abdomen and lowering the wings to display the sphragis.|$|R
50|$|Mycelial cords {{are capable}} of {{conducting}} nutrients over long distances. For instance, they can transfer nutrients to a developing fruiting body, or enable wood-rotting fungi to grow through soil from an established <b>food</b> base <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> new <b>food</b> sources. For parasitic fungi, they can help spread infection by growing from established clusters to uninfected parts. The cords of some wood-rotting fungi (like Serpula lacrymans) may be capable of penetrating masonry.|$|R
50|$|They prefer clear waters {{where they}} lurk along weed edges, rock outcrops, or other {{structures}} to rest. A fish forms two distinct home ranges in summer: a shallow range and a deeper one. The shallow range is generally {{much smaller than}} the deeper range due to shallow water heating up. A muskie continually patrols the ranges <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> available <b>food</b> <b>in</b> the appropriate conditions of water temperature.|$|R
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal control {{system is to}} {{stabilize}} the system, so that {{the output of the}} system towards a steady state by minimizing the performance index. LQR-invinite horizon is a special case of LQR in thecontinuous time area where the terminal time of the performance index value for infinite time and infinite outputsystem is zero. Performance index will be affected by the weighting matrix. In this paper will be discussed about the application of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) and Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) to determine the state feedback of a closed loop system and weighting matrices in the LQR to minimize performance index. PSO algorithm is a computational algorithm inspired by social behavior of flocks of birds and fishes <b>in</b> <b>searching</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> While the DEA is an optimization algorithm that is adopted from evolution and genetics of organisms. Simulations of the PSO algorithm will be compared with DEA. Based on case study, DEA is faster then PSO to get convergence to the optimum solution...|$|R
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Native Americans living along the Columbia River as early as 10,000years ago visited the Bull Run {{watershed}} <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> Within the past few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} <b>in</b> <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals who went out to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.|$|E
