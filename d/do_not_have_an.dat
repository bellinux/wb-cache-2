In general, these hormones <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member of the immediate family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears. They do not represent a distinct taxon or systematic grouping, but rather have a polyphyletic relation due to convergent evolution, as in they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> immediate common ancestor. They are also unified by their reliance on the marine environment for feeding.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{cells have}} other enzymes that can degrade RNA, {{either from the}} 3' or from the 5' end of the RNA, the exosome complex is {{essential}} for cell survival. When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped, for example by RNA interference, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated proteins, are essential proteins. Bacteria <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> exosome complex; however, similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase, called the degradosome.|$|E
5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and most would {{generally}} be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, qwerty, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list {{are considered to be}} naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E

5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and can effectively absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of an interest {{is determined by}} {{a consideration of the}} value of something to an individual (though this is not understood purely subjectively) and the relationship between the individual at this time and the individual when he or she has the interest satisfied (see personal identity). Cochrane argues that those beings who lack personhood, including many nonhuman animals and some humans, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interest in liberty or not being used by others, and so have no prima facie right to freedom. They do, however, possess significant interests in not being made to suffer and in not being killed, and so have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer and a prima facie right not to be killed.|$|E
50|$|If <b>a</b> surface <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{tangent plane}} at <b>a</b> point, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{at that point}} either. For example, <b>a</b> cone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal at its tip nor does it <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{along the edge of}} its base. However, the normal to the cone is defined almost everywhere. In general, it is {{possible}} to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous.|$|R

In general, the {{power spectrum}} will usually be the sum of two parts: a line spectrum such as in this example, which is <b>not</b> continuous and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function, and a residue, which is absolutely continuous and does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function.|$|R

5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
