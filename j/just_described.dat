5|$|There {{are many}} different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, {{such as the}} one <b>just</b> <b>described,</b> use a {{signature}} that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.|$|E
5|$|While {{the status}} of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some {{scholars}} have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers. However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics {{that can be used to}} refer to the future via the strategies <b>just</b> <b>described.</b>|$|E

25|$|Moshe Marzouk, {{one of the}} Egyptian Jews {{executed}} in 1954 for planting bombs in Cairo {{in the service of}} Israeli Military Intelligence (the Lavon Affair) was a Karaite. Marzouk was considered a hero in Israel; however, his Karaite identity was downplayed in newspapers, which usually <b>just</b> <b>described</b> him as an Egyptian Jew. However, in 2001, the Israeli government, through the Israel Postal Authority, issued a special memorial sheet honoring him and many other Karaite Jews that gave their lives for Israel.|$|E

25|$|The {{slope of}} the tangent line to the {{squaring}} function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six {{times as fast as}} it is going to the right. The limit process <b>just</b> <b>described</b> can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of non-parametric statistics {{as opposed to the}} parametric statistics <b>just</b> <b>described.</b> For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.|$|E
25|$|The collection, {{composed}} between 1013 and 1023 (perhaps in 1021 or 1022), {{is not a}} mere compilation, but {{a revision}} of the ecclesiastical law {{from the standpoint of}} actual needs, and an attempt to reconcile various juridical antinomies or contradictions. Burchard is a predecessor of Gratian and, like the latter, was a very popular canonist in his time. He depends on the above-mentioned ninth-century collections and even added to their apocryphal documents and erroneous attributions. The two collections <b>just</b> <b>described</b> (Regino and Collectio Anselmo dedicata) were known and largely used by him. Pseudo-Isidore also furnished him more than 200 pieces. The entire collection is in Patrologia Latina, CXL.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} is not as simple if {{it is important that}} a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable. The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique <b>just</b> <b>described,</b> there is little change in the recognizability of background objects.-number will achieve both objectives, and that using a lens of different focal length will make no difference in the result. However, a lens of longer focal length may still be of some help; because of the narrower angle of view, a slight change of camera position may suffice to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.|$|E
25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics <b>just</b> <b>described</b> with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E
25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle <b>just</b> <b>described,</b> traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

It <b>just</b> <b>describes</b> the Sannyasi, his external state, his inner state.|$|R
50|$|At {{the core}} of visual testing {{is the idea that}} showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than <b>just</b> <b>describing</b> it, greatly {{increases}} clarity and understanding. Visual testing therefore requires the recording of the entire test process - capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format. Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones.|$|R
25|$|Scientific {{management}} {{may have}} exacerbated grievances among workers about oppressive or greedy management. It certainly strengthened developments that put workers at a disadvantage: {{the erosion of}} employment in developed economies via both offshoring and automation. Both were {{made possible by the}} deskilling of jobs, which was made possible by the knowledge transfer that scientific management achieved. Knowledge was transferred both to cheaper workers and from workers into tools. Jobs that once would have required craft work first transformed to semiskilled work, then unskilled. At this point the labor had been commoditized, and thus the competition between workers (and worker populations) moved closer to pure than it had been, depressing wages and job security. Jobs could be offshored (giving one human's tasks to others—which could be good for the new worker population but was bad for the old) or they could be rendered nonexistent through automation (giving a human's tasks to machines). Either way, the net result from the perspective of developed-economy workers was that jobs started to pay less, then disappear. The power of labor unions in the mid-twentieth century only led to a push on the part of management to accelerate the process of automation, hastening the onset of the later stages <b>just</b> <b>described.</b>|$|E

500|$|Nature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept {{inspired}} by the Stoic philosophy which underlies much of his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: [...] "nature, that is life" [...] is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, [...] "for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things". This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and {{is crucial to the}} understanding of the Natural History. The components of nature are not <b>just</b> <b>described</b> in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, painting and jewellery. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern ecological theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.|$|E

500|$|The first {{reconstruction}} {{was given}} by Buckland himself. He considered Megalosaurus to be a quadruped. He {{thought it was an}} [...] "amphibian", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind Megalosaurus resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that Megalosaurus would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that <b>just</b> <b>described.</b> Today, this is known to have belonged to Iguanodon, or at least some iguanodontid, but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to Megalosaurus also. Even taking into account the effects of allometry, heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of Megalosaurus at sixty to seventy feet. The existence of Megalosaurus posed some problems for christian orthodoxy, which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin, which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre-Adamitic phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the Bridgewater Treatises that Megalosaurus had played a beneficial rôle in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, [...] "to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering".|$|E
