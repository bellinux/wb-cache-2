50|$|C. roseus is used {{in plant}} {{pathology}} as an experimental host for phytoplasmas. This is because {{it is easy to}} <b>infect</b> <b>with</b> a large majority of phytoplasmas, and also often has very distinctive symptoms such as phyllody and significantly reduced leaf size.|$|R

5000|$|Research {{carried out}} at Imperial College London has shown that, unlike {{seasonal}} flu, H1N1/09 can infect cells deep in the lungs. Seasonal flu can only <b>infect</b> cells <b>with</b> receptor type a2-6 which are typically located in the nose and throat but H1N1/09 can also <b>infect</b> cells <b>with</b> receptor type a2-3. This may explain why some patients experience severe respiratory symptoms. (The H5N1 virus is also able to infect cells deep in the lungs with receptor type a2-3 but cannot <b>infect</b> cells <b>with</b> receptor type a2-6 making it less contagious than H1N1/09.) ...|$|R
5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's {{population}} has been <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> HIV.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of insects}} for warfare {{may have been}} {{attempted}} in the Middle Ages or earlier, but was first systematically researched by several nations during the twentieth century. It was put into practice by the Japanese army's Unit 731 in attacks on China during the Second World War, killing almost 500,000 Chinese people with fleas <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> plague and flies <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> cholera. Also in the Second World War, the Germans explored the use of Colorado beetles to destroy enemy potato crops. During the Cold War, the US Army considered using yellow fever mosquitoes to attack Soviet cities.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|About 90% {{of those}} <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> M. {{tuberculosis}} have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease.

5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern goshawk increased 25-fold if the prey was <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat {{is dark and}} stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E
50|$|FMD can be {{contracted}} by contact <b>with</b> <b>infected</b> meat, <b>with</b> meat on {{the bone}} representing {{a higher risk}} than filleted meat. As a result, import of {{meat on the bone}} remains more restricted than that of filleted meat in many countries.|$|R
25|$|Pasteur's {{later work}} on {{diseases}} included work on chicken cholera. He received cultures from Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint, and cultivated them in chicken broth. During this work, {{a culture of}} the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was <b>infecting</b> <b>with</b> the disease. Upon reusing these healthy chickens, Pasteur discovered he could not <b>infect</b> them, even <b>with</b> fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease, though they had caused only mild symptoms.|$|R

5|$|Changes in {{ecosystem}} biological diversity, {{evolution of}} parasites, and invasion by exotic species all frequently result in disease outbreaks such as cholera which emerged in 1992 in India.

5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults {{of which are}} found in the nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods include}} {{starting}} with disease free plants, buying cultivars {{that are less}} susceptible to Raspberry Spur Blight such as Brandywine, Killarney, Latham and Newburgh, and avoiding cultivars that have greater susceptibility such as Royalty, Titan, Canby, Skeena, Willamette, Reveille, and Sentry. Willamette readily <b>infects</b> <b>with</b> spur blight but is tolerant to the disease and still produces satisfactory yields.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae {{into the central}} nervous system is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E

The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> it for prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work more closely with the colonists in the hope of being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by car bomb before his duplicity was discovered.|$|E
