50|$|Ahead of the torpedoes on PT-109 {{were two}} depth charges, omitted on most PTs, {{one on each}} side, about the same {{diameter}} as the torpedoes. These were designed to be used against submarines, but were sometimes used by PT commanders to confuse and discourage pursuing destroyers. At one point, the port Mark 6 depth charge was knocked through the foredeck by the port forward torpedo when the torpedo was inadvertently launched while PT 109 maneuvered in high seas during a storm with Kennedy's squadron commander, Lt. Alvin Cluster, at the wheel. Cluster had asked Kennedy for a turn at PT 109's wheel, as he had only had experience with the older, Elco 77-foot PTs.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{optimization}} of rocket combustion chamber walls {{with respect to}} the life time is presented. This method can be split into four main parts: P 1) Determination of the thermal field within the combustion chamber wall and the cooling channel during the <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> phase by a steady state thermo-fluid mechanical analysis. P 2) Analysis of the nonlinear deformation of the combustion chamber wall under cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. P 3) Estimation of the life time of the combustion chamber wall by a post processing method. P 4) Application of a mathematical optimization procedure. This strategy is used to analyse the thermal load induced deformation process and life time of a typical rocket combustion chamber and to optimise selected geometry parameters of the combustion chamber wall. As one of the objectives of the presented work is a recommendation for the choice of a suitable and efficient optimization procedure for the given problem class, two different methods are compared: A standard Conjugate Gradient method and an efficient gradient free optimization procedure...|$|E
40|$|To {{predict the}} thermal and {{structural}} {{responses of the}} thrust chamber wall under cyclic work, a 3 -D fluid-structural coupling computational methodology is developed. The thermal and mechanical loads are determined by a validated 3 -D finite volume fluid-thermal coupling computational method. With the specified loads, the nonlinear thermal-structural finite element analysis is applied to obtaining the 3 -D thermal and structural responses. The Chaboche nonlinear kinematic hardening model calibrated by experimental data is adopted to predict the cyclic plastic behavior of the inner wall. The methodology is further applied to the thrust chamber of LOX/Methane rocket engines. The results show that both the maximum temperature at <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> phase and the maximum circumferential residual strain of the inner wall appear at the convergent part of the chamber. Structural analysis for multiple work cycles reveals that {{the failure of the}} inner wall may be controlled by the low-cycle fatigue when the Chaboche model parameter γ 3  =  0, and the damage caused by the thermal-mechanical ratcheting of the inner wall cannot be ignored when γ 3  >  0. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that mechanical loads have a strong influence on the strains in the inner wall...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{systems are}} an {{essential}} key for efficient future space transportation systems (STS) and {{the feasibility of}} advanced vehicle design concepts. Beside efficiency, safe and reliable operations at significant reduced costs are a fundamental request {{to any kind of}} future propulsion system and STS, respectively. Today’s regenerative cooled cryogenic thrust chambers rely on a metallic design and they are highly optimized thus showing only minor improvement potential. An approach followed by DLR since some years is the realization of a revolutionary thrust chamber concept based on effusion cooling and use of high performance composites and porous ceramic matrix composites (CMC). Various functional demonstrators named V 01 -V 03 were tested at the M 3 test facility of DLR at the site of Lampoldshausen at typical combustion pressure levels of approximately 1 MPa. A recent test campaign of an entire effusion cooled C/C thrust chamber contour at the European high-pressure H 2 /O 2 test facility P 8 in Lampoldshausen demonstrated successfully the functionality of this technology approach at relevant pressure levels up to 8 MPa and typical <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> test durations of 60 seconds. Summarizing the results achieved so far throughout this campaign an important development milestone and breakthrough of this new thrust chamber concept could be reached. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) - test bench is {{discussed}} in this paper. Motivation for the TMF tests are two-fold: to assess the life expectation of structures being exposed to extreme thermo-mechanical loads first on subcomponent or panel level, and to serve as validation experiment for life-prediction models. In Europe, the concept of TMF-panel testing has been first very successfully applied to rocket thrust chamber structures {{in the frame of}} the Ariane 5 Flight Recovery Programme in 2003 and 2004. These encouraging results have motivated the partners DLR Lampoldshausen and EADS Astrium to jointly investigate again the TMF-bench concept with special focus on meeting relevant requirements for future liquid propulsion needs. The following key elements of a TMF test bench are presented in the paper: • the TMF heating device – a diode Laser, which is available already at DLR Lampoldshausen, • the design of the panel housing, • a tentative design of the TMF panel. Furthermore, numerical analyses of this tentative TMF panel – such as a CFD analysis of the coolant flow in the core part of the TMF panel and a thermal as well as a structural Finite Element analysis of the sandwich part of the TMF panel during the <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> are shown...|$|E
40|$|Since summer 2001 the DLR test {{facility}} P 5 in Lampoldshausen, Germany looks back on {{ten years of}} testing the ARIANE 5 main engine VULCAIN on engine level. A few months prior the identical facility PF 50 at SNECMA in Vernon, France already had this anniversary. During this period the test facilities had to fulfil quite various requirements for the engine tests. The principle task of the facilities was always to simulate the conditions on the launcher to the VULCAIN engine. The environment and all interfaces of the rocket motor were achieved to match this target. Small and vast modifications of the test facilities were performed to evaluate the engine behaviour under standard and special conditions, expected and unexpected phenomena were detected and investigated. The schedule of pre-test and post-test operations for a <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> has in principle not changed yet the different steps were optimised due to {{the increasing number of}} objectives per test, a high desired cadence of tests, due to adding other flight hardware to the tested specimen and due to the basic request of maintaining a high level of quality and safety. It was mandatory to optimise and to create new procedures for consequent application in order to reach a high level of reliability of the facilities and to guarantee a high level of availability despite all non avoidable anomalies. Both test facilities will also be available for future developments of the VULCAIN engine. In their design concept it is foreseen that the facilities can be modified up to a configuration in which twin engines of 200 kN thrust each can be tested. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of currently available 10 MPa combustion chambers, hot gas pressures of up to 25 MPa are desirable. As such high pressures lead to an increased heat transfer from the hot gas into the combustion chamber wall, alternative cooling methods to the conventional regenerative cooling are required. One of the most promising alternative cooling approaches is effusion cooling. DLR has been working {{for the last few years}} in the field of effusion technology. Experiments performed at DLR Lampoldshausen have demonstrated the capability of carbon fibre / carbon matrix (C/C) composite materials to perform well in model combustion chambers [4],[6]. For previous analyses with the CFD-program ANSYS/FLOTRAN [5],[7], the -kε turbulence model was chosen. These analyses were restricted to the usage of a globally specified value for the specific heat capacity for all the involved species. In this contribution, improved analyses of effusion cooled combustion chambers with the CFD-program ANSYS/CFX are shown, taking into account the correct values of the specific heat capacity for each of the involved species. These analyses are based on the following principles: (1) 1 -degree 3 D model (quasi 2 D axisymmetric) (2) solution of the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations (3) coupled analysis of the hot gas and the coolant flow („multi species“) (4) compressible flow (5) SST turbulence model (with different parameter settings in the hot gas area and the porous chamber wall) (6) „distributed resistance“ model according to Forchheimer inside the porous chamber wall The CFD analysis of the stationary <b>hot</b> <b>run</b> of the engine simultaneously models the hot gas flow in the combustion chamber and the coolant flow in the porous chamber wall. The detailed analysis of the combustion itself is avoided by defining the injector plate of the combustion chamber as an inlet of the hot by-product of the combustion (steam). A good comparison between the experimentally and the numerically obtained mass flow rates can be obtained by fitting the turbulence parameters in the area of the porous medium...|$|E
