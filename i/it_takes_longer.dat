5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E

25|$|The rough side tears {{hold the}} air {{more easily than}} the shiny side valleys, so to {{maintain}} the air within the valleys the initial air layer must {{have a very high}} velocity, which is why reverse swing is primarily, but not necessarily, achieved by fast bowlers. Due to the less static nature of the initial air layer <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> for the swing to occur, which is why it occurs later in the delivery. This is why conventional and reverse swing can occur in the same delivery.|$|E
25|$|The sketch as {{originally}} {{depicted in the}} series begins with John Cleese playing a nameless civil servant who, after purchasing The Times from the newsagent in the previous sketch, walks {{through the streets of}} London (at the crossing of Thorpebank Road and Dunraven Road) in a very peculiar manner. He eventually arrives at his place of business: The Ministry of Silly Walks, on the northern end of Whitehall. In the hallway, he passes other employees all exhibiting their own silly walks before arriving at his office (the Hollywood Bowl performance omits this preamble). Once there, he finds Mr Putey (Michael Palin) waiting for him and apologizes for the delay, explaining that his walk has become particularly silly of late and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> for him to reach his destination.|$|E
25|$|The {{tropical}} maritime airmass (MT) {{is responsible}} for Nigeria's rainy season. This wind (the tropical maritime airmass) invades the country from February {{in the southern part}} of Nigeria while <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country, reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June. Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat, of the tropical continental airmass (CT) known as the harmattan. The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass (CT), is caused by the sun's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere. This shift begins from February and ends in June, when the sun is fully overhead, at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|Vesicles in {{the nerve}} {{terminal}} are grouped into three pools: the readily releasable pool, the recycling pool, and the reserve pool. These pools are distinguished by their function and {{position in the}} nerve terminal. The readily releasable pool are docked to the cell membrane, making these {{the first group of}} vesicles to be released on stimulation. The readily releasable pool is small and is quickly exhausted. The recycling pool is proximate to the cell membrane, and tend to be cycled at moderate stimulation, so that the rate of vesicle release is the same as, or lower than, the rate of vesicle formation. This pool is larger than the readily releasable pool, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> to become mobilised. The reserve pool contains vesicles that are not released under normal conditions. This reserve pool can be quite large (~50%) in neurons grown on a glass substrate, but is very small or absent at mature synapses in intact brain tissue.|$|E
25|$|At {{the highest}} level, the design may be {{optimized}} to make {{best use of}} the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, {{a system that is}} network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a modular system may allow rewrite of only some component – for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at the design level, and may be difficult to change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).|$|E

500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family.

2500|$|Ideally, {{the length}} of a horse's back from the peak of the withers to the point of the hip should be 1/3 of the horse's overall body length [...] (from the point of the {{shoulder}} to the point of the buttock, excluding head and neck). [...] A horse's back is called [...] "long" [...] if the length exceeds 1/3 and [...] "short" [...] if less than 1/3. Long backs are more often seen in [...] "gaited" [...] horses, such as Saddlebreds or Tennessee Walkers. They are sometimes, but not always, associated with long, weak loins. [...] The advantage to a long back is that it is flexible, making the movement of the back flatter, quieter, and makes a smoother ride. [...] Even horses that are not gaited often have a smoother trot and long strides, making them comfortable to ride. On the other hand, it makes it harder for the horse to lift or [...] "round" [...] the back to develop speed or engage the hindquarters for high levels of collection. [...] <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> to develop the muscles in a long back, and they are more prone to muscular strain and swayback as they age.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} usually rely on uranium to {{fuel the}} chain reaction. [...] Uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on Earth and is found in sea water {{as well as most}} rocks. [...] Naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes: uranium-238 (U-238), accounting for 99.3% and uranium-235 (U-235) accounting for about 0.7%. [...] Isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons. [...] Thus, U-238 has 146 neutrons and U-235 has 143 neutrons. [...] Different isotopes have different behaviors. [...] For instance, U-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy. [...] On the other hand, U-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element. [...] Different isotopes also have different half-lives. [...] A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay. [...] U-238 has a longer half-life than U-235, so <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> to decay over time. [...] This also means that U-238 is less radioactive than U-235.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the triboelectric effect. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates {{a great amount of}} static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>longer</b> to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. Conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static electric generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.|$|E

2500|$|Since Article Three of the United States Constitution {{stipulates}} that federal courts may only entertain [...] "cases" [...] or [...] "controversies", the Supreme Court cannot decide {{cases that are}} moot {{and it does not}} render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do.
