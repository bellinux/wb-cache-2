25|$|A gift {{is taken}} when a <b>donee</b> becomes beneficially {{entitled}} in possession to some property without paying full consideration for it. Tax is payable within {{four months of}} {{the date of the}} gift; an interest charge applies to late payments.|$|E
25|$|The person {{providing}} {{the property is}} called the donor or disponer, or testator or deceased {{in the case of}} inheritance; the person receiving the property is called the beneficiary, <b>donee</b> or disponee, or the successor in the case of inheritance.|$|E
25|$|When {{a person}} {{receives}} a gift or inheritance that, either by itself, or aggregated with prior benefits {{taken by the}} <b>donee,</b> would place him {{in a position of}} having used up more than 80% of any group threshold, he must complete form IT38 and return it to Revenue within four months, along with any tax due.|$|E
40|$|Altruistically {{motivated}} gifts {{involve a}} species of consumption externality. Donors obtain an altruistic benefit from the effect of their gifts on donees' utility but do {{not take into account}} that the benefit to <b>donees</b> is itself relevant to social welfare. The level of gift-giving thus will be lower than is optimal. A subsidy can correct this problem, while compulsory transfers (assuming the state lacks information about who is altruistic) and bargaining between donors and <b>donees</b> cannot. The rationale for subsidizing gifts offered here does not depend on whether the <b>donee's</b> activity is a public good (as with gifts for medical research) or whether the transfer tends to equalize the wealth of donors and <b>donees</b> [...] factors emphasized in the existing literature on the subject. ...|$|R
50|$|All {{but four}} captaincies failed, due to {{inadequate}} {{resources of the}} <b>donees</b> and lack {{of support from the}} Crown. Four <b>donees</b> failed to take possession of their lands, and four more quickly succumbed to Indians. Only four captaincies survived past 1549: São Vicente, Pernambuco, Ilhéus and Porto Seguro.|$|R
5000|$|Also notable are {{the last}} names of the <b>donees,</b> which {{indicate}} that these were not hereditary surnames in the 10th century. The <b>donees</b> had two different last names - [...] "Upadhyaya" [...] and [...] "Dikshita" [...] - although both were Nagar Brahmins from same locality and gotra, being a father-son duo.|$|R
25|$|Grants: The king {{occasionally}} gave Brahmanas grants (brahmadeya), {{which consisted}} generally of villages, water resources, wastelands etc. (agraharas). Such grants conferred on the <b>donee</b> {{the right to}} collect revenue {{and the right to}} be free of any regular tax himself and immunity from other harassments. Sometimes, the Brahmanas were relocated from North India, with a view to establish varnashramdharma. Nevertheless, the existence of donees indicate the existence of a feudal class. Grants made to temples and religious institutions were called dharmottara and devottara respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of Ottaway v Norman [...] Ch., Brightman J held that a {{floating}} obligation attaches to secret trusts: [...] "A valid trust is created in favour of the secondary <b>donee</b> which is in suspense during the lifetime of the <b>donee,</b> but attaches to the estate of the primary <b>donee</b> {{at the moment of}} the latter's death." [...] Edward Nugee QC sitting as deputy High Court judge in Re Basham [...] 1 WLR applied a comparable test in relation to proprietary estoppel. He held that the belief, for detrimental reliance, need not relate to a clearly identified piece of property. Following Cleaver and Birmingham, if it is established by cogent evidence that the intention was to leave the entire estate, proprietary estoppel will enforce that intention. (It is interesting to recall that Edward Nugee was counsel in Ottaway v Norman and that Brightman J adopted his floating obligation theory) ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 1681, the Marquis de Cascais, the <b>donee</b> of the Captaincy of São Vicente, {{moved the}} capital {{to the village of}} St. Paul, {{designating}} it the [...] "Head of the captaincy." [...] The new capital was established on April 23, 1683, with public celebrations.|$|E
40|$|Although {{contracts}} are generally irrevocable, the donor may revoke the donation contract {{due to the}} <b>donee's</b> ingratitude. Such circumstances gives rise to an inevitable dispute between the contracting parties, which is commonly resolved in civil litigation proceedings. Given the fact that formal sources of law cannot predict all forms of <b>donee's</b> ingratitude, courts have a creative role in revocation lawsuits. While trying to fill unavoidable legislative gaps, the courts of the former Yugoslav republics have developed the legal standard of 'gross ingratitude', which has been successfully used in the judicial practice. This paper focuses on 24 judgments dealing with different aspects of <b>donee's</b> ingratitude: the relationship between ingratitude and criminal liability; the degrees of ingratitude; the <b>donee's</b> omission which is detrimental to the donor; ingratitude manifested {{over a longer period}} of time; and revocation provoked by interference of third parties...|$|R
50|$|Nothing {{connected}} the <b>donees</b> (or the old corporation) to the donors (and their new corporation). The gifts were made, without any legal or moral obligation, {{not for any}} consideration or for services rendered, but as acts of spontaneous generosity in appreciation of past loyalty of the <b>donees</b> which had benefited the donors when stockholders of the older company.|$|R
5000|$|In many instances, {{an estate}} {{planning}} {{strategy is to}} give the maximum amount possible to {{as many people as possible}} to reduce the size of the estate, the effectiveness of which depends on the lifespan of the donor and the number of <b>donees.</b> (This also gives the <b>donees</b> immediate use of the assets, while the donor is alive to see them enjoy it.) ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>donee</b> {{beneficiary}} can sue the promisor {{directly to}} enforce the promise. (Seaver v. Ransom, 224 NY 233, 120 NE 639 1918). A <b>donee</b> beneficiary is when a contract is made expressly for giving a gift to a third party, the third party {{is known as the}} <b>donee</b> beneficiary. The most common <b>donee</b> beneficiary contract is a life insurance policy.|$|E
50|$|Conditional gifts can be revoked {{based on}} (1) <b>donee</b> not full-filling the {{conditions}} (2) {{breach of contract}} by donor such as an engagement ring and in this case, the <b>donee</b> keeps the gift.|$|E
5000|$|Tuition {{or medical}} {{expenses}} one pays {{directly to a}} medical or educational institution for someone. Donor must pay the expense directly. If donor writes a check to <b>donee</b> and <b>donee</b> then pays the expense, the gift {{may be subject to}} tax.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{those who}} are bound to {{recognise}} and continue the lease, now that the Roman-Dutch Law principle that lease takes precedence over sale (huur gaat voor koop) has been adopted, Van Leeuwen mentions purchasers and <b>donees,</b> while Voet lists [...] "usufructuaries, legatees, <b>donees</b> and the like successors on particular title," [...] and says that their position {{is in no way}} distinguished from that of purchasers.|$|R
5000|$|Duty {{cannot be}} charged where {{property}} is left outside the province to beneficiaries who are neither resident nor domiciled in the province. Taken as a whole, chargeability to succession duty depended upon whether the donor's domicile, the <b>donee's</b> residence, {{as well as}} the <b>donee's</b> status at the date of the deceased's death and the date of the disposition of the estate. In 1967, Ontario published a table outlining the various effects: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{commission}} {{provides guidance}} for {{political parties and}} regulated <b>donees</b> {{to assist them in}} meeting their legal obligations to follow party funding rules.|$|R
50|$|The <b>donee</b> {{must accept}} the gift {{in order for}} the {{property}} transfer to take place. However, because people generally accept gifts, acceptance will be presumed, so long as the <b>donee</b> does not expressly reject the gift. A rejection of the gift destroys the gift, so that a <b>donee</b> cannot revive a once-rejected gift by later accepting it. In order for such an acceptance to be effective, the donor would have to extend the offer of the gift again.|$|E
50|$|A {{special power}} of {{appointment}} may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If exclusive, the <b>donee</b> can appoint all the property {{to one or more}} members of the class of permissible appointees to the exclusion of {{the other members of the}} class. If nonexclusive, the <b>donee</b> must appoint some property to each object.|$|E
50|$|NCRP {{was founded}} in 1976 by the <b>Donee</b> Group, a {{coalition}} of nonprofit leaders across the nation who asserted that traditional philanthropy was falling short of addressing critical public needs. The <b>Donee</b> Group {{grew out of the}} Filer Commission, which was initiated by John D. Rockefeller III in 1973 to study philanthropic giving.|$|E
50|$|This {{part of the}} {{inscription}} records the grants of two villages in Mohadavasaka vishaya (district) to a father-son duo. The <b>donees</b> were Nagar Brahmins of Anandapura, who belonged to the Gopali gotra.|$|R
50|$|On both approaches, even if {{neither the}} lessee {{nor anyone else}} holding under or through him is in occupation, a short lease is {{effective}} against heirs, legatees, <b>donees</b> and other gratuitous particular successors.|$|R
50|$|Political {{parties and}} {{regulated}} <b>donees</b> {{are required to}} submit reports of all donations they receive to the commission. The commission maintains a publicly available and searchable register of these donations on its website.|$|R
5000|$|Intention of donor to {{give the}} gift to the <b>donee</b> (donative intent) ...|$|E
50|$|When a donor {{makes an}} {{imperfect}} gift during his lifetime, and the <b>donee</b> is subsequently appointed as the donor's executor or becomes the donor's administrator on intestacy, the gift is perfected because the <b>donee</b> obtains legal {{title to the}} donor's property, including {{the subject matter of}} the intended gift, in the donee's capacity as executor or administrator.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Donee</b> {{beneficiary}} - e.g., when Andrew {{wishes to}} make a gift to Charlie and Andrew agrees to provide some consideration to Bethany in exchange for her promise to pay Charlie {{the amount of the}} gift. Under old common law principles, the <b>donee</b> beneficiary actually had a greater claim to the benefits this created, but such distinctions have been abolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{commission}} {{conducts a}} wide variety of research into electoral administration, electoral registration and the integrity and transparency of party finance, and a variety of guidance materials for political parties, regulated <b>donees</b> and electoral administrators.|$|R
50|$|Mohadavasaka (the {{district}} {{in which the}} donated villages were located) is identified with present-day Modasa. The villages - Kumbharotaka and Sihaka - are identified with the modern villages of Kamrod and Sika. Anandapura, the native place of the <b>donees,</b> is identified with Vadnagar.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s and 1890s {{many states}} passed {{inheritance}} taxes, which taxed the <b>donees</b> on {{the receipt of}} their inheritance. While many objected to the application of an inheritance tax, some including Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller supported increases in the taxation of inheritance.|$|R
5000|$|In case 1 above, {{the donor}} {{must have done}} {{everything}} necessary to be done which is within his own power {{to do in order}} to transfer the gifted asset to the <b>donee.</b> If the donor has not done so, the gift is incomplete since the <b>donee</b> has no equity to perfect an imperfect gift, for which there is a long line of authority. [...] Moreover, the court will not give a benevolent construction so as to treat ineffective words of outright gift as taking effect as if the donor had declared himself a trustee for the <b>donee,</b> see Milroy v Lord (1862) 4 De G F & J 264.|$|E

50|$|The <b>donees</b> are {{individually}} {{named as}} is their caste affiliation: brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya or śūdra. This {{is one of}} the first inscriptions in India to specifically list the four varṇa-s. The implications of this are explored by Michael Willis in his book The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual.|$|R
50|$|The Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 {{granted the}} Electoral Commission {{a variety of}} new {{supervisory}} and investigatory powers. It fills significant gaps in the commission's current powers, the Act also provides a new range of flexible civil sanctions, both financial and non-financial are currently proposed to extend to regulated <b>donees</b> as well as political parties.|$|R
50|$|The Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation funded a legal {{analysis}} to allow First Nations {{to be eligible}} recipients of grants from foundations. Often, charities were unsure {{of whether or not}} they were legally allowed to make grants to First Nations and aboriginal organizations. The analysis supported by the Foundation led to a clarification of First Nations as legal <b>donees</b> under Canada Revenue Agency's Income Tax Act.|$|R
