We present an extended study conducted using custom-grown, matched modulation-doped n-type and p-type heterostructures, with/without <b>insulated</b> <b>gates,</b> aimed at understanding {{the origin of the}} hysteresis. We show the hysteresis is not due to the inherent `leakiness' of gates on p-type heterostructures, as commonly believed. Instead, hysteresis arises from a combination of GaAs surface-state trapping and charge migration in the doping layer. Our results provide insights into the physics of Si acceptors in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, including widely-debated acceptor complexes such as Si-X. We propose methods for mitigating the gate hysteresis, including poisoning the modulation-doping layer with deep-trapping centers (e. g., by co-doping with transition metal species), and replacing the Schottky gates with degenerately-doped semiconductor gates to screen the conducting channel from GaAs surface-states.

Graphene devices also require <b>insulating</b> <b>gates.</b> We demonstrate a unique direct growth approach to obtain the bottom gate structure (graphene/HfO$_ 2 $/n-SiC). The present approach involves transfer of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Cu to oxidized Si wafers, a complex process prone to low yield and reduced performance. Furthermore, HfO$_ 2 $ is preferred to SiO$_ 2 $ because of its superior properties. The proposed concept consists of the direct deposition of graphene by solid carbon molecular beam epitaxy on Hf metal coated n-type SiC, followed by oxygen intercalation to form HfO$_ 2 $. The oxygen intercalation will then convert the underlying Hf into HfO$_ 2 $ due to the strong affinity of Hf with oxygen.
