40|$|A {{case study}} of the thermal control {{subsystem}} development for a space based payload is presented from the concept stage through preliminary design. This payload, the Space Acceleration Measurement System 2 (SAMS- 2), will measure the acceleration environment at select locations within the International Space Station. Its thermal control subsystem must maintain component temperatures within an acceptable range over a 10 year life span, while restricting accessible surfaces to touch temperature limits and insuring <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> <b>conditions</b> {{in the event of}} loss of cooling. In addition to these primary design objectives, system level requirements and constraints are imposed on the payload, many of which are driven by multidisciplinary issues. Blending these issues into the overall system design required concurrent design sessions with the project team, iterative conceptual design layouts, thermal analysis and modeling, and hardware testing. Multiple tradeoff studies were also performed to investigate the many options which surfaced during the development cycle...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the filming}} of Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick learned that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe,</b> a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot {{resemblance}} would damage his films box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel Fail-Safe (on which the film is based) is so similar to Red Alert that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court. What worried Kubrick most was that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into <b>Fail</b> <b>Safes</b> production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: [...] "We started casting. Fonda was already set ... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter the screenwriter was set ... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Main Rotor Hub {{is a very}} {{critical}} component of the helicopter considering that its failure may determine catastrophic consequences for the whole rotorcraft. A complete experimental and numerical analysis is so necessary to certificate the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> and eventually the damage tolerant behavior of the component. In this paper the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> behavior of a composite titanium-graphite Rotor Hub is analyzed. The component, with artificial technological defects, was tested with complex contingent fatigue load in order to cause {{the failure of the}} titanium section. The failure started in proximity of a high stressed area and it propagated quickly in the whole titanium section but without involve the surrounding filament winding graphite, that is a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> device. The behavior of the hub during the whole test is simulated, with good accuracy, by means of a complete FE model that reproduces also the 3 D propagation of the crack in the titanium section...|$|R
