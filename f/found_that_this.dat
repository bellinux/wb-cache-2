5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that the}} crew of the train had not been advised that there was a raised fire risk at the time. WCRC was found not to have co-operated fully with the investigation. The ADC found that WCRC's Safety Management System was deficient due to confusion over whether or not {{the crew of the}} train had been informed of the increased fire risk. WCRC failed to inform Network Rail of its plans to try to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. The ADC <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was in breach of WCRC's Safety Management System. WCRC chairman David Smith instructed his staff that no further correspondence would be gone into over the matter. The ADC <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> instruction was prejudicial to the safe operation of WCRC's Safety Management System. The instruction was later rescinded. WCRC was also found to be in breach of its Track Access Contract.|$|E

5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a redefinition of the genus.|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin.

While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was already done.

Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel (or help expel) the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E

5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a throwback to the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E

5|$|Phoenix {{was joined}} {{soon after the}} {{surrender}} of Argo by the 74gun ship of the line HMS Powerful under Captain William O'Bryen Drury and together the ships took possession of the frigate while the chase of {{the remainder of the}} Batavian squadron continued. At 10:00 two of the brigs turned towards the Batavian coastline to seek shelter and two of the leading British ships, Pegasus and the 50gun HMS Leander under Captain Maurice Delgarno, turned in chase. Donnelly sought to interpose his ships between the brigs and the coast, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would have slowed his vessels so much that the Batavian brigs would have an opportunity to escape. He therefore maintained pursuit and watched the Batavian ships, Gier and Echo driven ashore at the Batavian village of Bosch. Sailing as close to the shore line as safely possible, Delgarno detached cutters to investigate the state of the grounded ships, determining that one had been damaged beyond repair while the other, having initially grounded, had been driven over the shoal into deeper water on the far side. In his report on the action, Duncan considered that a storm which swept the area on the day following the action probably drove the brig back onto the shoal and destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{was the same as}} the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mycale, the Allied fleet {{sailed to}} the Hellespont {{to break down}} the pontoon bridges, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> had already been done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians {{remained}} to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region. Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia, who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges. The Persian governor, Artayctes had not prepared for a siege, not believing that the Allies would attack. The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos. The siege dragged on for several months, causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops, but eventually, when the food ran out in the City, the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city. The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the {{introduction of}} the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was due to an asymmetric effect of the {{introduction of the}} euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the {{introduction of the euro}}. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
