An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854).

5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> vertigo.|$|E

Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents <b>in</b> high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> parents <b>in</b> low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission.

The delivery of service quality to customers requires a congruence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customers and the providers of service. The aim of this research is to examine if there are any statistically significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> received service between the three major groups i. e. the customers, the staff and the managers of travel agencies. The information was gathered by means of a mail survey.
