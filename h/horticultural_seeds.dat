The site began construction in 2011 and is maintained by Kew’s <b>horticultural</b> staff. <b>Seed</b> production is focused on species {{that are difficult to}} obtain on the commercial market, due to harvesting, germination, or processing difficulties. Species are often regenerated to create a large collection of seeds of a particular UK provenance, such as the South Downs’ Primula veris (cowslip), or from a particular environmental habitat. The site is also open to the public as part of a visit to Wakehurst, and provides a useful environment to observe and photograph plant pollinators.|$|R

40|$|Four {{commercial}} seed lots from the Polish seed companies of pansy (Viola x wittrockiana Gams) with low germination capacity were sorted into 2 size fractions: small and large: below 4 mm long and above 4 mm and 3 colour fractions: yellow, brown and dark, using hands and colour catalogue of British Royal <b>Horticultural</b> Society. The <b>seeds</b> were then tested for their germination following the ISTA routine rules. The seed size {{did not affect}} neither its energy nor capacity of germination. In one of the seed lots, smaller seeds germinated slightly better than the big ones, but in the two others ones, it was opposite. The smaller seed also gave higher amount of abnormal seedlings in the tests. There was a clear effect of seed colour on the seeds' germination. The dark seeds had the highest germination capacity, whereas the yellow ones - the lowest. The carried out experiments proved that color sorting of pansy seeds can improve their germination, mostly due to eliminating light, immature seeds...|$|R

($ 0. 07 / lb.). ● Virginia ranked 16 th of 18 watermelon-growing states, accounting for 0. 73 % {{of the national}} watermelon production in 2001. Production Regions The largest amount of watermelon acreage, slightly less than 1, 000 acres in 2002, is located in Southampton County. Other watermelon-producing areas include the Eastern Shore, Northern Neck, and Richmond/Hanover County. Each of these areas accounts for a few hundred acres annually.

40|$|Abstract: To {{assess the}} {{economic}} impact of watershed development programmes in a traditional semi arid subtropical rainfed agro ecosystem of Bhilwara district in Rajasthan, 40 farmers each in watershed and Non- watershed areas were interviewed five years after the watershed works were completed. Balesariya watershed development programme increased ground water availability by 1. 5 m to 1. 8 m above the previous water level. <b>Horticultural</b> crops including <b>seed</b> spices like cumin, coriander and chilli (dry) and vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower and tomato and perennial tree fruit like aonla were compared for their performance along with traditional dryland crops like mustard, taramira, chickpea (gram), green gram, black gram, horse gram and sorghum + red gram (3 : 1 ratio) under watershed and non watershed conditions for their yields and economic returns. Crop yields and net profits increased in all the commodities when they were raised in a watershed. Inclusion of horticultural crops in the system yielded more returns than traditional crops in a watershed area on a sustainable basis. A net profit of Rs 100, 500 / ha was realized by growing cumin with 2 — 3 irrigations in a watershed...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} political significance of nineteenth-century domestic literature by situating {{it within the}} overlapping cultural and scientific histories of plants. While scholars have largely understood the gardens and plants of nineteenth-century American literature as metaphors for and projections of human experience, I demonstrate {{the ways in which}} literary authors, like the cultures in which they wrote, understood plants to be distinct. The writers considered here [...] Lydia Maria Child, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Emily Dickinson [...] examine how botanical life challenged the categorical systems and geographical boundaries that organized political thought and practice. I read canonical literary texts alongside home garden manuals, <b>horticultural</b> club records, <b>seed</b> catalogs, herbariums, botany textbooks, and popular periodicals to reveal how the discursive and material practices of domestic horticulture prove to be surprisingly international in scope and political in nature. My study is the first to offer a sustained examination of the way domestic writers invoked plant science and the language of grafting, transplanting, arranging, and weeding to engage central social issues of the century: imperialism, slavery, women's rights, and the democratic use of space. Chapter One explores how the idea of plant geography and transplantation fostered a nationalist discourse about plant origins. Focusing on writings across Lydia Maria Child's career, I argue for the central role plants play in her sentimental conception and eventual critique of American nationalism. Chapter Two shows how Hawthorne's understanding of botanical mobility [...] seedlings and soil whose circulation flouts national and legal boundaries [...] leads him to dismiss the idea of a civic identity grounded in personal property. Chapter Three demonstrates how Stowe comes to believe that biological diversity is necessary to America's democratic project. In attending to the ways that botanical science at mid-century celebrate ecological diversity, Stowe's second abolitionist novel, Dred, imagines a more racially diverse society than that envisioned in Uncle Tom's Cabin. In Chapter Four, Dickinson turns to theories of plant vitality and migration to critique a scientific method that set plants apart from humans, posing instead the possibility of a radical environmental ethic that accounts for plant rights. 2019 - 06 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
