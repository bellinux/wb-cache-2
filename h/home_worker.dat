The annual UV occupational exposures of <b>home</b> <b>workers</b> for each of the six scenarios above in the location of Toowoomba (27. 5 ° S, 151. 9 ° E, elv 693 m) were estimated using a numerical model which incorporates measurements of the ambient UV exposure, and the fraction of time spent outdoors. The <b>home</b> <b>workers</b> within this study, regardless of time of year, exceeded the occupational exposure for UV during a normal working day.

40|$|The {{practice}} of {{working from home}} has become widespread in developed countries, and the numbers of regular <b>home</b> <b>workers</b> are steadily increasing. There are potentially positive implications for energy consumption associated with home working, but these depend on myriad variables. This qualitative study, {{based on interviews with}} regular <b>home</b> <b>workers,</b> provides a more in-depth perspective on how and why energy is used compared with quantitative models of household consumption. Ethnographic research data is analysed using insights from practice theory. Placing the practice at the heart of analysis, it explores meanings, materials and competences involved in home working, and attends to the affective experiences of practitioners. Considering working from home as an integrative practice, it explores how dispersed practices are incorporated into individual performances, bringing about affective satisfaction. Findings show that the {{practice of}} working from home is characterised by themes of comfort, control and flexibility, with implications for energy demand. It is argued that the synthesis of practice theory and affect can provide valuable insights for energy research. The paper discusses the implications for demand reduction, demand shifting and ‘smart’ controls, with reference to the role of employers, researchers, policy makers and <b>home</b> <b>workers</b> themselves...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the process}} of informalization and feminization the number of female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> is growing and relegated {{to the bottom of}} global value chains.

It is found that the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> in this study are part of a captive value chain, in which the buyers hold the power and control and in which the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> are highly vulnerable and powerless, as they are women with little marketing skills and knowledge, and highly dependent on the work. It is argued that organization not only helps the female <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> directly through access to savings and credit, awareness trainings, and the development of friendships, but also to increase their competence in the value chain through skill improvement, market knowledge, and collective bargaining. It might even lead to a change in chain governance from a captive towards a relational one, in which there is more trust and mutual dependence between producer and buyer. Furthermore, it is argued that organization is essential for creating an enabling environment for the <b>home</b> based <b>workers</b> to live and work.

Mistakenly, Lim believes Phua Chu Kang is there to bid for a renovation job. Phua Chu Kang agrees to the job only after Ah Ma calls in his arch-nemesis, Frankie Foo, to bid for the job together with him, both in the hope of being awarded a lucrative job in the future. While Phua Chu Kang is busy with construction, he misses his anniversary dinner with Rosie Phua, who is wined and dined by Lim instead. At his luxurious home, Lim reveals that he has been siphoning the majority of funds from phone-in donations to the nursing home for his personal use. Shocked and guilty, Rosie Phua attempts to convince Phua Chu Kang to stop work to no avail. Meanwhile, Ah Ma reveals that the elderly man she has been looking after is Phua Chu Kang's grandfather, Ah Kong, who abandoned Phua Chu Kang in the belief that he would bring the family bad luck. Rosie Phua joins forces with Ah Kong and Frankie Foo, who has a crush on her, to find Lim's laptop in order to bring him to justice. The trio are caught in action by Lim and his thugs, who in turn are apprehended by the police that Phua Chu Kang, who pretended to continue to work for Lim, called in.

40|$|Excerpt] In 2002 only a {{small number}} of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> {{represented}} by 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East (UHE) were involved in their union. Language, unfamiliarity with unions in the United States, and, in some cases, undocumented immigration status inhibited participation in the life of the union by the growing number of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers.</b> Despite these obstacles in 2007 perhaps the most active segment of the 60, 000 <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> in 1199 SEIU now comes from the approximately 10, 000 Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers.</b> Today, Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> are consistently overrepresented at union (not just home care) rallies and demonstrations and have helped organize several home care agencies, bringing significant numbers of additional Chinese workers into the union. Currently the Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> are organizing retirees and expanding their involvement in the political life of their communities. Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> have extended their activism into political participation in their communities and in the union 2 ̆ 7 s political program. Eighty to ninety percent of Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers,</b> who earn between 7 and 10 per hour and who cannot count on regular work contribute between 5 and 10 per month on top of their union dues to the union 2 ̆ 7 s political action committee, maybe the highest percentage in the union. What makes this turnaround particularly significant is the role education and training played in the organizing. In 2003, 1199, assisted by Cornell University labor educators, launched a series of two-day training sessions for home care union activists facilitated in Cantonese and Mandarin. Chinese home care activists trained as facilitators by 1199 led the training. To date the two-day activist training has been given thirteen times for over 700 Chinese <b>home</b> care <b>workers</b> who give up precious days to complete the training. Each new training session is eagerly awaited, and each new class has a waiting list of participants ready before it starts. Of those who have completed the activist training over 100 have attended additional training to become union delegates (stewards). This article will describe how the Chinese Activist Training was conceived, designed and presented...|$|R
