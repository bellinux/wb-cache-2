50|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> is an {{important}} measured factor of grinding in the manufacturing process of engineered parts and tools. Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying {{the surface of a}} workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through conventional machining processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the rate of wear of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate wear rate allows for more consistent material size. Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel wear rate which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|In <b>{{grinding}},</b> the <b>wheel</b> {{follows a}} simple path. For example, in plunge grinding a shaft, the wheel moves in towards {{the axis of}} the part, grinds it, and then moves back out. Since each slice of the wheel repeatedly contacts the same slice of the workpiece, any inaccuracies in the geometric shape of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> will be transferred onto the part. Therefore, {{the accuracy of the}} finished workpiece geometry is limited to the accuracy of the truing dresser. The accuracy becomes even worse as the <b>grind</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wears,</b> so truing must occur periodically to reshape it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wears</b> rapidly during {{ultrasonic}} assisted {{surface generation}} {{of a large}} aperture aspherical RB-SiC mirror, which leads to an increase of grinding force and profile error. In this paper, different types of resinoid bonded diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> with a same grit size were dressed with high-pressure abrasive water jet. The dressing effects of abrasive water jet were assessed through comparing the 3 D roughness of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> topographies before and after dressing. The experimental results show that diamond grits of a <b>worn</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> are protruding from bond after dressing. The feed rate of nozzle and the bond materials have {{significant impact on the}} 3 D surface roughness of the wheel and dressing efficient. The softer binder and the decrease of the feed rates and lead to deeper grooves during dressing of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> However, too low feed rate will make a large number of abrasive particles drop from binder, which worsens the wheel topography.

40|$|Abstract. The {{localized}} wear on {{grinding wheel}} edges {{is a common}} phenomenon on profile grinding since the abrasive grains are less attached to the bond. The <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> depends heavily on the process parameters, workpiece and wheel composition, causing changes on the process and profile deviation behaviors. In order to cope with these uncertainties, many natural and synthetic materials {{have been used in}} different grinding processes. However, the influence of mixed compositions of different types of abrasive grains on external cylindrical grinding is not well known. In order to assess this relation, a methodology procedure was developed providing an overview of the cinematic edges behavior on a progressive wheel wear. The methodology procedure is based on the acoustic emission technology, using a transducer with a 50 µm radius diamond tip. The tip, when in contact with a rotating grinding wheel, enables the evaluation of the cinematic cutting edges. The abrasive grain density was evaluated for different grinding wheel compositions and specific wear removal values. Furthermore, these results were compared to the profile deviation observed on the same tool, allowing the assessment of the influence of different microcrystalline corundum grains on the overall <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> behavior...|$|E

The toughness and wear resistance properties that make ceramics desirable, also make fabrication of parts difficult. The objective of this CRADA was to increase the grinding efficiency on Ceradyne Incorporated silicon nitride.

40|$|The {{total removal}} of <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> {{material}} includes two main parts. The larger {{of the two}} {{is the result of}} dressing and truing operation and the other relatively small part is due to the <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> which takes place during the actual grinding process. The frequency of dressing and truing operations depends on the cutting conditions, wheel characteristic, etc. However in dry grinding as there is no cutting fluid to transfer the heat from the contact zone, the <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> during <b>grinding</b> and the frequency of dressing is much higher due to the higher grinding forces and temperatures. Vibration grinding reduces <b>wear</b> of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> during the process considerably and decreases the frequency of dressing operation significantly.

What significantly influences the roughness of the machined surfaces in traverse grinding is the dressing of the grinding wheel, grinding parameters, and {{the form of the}} <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> in this proc-ess. The occurrence of wear steps on the active grinding wheel surface (AGWS) causes that the set-up depth of cut is split into the wheel’s different steps, which in turn is a reason of a varying roughness shaped by those steps.

40|$|Abstract The coolant {{delivery}} technique {{known as}} Minimal Quantity Lubrication (MQL) has been employed in machining {{since the end}} of the 20 th Century and has gained considerable evidence in the last years as a viable alternative to the use of the conventional coolant technique (flood). Due to the low oil flow rate delivered by the MQL technique in grinding operations, that generally varies from 20 to 240 ml / h in relation to near 600, 000 ml / h flow rate of the conventional coolant technique, the MQL technique provides a reduced risk for human health and environmental damage associated with the use, maintenance and disposal of cutting fluids. In this context, this study was carried out to evaluate the application viability of the minimum quantity lubrication coolant technique under different flow rates in the plunge cylindrical grinding of ABNT 4340 steel with an aluminum oxide wheel. Three flow rates were tested: 30, 60 and 120 ml/h. Grinding trials with the conventional coolant delivery method were also tested for comparative purposes. The output variables used to assess the efficiency of the MQL technique in this work are: roughness, roundness and hardness of the workpiece. <b>Grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> and power consumption were also monitored. The results showed that, despite the higher values of roughness and roundness of the workpiece, as well as the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>wear,</b> the values of these same parameters obtained after machining with the MQL technique were close to those obtained after machining with the conventional technique. No thermal damages and cracks on the machined surface, or even below the machined surface, were observed after grinding ABNT 4340 steel irrespective of the coolant-lubrication condition investigated. The results showed that the MQL with 120 ml/h can be an alternative coolant technique due to cleaner environment and lower consumption of fluid in grinding under the conditions investigated in this work...|$|E

40|$|A {{necessary}} goal in {{the study}} of grinding advanced ceramic materials is to define grinding conditions that will machine ceramic components economically while maintaining dimensional accuracy and surface integrity of the resulting parts. In view of the high price of diamond wheels, which are the optimum choice for machining ceramics, it is important to investigate the process of diamond-wheel wear in grinding ceramic materials. Little information is currently available on the rates of diamond-wheel wear in grinding ceramic materials. This thesis processes a new method of measuring <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> using a duplication pattern of the <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel.</b> Plunge-grinding experiments on sintered silicon nitride (SSN) and sintered reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN) were conducted using a horizontal-spindle surface grinder with diamond-grit, resin-bond peripheral wheels.

Major contributions of this thesis research include development of a method for measuring <b>wear</b> of diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>wheels,</b> and identification of the interrelation between the rate of <b>wheel</b> <b>wear</b> and the two machining parameters (namely, downfeed and wheel speed used in the investigation) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is used in}} high {{precision}} grinding process, when work piece has a very high hardness. For a specific <b>grinding</b> interval, the <b>wheel</b> must be properly dressed, in order to remove swarf, sharpen the worn diamond grits, open up new diamond protrusions, and recondition the bond material. Dressing of diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>wheel</b> by alumina dressing tool has been simulated in a pin-on-disk machine in the research. Sharpening of the wheel is indicated by the increase of its roughness value, and surface microstructure with protruding sharp diamond grits. It was found that increasing of sliding distant from 100 to 500 m will increase the roughness of the wheel. The increase of contact load from 10 to 20 N will also increase roughness of the wheel, and the severity of <b>wheel</b> <b>wear,</b> indicated by high values of friction coefficient. A proper dressing of this nickel bonded SD 1200 diamond wheel is by sliding against alumina dressing tool for at least 300 m under 10 N load. Sliding velocity between 0. 1 to 0. 3 m/s has minimal effect to the results.
