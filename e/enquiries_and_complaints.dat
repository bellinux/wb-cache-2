Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC),Akurebusiness district is responsible for distribution of electricity for people of Akure in Ondo State, Nigeria. Face to face customer contact is time consuming,since the consumershave to be physically present for both parties to meet before solution can be proffered. Telephone communication with BEDC enables the customers to call and make enquiriesand receive responses about information or services required. Consumers need strong communication skills in telephone communication which may be lacking in some cases; customers may need to go through several people before the ideal person who can help him is eventually reached. The BEDC existing {{customer service}} system is saddled with limitations such as poor customer services and relations, high response time. The need to improve on the weakness of the traditional customer services system {{led to the development of}} this e-customer service system. This paper aims to eliminate these weaknesses by automating the process through an e-Customer Care Service System by which customer makes an <b>enquiries</b> <b>and</b> <b>complaints</b> on the services delivered by the company...|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} With often florid allegations about health problems arising from wind turbine exposure now widespread {{in parts of}} rural Australia and on the internet, nocebo effects potentially confound any future investigation of turbine health impact. Historical audits of health complaints across periods when such claims were rare are therefore important. We test 4 hypotheses relevant to psychogenic explanations of the variable timing and distribution of health <b>and</b> noise <b>complaints</b> about wind farms in Australia. Setting All (n= 51) Australian wind farms (with 1634 turbines) operating from 1993 – 2012.

Results There are large spatio-temporal variations in wind farm noise <b>and</b> health <b>complaints.</b> 33 / 51 (64. 7...|$|R
