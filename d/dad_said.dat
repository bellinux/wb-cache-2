500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich {{asked if she could}} sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My <b>dad</b> <b>said</b> that people would never pay that much for a bottle of beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E
500|$|As {{the show}} {{is based on the}} uncensored novel {{released}} in 2011, rather than the 1953 film adaptation, it contains references to prostitution and gay sex, as well as the Army's investigation into them, that the film did not feature. The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition {{that it had to be}} based on the original book. James Jones's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show's opening night in London. During its preview period some people walked out of the performance, having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production. Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden, said that the [...] "James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." [...] Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up, but added that [...] "I'm thrilled—it's so sophisticated and moving." [...] She also noted that she [...] "was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes, because my <b>dad</b> <b>said</b> this is just the way it was back then" [...] and that [...] "my father would have been amazed".|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And <b>Dad</b> <b>said,</b> 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} {{is based on}} the show's creator Josh Schwartz who told: [...] "The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my <b>dad.</b> He <b>said</b> about Sandy: [...] "He is never a man who can refuse to help someone." ...|$|R

50|$|This slow to mid-tempo song {{takes a look}} at the {{relationship}} between a father and a son. The narrator actually plays the part of the son begging his mom for assistance. He wants to know what his <b>dad</b> always <b>said</b> to make his mom stay because his lover is going to leave him.|$|R
5000|$|Crow {{states the}} {{inspiration}} for the song came from one of her father's sayings: [...] "My <b>dad</b> always <b>said,</b> ‘Drive it like it’s stolen, and park it like it’s rented.’ And I thought, that’s how you have to live life. So I’ve always wanted to write a song with that idea in it".|$|R

However, {{when he arrived}} in Cahokia, Illinois things didn't work out so well, so he called his <b>dad</b> who <b>said</b> he could stay wherever he wanted. He crossed the Mississippi River and stayed at Adam's Mark hotel in St. Louis MO over a rainy 4 July weekend.|$|R
50|$|She {{continued}} to play StarCraft and {{was fascinated by the}} professional tournaments on T.V. At 16, after seeing BoxeR play on TV, she decided that she wanted to become a professional gamer. When she told her <b>dad,</b> he <b>said</b> he wished he had never introduced her to StarCraft.

6000|$|Ah, it's a great responsibility, you'll find, {{when you}} come to my age. Last year <b>Dad</b> <b>said</b> I was {{fatiguing}} myself with my duties, and he actually wanted me to give up the keys to old Amoore, our housekeeper. I wouldn't. I hate her. I said, [...] "No, sir. I am Mistress of Marklake Hall just as long as I live, because I'm never going to be married, and I shall give out stores and linen till I die!" ...|$|E

Your dad was aboot to draw. But Jorth made no sign to throw a gun." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{was rude}} to Rene, I'm afraid; but I was {{properly}} served out for it. One always is. You see, Dad {{went down to}} Hastings to pay his respects to the General who commanded the brigade there, and {{to bring him to}} the Hall afterwards. Dad told me he was a very brave soldier from India--he was Colonel of Dad's Regiment, the Thirty-third Foot, after Dad left the Army, and then he changed his name from Wesley to Wellesley, or else the other way about; and <b>Dad</b> <b>said</b> I was to get out all the silver for him, and I knew that meant a big dinner. So I sent down to the sea for early mackerel, and had such a morning in the kitchen and the store-rooms. Old Amoore nearly cried.|$|E
5000|$|In particular, Barker has {{credited}} {{music from}} Wax Fang for his inspiration in writing certain American <b>Dad!</b> plots. <b>Said</b> Barker, [...] "There's just something so inherently cinematic about Wax Fang's music. Scott Carney's voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different interpretations." [...] Barker added that through {{listening to the}} Wax Fang track Majestic, {{he was able to}} come up with major plot elements for the episode [...] "Lost in Space" [...] (this episode features the Wax Fang songs Majestic and At Sea).|$|R

500|$|Ruby Messer Barber {{had this}} to say about joining the WAVES, [...] "It was a choice of adventure.

There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence.

6000|$|The Mohurrum, {{the great}} mourning-festival of the Muhammadans, was close at hand, {{and the things}} that Wali <b>Dad</b> <b>said</b> about {{religious}} fanaticism would have secured his expulsion from the loosest-thinking Muslim sect. There were the rose-bushes round us, the stars above us, and from every quarter of the City came the boom of the big Mohurrum drums, You must know that the City is divided in fairly equal proportions between the Hindus and the Musalmans, and where both creeds belong to the fighting races, a big religious festival gives ample chance for trouble. When they can--that is to say when the authorities are weak enough to allow it--the Hindus do their best to arrange some minor feast-day of their own in time to clash with the period of general mourning for the martyrs Hasan and Hussain, the heroes of the Mohurrum. Gilt and painted paper presentations of their tombs are borne with shouting and wailing, music, torches, and yells, through the principal thoroughfares of the City, which fakements are called tazias. Their passage is rigorously laid down beforehand by the Police, and detachments of Police accompany each tazias, lest the Hindus should throw bricks at it and the peace of the Queen and the heads of Her loyal subjects should thereby be broken. Mohurrum time in a [...] "fighting" [...] town means anxiety to all the officials, because, if a riot breaks out, the officials and not the rioters are held responsible. The former must foresee everything, and while not making their precautions ridiculously elaborate, must see that they are at least adequate.|$|E
