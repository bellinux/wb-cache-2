40|$|We {{evaluate}} the economic feasibility of a fast pyrolysis facility producing biobased commodity chemicals based on various manifestations of Integrated Catalytic Processing (ICP). Five scenarios are analyzed: {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) of whole pyrolysis oil (WPO); one-stage <b>hydrotreating</b> and FCC of WPO; FCC of the aqueous phase of pyrolysis oil (APPO); one-stage <b>hydrotreating</b> and FCC of the APPO; and two-stage <b>hydrotreating</b> followed by FCC of the APPO. We calculate the {{internal rate of return}} (IRR) for each scenario as functions of the costs of feedstock, hydrogen, and catalyst, and projected revenues for the facility. The assumed feedstock cost is $ 83 /MT for mixed wood. The assumed hydrogen cost is $ 3 /kg. Catalyst costs are based on December 2010 prices and projected revenues are based on August 2010 petrochemical prices. The analysis indicates that a facility employing FCC of WPO or APPO without <b>hydrotreating</b> is unable to generate a positive IRR.

It has yet to be produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. While <b>hydrotreating</b> is currently the most common pathway to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarboxylation/decarbonylation, there is an alternative process offering a number of important advantages over <b>hydrotreating.</b> In this regard, the work of Crocker et al. and Lercher et al. is particularly noteworthy. For oil refining, research is underway for catalytic conversion of renewable fuels by decarboxylation. As the oxygen is present in crude oil at rather low levels, of the order of 0.5%, deoxygenation in petroleum refining is not of much concern, and no catalysts are specifically formulated for oxygenates <b>hydrotreating.</b> Hence, one of the critical technical challenges to make the hydrodeoxygenation of algae oil process economically feasible is related to the research and development of effective catalysts.|$|R

40|$|Several {{atmospheric}} residues (AR) of Kuwaiti crude, in the absence, {{or in the}} presence, {{of light}} cycle oil (LCO) as an aromatic additive, were <b>hydrotreated</b> in an experimental plant. Asphaltenes (precipitated from Kuwaiti AR, a <b>hydrotreated</b> AR, and a <b>hydrotreated</b> blend of AR and LCO) were characterised by chemical structure and changes during residue hydrotreatment. The average structural parameters of these asphaltenes, obtained from a combined method of element analysis, average molecular weight, X-ray diffraction, and NMR, demonstrate that, after hydrotreatment, the aromatic cores of the asphaltenes become more compact and smaller whereas the peripheral alkyl branches are decreased in number and shortened. The influence of LCO on residue <b>hydrotreating</b> is also studied in terms of structural changes in the asphaltenes. The findings imply that LCO added to AR during <b>hydrotreating</b> improves the degree of aromatic substitution, the total hydrogen/carbon atomic ratio per average molecule, the distance between aromatic sheets and aliphatic chains, and so forth, by modifying the colloidal nature and microstructure of asphaltene: this is beneficial for the further hydroprocessing of AR.

40|$|In this Quarter, the {{research}} was focused continually on the two general tasks: Task 1, molecular organometallic catalysts for hydrogenation and Task 2, organic base catalysts for arene hydrogenation and the <b>hydrotreating</b> of the coal liquids.

40|$|The global {{petroleum}} {{demand is}} projected to increase in the next decennia as oil is expected to remain {{the primary source of}} energy around the globe contributing to approximately 40 % of the total consumption. The production of high-quality fuels from crude oil involves physical separation steps but also catalytic processes to remove contaminants (<b>hydrotreating),</b> shift the boiling point (alkylation and hydrocracking) and increase fuel quality (isomerisation). In <b>hydrotreating</b> sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and metal atoms are removed from the different petroleum streams and unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrogenated. The main reasons for refineries to perform <b>hydrotreating</b> are of environmental and economic nature. Besides protection of downstream catalysts from poisoning by sulfur, stringent environmental legislation has been aimed at the reduction of sulfur oxide emissions from fuel combustion. The environmental regulations on transportation fuel quality and the diminishing supplies of lighter types of crude oil necessitate further improvement of <b>hydrotreating</b> processes. An important approach is then to further optimize the catalytic activity of <b>hydrotreating</b> catalysts. In spite of the substantial progress made in the fundamental understanding of the active phase morphology, the metal-support interaction and reaction mechanisms, many details about the nature and stability of the active sites have not yet been elucidated.
