The film features the debut of Marie Eline in the main role as Edna Robinson, a young girl who foils an attempt by a robbery to loot her family's home. All the thief manages to take is her toy bank, containing 29 cents. Edna ends up taking it upon herself to catch the thief after the police fail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> It was reviewed positively by critics and was viewed across the United States. The film was the first split-reel by Thanhouser, containing this short and The Old Shoe Came Back on a single reel.|$|E

5|$|Following the June 25, 1950, {{outbreak}} of the Korean War after {{the invasion of the}} Republic of Korea (South Korea) by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), the United Nations voted to commit troops to the conflict in support of South Korea. The United States, {{as a member of the}} UN, committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goals of repelling the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. By 1950, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the US 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea. However, it faced numerous disadvantages. The forces were poorly equipped; many battalions had only two companies of infantry, as opposed to the regulation three. Headquarters Company, and supporting platoon elements were much smaller than regulation stated, making them substantially less effective. Most of the soldiers of the division had no combat experience and used to the luxuries of life in occupied Japan. Only one third of the officers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Task</b> Force had combat experience from World War II, and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) on the latency of {{two different types of}} visually-guided vertical saccades: reflexive saccades triggered by the sudden onset of a target, and saccades towards target locations known in advance. For this reason, we used two oculomotor tasks: a gap and a delay task, respectively. Nine normal subjects performed vertical saccades at ± 7. 5 and ± 15 °. TMS was applied at 80 and 100 ms after target onset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap <b>task,</b> and after fixation offset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delay <b>task.</b> Without TMS, we confirmed a latency asymmetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap <b>task</b> favouring upward saccades at the lower eccentricity (7. 5 °), and a latency symmetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delay <b>task.</b> TMS increased <b>the</b> latencies of all saccades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delay <b>task,</b> when delivered at 100 ms. This effect was mostly pronounced for downward saccades at 7. 5 °. As a result, saccade latencies showed an asymmetry in this condition, similar to <b>the</b> one observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap <b>task</b> without TMS. <b>The</b> gap <b>task</b> with TMS resulted in a variable latency distribution and no significant overall effect on saccade latency. Our results indicate that the right PPC is involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation of vertical saccades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delay <b>task,</b> and that this involvement appears to be enhanced for downward saccades. A conclusion for the involvement of this area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gap <b>task</b> could not be drawn from this study. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
