40|$|We {{report the}} use of nano-meter sized zeolite {{particles}} as a novel approach to follow the endosomal acidification and proteolysis inside a viable cell. The method was verified by using human peripheral monocytes, a well known <b>endocytosing</b> cell population. Zeolite particles were subsequently used to investigate the <b>endocytosing</b> mechanisms of human peripheral dendritic cells (DCs). Probes detecting pH neutral and acidic endosomes were adsorbed to de-aluminated zeolite Y, and used to detect endocytosis in immature human peripheral blood DCs. Both the myeloid (mDCs) and the plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cell subsets had an <b>endocytosing</b> capacity comparable to peripheral blood monocytes. However, the majority of both subsets of DCs retained their endosomes at a neutral pH during the first hours after endocytosis and {{only a small number}} of the mDCs showed any formation of acidic endosomes. Proteolytic degradation of <b>endocytosed</b> proteins was detected using self-quenched DQ-ovalbumin adsorbed to zeolite particles. Interestingly, a clear difference in proteolytic degradation of <b>endocytosed</b> ovalbumin was observed between the two subsets of DCs. The mDC showed an efficient degradation of ovalbumin, while the pDC population displayed no or only minor proteolytic degradation. In conclusion, zeolite particles provide a useful tool to study the <b>endocytosing</b> mechanisms, and an efficient carrier of bio-molecules into the endosomal pathways of viable cells...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that intracellular hyaluronidase- 1 (Hyal- 1), considered as a lysosomal enzyme, originates from the endocytosis of the serum enzyme. To check this proposal we have investigated the uptake of recombinant human hyaluronidase- 1 (rhHyal- 1) by mouse liver and its intracellular distribution, making use of centrifugation methods. Experiments were performed on wild type mice injected with 125 I-rhHyal- 1 and on null mice (Hyal- 1 -/-) injected with the unlabelled enzyme. Mice were euthanized at increasing times after injection Activity of the unlabelled enzyme was determined by zymography. Intracellular distribution of the Hyal- 1 was investigated by differential and isopycnic centrifugation. Results indicated that rhHyal- 1 is <b>endocytosed</b> by the liver, mainly by sinusoidal cells and follows the intracellular pathway described for many <b>endocytosed</b> proteins that find themselves eventually in lysosomes. However, Hyal- 1 endocytosis has some particular features. <b>Endocytosed</b> rhHyal- 1 is quickly degraded. Its distribution after differential centrifugation differs from the distribution of β-galactosidase, taken as reference enzyme of lysosomes. After isopycnic centrifugation in a sucrose gradient, <b>endocytosed</b> rhHyal- 1 behaves like β-galactosidase soon after injection but Hyal- 1 distribution is markedly less affected than the distribution of β-galactosidase by a prior injection of Triton WR- 1339 to the mice. This agent is a specific density perturbant of lysosomes. Behaviour in centrifugation of endogenous liver Hyal- 1, identified by HA zymography exhibits some kinship with the behaviour of the <b>endocytosed</b> enzyme, suggesting that it could originate from an endocytosis of the serum enzyme. Overall, these results could be explained by supposing that active <b>endocytosed</b> Hyal- 1 is mainly present in early lysosomes. Although its degradation half-time is short, Hyal- 1 could exert its activity owing to a constant supply of active molecules from the blood...|$|R

In this way, the mannose receptor acts as a pattern recognition receptor.

50|$|TGF-β is {{secreted}} by many cell types, including macrophages, in {{a latent}} {{form in which}} it is complexed with two other polypeptides, latent TGF-beta binding protein (LTBP) and latency-associated peptide (LAP). Serum proteinases such as plasmin catalyze the release of active TGF-β from the complex.

Inflammatory stimuli that activate macrophages enhance the release of active TGF-β by promoting the activation of plasmin. Macrophages can also <b>endocytose</b> IgG-bound latent TGF-β complexes that are secreted by plasma cells and then release active TGF-β into the extracellular fluid.

5000|$|Porosomes are {{cup-shaped}} supramolecular {{structures in}} the cell membranes of eukaryotic cells where secretory vesicles transiently dock {{in the process of}} vesicle fusion and secretion. The transient fusion of secretory vesicle membrane at the porosome base via SNARE proteins, result in the formation of a fusion pore or continuity for the release of intravesicular contents from the cell. After secretion is complete, the fusion pore temporarily formed {{at the base of the}} porosome is sealed. The porosomes are few nanometers in size and contain many different types of protein, especially chloride and calcium channels, actin, and SNARE proteins that mediate the docking and fusion of the vesicles with the cell membrane. Once the vesicles have docked with the SNARE proteins, they swell, which increases their internal pressure. They then transiently fuse at the base of the porosome, and these pressurized contents are ejected from the cell. Examination of cells following secretion using electron microscopy, demonstrate increased presence of partially empty vesicles following secretion. This suggested that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular contents are able to exit the cell.

40|$|<b>Endocytosed</b> {{proteins}} are sorted {{in early}} endosomes to be recycled to the plasma membrane or transported {{further into the}} degradative pathway. We studied the role of endosomes acidification on the endocytic trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR) as a representative for the recycling pathway, the cation-dependent mannose 6 -phosphate receptor (MPR) as a prototype for transport to late endosomes, and fluid-phase <b>endocytosed</b> HRP as a marker for transport to lysosomes. Toward this purpose, bafilomycin A 1 (Baf), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump, was used to inhibit acidification of the vacuolar system. Microspectrofluorometric measurement of the pH of fluorescein-rhodamine-conjugated transferrin (Tf) -containing endocytic compartments in living cells revealed elevated endosomal pH values (pH > 7. 0) within 2 min after addition of Baf. Although recycling of <b>endocytosed</b> Tf to the plasma membrane continued {{in the presence of}} Baf, recycled Tf did not dissociate from its receptor, indicating failure of Fe 3 + release due to a neutral endosomal pH. In the presence of Baf, the rates of internalization and recycling of Tf were reduced by a factor of 1. 40 +/- 0. 08 and 1. 57 +/- 0. 25, respectively. Consequently, little if any in TfR expression at the cell surface was measured during Baf treatment. Sorting between <b>endocytosed</b> TfR and MPR was analyzed by the HRP-catalyzed 3, 3 '- diaminobenzidine cross-linking technique, using transferrin conjugated to HRP to label the endocytic pathway of the TfR. In the absence of Baf, <b>endocytosed</b> surface 125 I-labeled MPR was sorted from the TfR pathway starting at 10 min after uptake, reaching a plateau of 40 % after 45 min. In the presence of Baf, sorting was initiated after 20 min of uptake, reaching approximately 40 % after 60 min. Transport of fluid-phase <b>endocytosed</b> HRP to late endosomes and lysosomes was measured using cell fractionation and immunogold electron microscopy. Baf did not interfere with transport of HRP to MPR-labeled late endosomes, but nearly completely abrogated transport to cathepsin D- labeled lysosomes. From these results, we conclude that trafficking through early and late endosomes, but not to lysosomes, continued upon inactivation of the vacuolar proton pump...|$|R
40|$|Claudins (Cldns) are transmembranous tight {{junction}} (TJ) proteins that seal the paracellular cleft in epithelia and endothelia. They regulate the paracellular solute exchange through Cldn-Cldn interactions {{along the same}} membrane (cis) and with Cldns in neighboring cells (trans). TJ-remodeling via endocytosis and incorporation of different Cldns is an essential regulator of TJ-composition which determines the barrier properties of a cell layer. In this study, cross-over endocytosis was characterized, a mechanism during which Cldns are <b>endocytosed</b> into the neighboring cell together with the cell’s own Cldns. Amino acid substitutions in the second extracellular loop of Cldn 5 (Cldn 5 F 147 A, Cldn 5 Q 156 E) led to reduced cis- and trans-interactions, and to impaired barrier function in MDCK-II cells which was accompanied by reduced TJ-strand formation. Cross-over endocytosis was shown to depend on Cldn-Cldn interactions, as Cldn 5 F 147 A und Cldn 5 Q 156 E were less frequently cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> than wildtype Cldn 5. Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) -microscopy the existence of Cldn 5 -containing, double membrane vesicles was demonstrated. The outer membrane of this vesicle was oriented towards the cytosol, which was confirmed by selective proteolysis of cytoplasmic material. Cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> Cldn 5 located towards the lumen of the vesicle. Different Cldn-subtypes as well as occludin were found to colocalize with these vesicles. Therefore cross-over endocytosis {{is a process that}} internalizes coherent membrane sections, but not individual Cldn molecules. Cross-over endocytosis depended on clathrin/adapter protein  2 and caveolin/cholesterol but was independent of dynamin. Moreover, degradation of cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> vesicles via the autophagy/lysosomal pathway was demonstrated. Cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> Cldn 5 was shown to colocalize with the lysosome, as well as with autophagy markers (LC 3, ATG 16 L). Inhibition of lysosomal degradation led to an accumulation of cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> Cldn 5. ATG 16 L is known to be involved in autophagosome biogenesis and is typically found in early stages of autophagosome formation. The presence of ATG 16 L and GFP-LC 3 in cross-over <b>endocytosed</b> vesicles suggests a direct role for the autophagosomal machinery in the endocytosis of Cldns integrated in the TJs. Internalization of Cldn-derived peptides occurred via binding of the peptides to Cldns inside the TJs and to free Cldns outside the TJs. In conclusion this study characterized a mechanism that, in the context of existing knowledge, has relevance for the remodeling of cell contacts and for the endocytosis of transmembrane proteins with strong associations with the opposing membrane. As a means for the regulation of the permeability of cell barriers cross-over endocytosis plays an important role for physiologic and pathologic conditions...|$|R
