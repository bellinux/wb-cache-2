This paper will discuss the maneuver controls for a system of multiple space-based telescopes to secure optimal image quality. Such distributed aperture systems eff ectively measure the Fourier Transform of the collected light so that the observed wave pattern {{is seen in the}} <b>frequency</b> <b>plane.</b> This Fourier Transform representation of physical spacecraft maneuvers may be interpreted as coverage regions (discs) in the <b>frequency</b> <b>plane.</b> Superior coverage of the <b>frequency</b> <b>plane,</b> which is directly related to image quality, is investigated for imaging distant objects using interferometric techniques where apertures are distributed on multiple space-based telescopes. The corresponding cost function is based on the optimality of the spacecraft maneuvers, which in turn is based on achieving a high image quality. This study builds on previous research wherein the first-order necessary conditions (FONC) were derived. The FONC are derived for specialized rectilinear motion and expanded to incorporate varying coverage disc velocities. These linearized equations are verifi ed to be consistent with those for the constant velocity case. Next, linearized first-order necessary conditions are shown to correspond closely with the fully nonlinear case. After that, the conditions for optimal overlap of the coverage paths will be given; these conditions lead to the optimal cost based on <b>frequency</b> <b>plane</b> parameters.

40|$|Electroencephalogram (EEG) {{measures}} {{brain function}} {{by analyzing the}} scalp electrical activity generated by brain structures. Local current flows are produced when brain cells (neurons) are activated. However, only electrical activity generated by large populations of neurons concurrently active can be recorded on the head surface. The small electrical signals detected by the scalp electrodes are amplified thousands of times, then displayed on paper or stored to computer memory. EEG like all biomedical signals is very susceptible {{to a variety of}} large signal contamination which reduces its clinical usefulness. Many researches had discovered that EEG signals are noisy and non-stationary. These EEG signals are contaminated by artifacts due to blinking, eyeball movements and muscle movements. However the main contamination is due to ocular artifacts elicited by blinking and eyeball movements. This research proposed a novel approach of adopting lifting wavelet transform (LWT) to eliminate ocular artifacts. Three basic steps involved were to transform the EEG, hard thresholding the wavelet coefficients and the corrected EEG was obtained by inverse transform these threshold coefficients. It is of paramount important to select a suitable wavelet and threshold value to accomplish this task. Thus, to select a wavelet for artifact removal in electroencephalogram using this method, relative wavelet energies were determined before and after thresholding. Relative wavelet energy (RWE) gives information about the relative energy associated with different frequency bands and can be considered as a time-scale density.

By comparing them with the ones recorded in other volcanic areas and described in literature (Wassermann, 2002; McNutt, 2002; Díaz et al., 2007), we grouped these events in three categories: 817 VTB (Volcanic-Tectonic type B) events, 159 HF (High Frequency) events and 53 SDE’s (Short Duration Event). Small-magnitude VTB swarms, with frequency band between 2 and 6 Hz and mean time length of about 30 seconds, were almost all recorded in the first 7 days, while in the last 2 days, OBS recorded HF events with frequency band over 40 Hz and few minutes of length. Signals with similar frequency and time domain features are associated, to hydrothermal activity (Ohminato, 2006). The SDE waveform, characterized by a monochromatic signal with a slowly decaying envelope, is generated by oscillations of a resonant body excited by magmatic or hydrothermal activity (Chouet, 1996). We applied, to all the signals dataset, polarization and high resolution parametric spectral analysis. This kind of study allowed to mark the VTB events as multi P-phase events with shallow sources placed in a narrow azimuthal window as regards the OBS/H position.
