5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging <b>in</b> <b>Internet</b> fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

40|$|Using the Internet for {{educational}} purposes {{is crucial for}} learning, research, communication and information sharing. However, rural and urban students do not have equal access to the <b>Internet.</b> Conducted <b>in</b> Turkey in the 2010 - 2011 school year, this study aimed to investigate the attitudes of rural and urban secondary school students towards {{the use of the}} Internet. The participants were 225 students, 115 from urban and 110 from rural areas. In this study the causal-comparative research design was used and data were collected using the Scale for Internet Use Attitudes (SIUA) with a five-point Likert-type scale. The SIUA has six subdimensions: “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> education”, “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> research”, “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> social interactions”, “liking the use of the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> education”, “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> communication”, and “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> information sharing”. The data were analyzed using independent samples t-test in the SPSS software package. The results revealed a significant difference in favor of urban students in the overall scores as well as the scores in the following subscale scores: “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> social interactions”, “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> communication”, “using the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> information sharing”, and “liking the use of the <b>Internet</b> <b>in</b> education”.
