However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a major role in Chilean society. Between 1851 and 1924 Chile only received the 0.5% of the European <b>immigration</b> <b>flow</b> to Latin America, compared to the 46% received by Argentina, 33% by Brazil, 14% by Cuba, and 4% by Uruguay. This was because most of the migration occurred across the Atlantic before the construction of the Panama Canal. Europeans preferred to stay in countries closer to their homelands instead of taking the long trip through the Straits of Magellan or across the Andes. In 1907, European-born immigrants composed 2.4% of the Chilean population, which fell to 1.8% in 1920, and 1.5% in 1930.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{ascertain}} the nature and determinants of changes of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> to Canada {{during the past two}} decades. It tries to determine the volume, source, and classes of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> as well as the factors that have influenced changes in these flows. In examining the factors that have influenced the <b>immigration</b> <b>flows,</b> the principal focus is on how they have been influenced by the roles and the interests of the Canadian federal and provincial governments, and to some extent also by some factors within the international political and economic systems. The analysis of domestic determinants of the flows is approached primarily from the state-centric perspective, which postulates that one of the major determinants of the nature and causes of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> to Canada are the interests, imperatives and preferences of the federal and provincial governments. The major findings of the thesis are that although the federal government performs a key role in determining annual <b>immigration</b> <b>flows,</b> over time the provinces have also been performing an increasingly significant role largely through their respective immigration programs. The most influential province has been Québec. Other provinces have followed Québec’s lead, albeit to a less significant extent. The thesis further reveals that the sizes of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> have been growing significantly during the past few decades. The source countries of immigrants and the number of immigrants arriving through the economic class, rather than the family and refugee classes, have changed substantially. These changes are the result of the political and economic trends that have affected the “push” and “pull” dynamics of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows,</b> and the policy preferences of the federal and provincial governments...|$|R

30|$|As {{with some}} other work {{studying}} immigration impacts, {{we need to take}} care to identify a causal impact of immigration. To do so we adopt and further develop the enclave approach to immigrant settlement pioneered by Card (2001) where actual <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> are instrumented by a predicted settlement variable generated from overall <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> on the assumption that new migrants go to live in locations where earlier migrants from their origin country also settled. As already noted, because we are focussing on the 2000 s in England and Wales, the significant compositional change of the structure of <b>immigration</b> <b>flows</b> has important implications for ensuring a causal impact of immigration can be identified. Our empirical analysis takes care to ensure we are able to implement this approach in a coherent manner for the setting we study.|$|R

50|$|In the 20th century, a large <b>immigration</b> <b>flow</b> {{from the}} Italian {{peninsula}} during the Fascist period occurred, {{as a result}} of a government policy: a number of people hailing from Veneto but also from Marche, Abruzzo and Sicily came to Sardinia to populate the island, especially the new mining town of Carbonia and the villages of Mussolinia di Sardegna (now Arborea) and Fertilia; besides, after World War II, Istrian Italian refugees were relocated in the Nurra region, along the north-west coastline.
