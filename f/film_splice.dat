In December 2010, she released a new photo collection book, [...] "Angel's Stars" [...] (天使的星星). However, {{at the press conference}} announcing its release, she was careful to emphasise that the book contained no nudity.|$|E
50|$|Dark Castle Entertainment's name pays {{homage to}} William Castle, a horror filmmaker from the 1950s and 1960s. When first formed, {{the goal was to}} remake Castle's horror films (very similar to another {{production}} company Platinum Dunes). After two remakes, it moved on to producing original material, along with remakes of non-Castle films. Starting with RocknRolla, the company began producing films in genres other than horror. Initially, most of the company's films were mostly critically panned, however recently their <b>film</b> <b>Splice</b> has received better reviews by critics.|$|E

50|$|On January 5, 2006, Brody {{confirmed}} {{speculation that}} {{he was interested in}} playing the role of The Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight. However, Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. decided instead to cast Heath Ledger in the role. He was also in talks with Paramount to play Spock in J. J. Abrams Star Trek XI, but it ultimately went to Zachary Quinto. In 2009, he starred in Splice, a science fiction film written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Originally a Sundance <b>film,</b> <b>Splice</b> was adopted by Dark Castle Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. Most recently, he played the star role of Royce in Predators (a sequel to the original Predator), directed by Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez.|$|E
5000|$|The {{science fiction}} <b>film</b> <b>Splice,</b> {{released}} 2009, shows scientists mixing together {{human and animal}} DNA {{in the hopes of}} advancing medical research. Calamitous results occur. The 1986 horror film The Fly features a deformed and monstrous human-animal hybrid, played by actor Jeff Goldblum. His character, scientist Seth Brundle, undergoes a teleportation experiment that goes awry and fuses him at a fundamental genetic level with a common fly caught besides him. Brundle experiences drastic mutations as a result that horrify him. Movie critic Gerardo Valero has written that the famous horror work, [...] "released {{at the dawn of the}} AIDS epidemic", [...] "was seen by many as a metaphor for the disease" [...] while also playing on bodily fears about dismemberment and coming apart that human beings inherently share.|$|E
5000|$|Lombardo became {{acquainted with}} Peckinpah when he moonlighted as a {{cameraman}} when Peckinpah was directing the television movie Noon Wine (1966). Ultimately this connection led to Lombardo's joining Peckinpah to make The Wild Bunch; Peckinpah was {{particularly interested in}} the editing techniques that Lombardo had devised while editing Felony Squad. Lombardo described the crucial scene from the television show in a later interview with Vincent LoBrutto, [...] "Joe Don Baker came out and was being shot by all these police. I printed every frame three times and created slow motion. I intercut him being shot, falling, this guy shooting, that guy running, Baker falling. Sam and Phil Feldman, the producer, saw it and said, 'You've got the job - and, as a matter of fact, we'll use that kind of thing.'" [...] The episode of Felony Squad was [...] "My Mommy Got Lost." [...] At that time, slow motion cameras were not commonly used for television work. Lombardo used the laborious trick of stretching time by repeating the individual frames of film two or three times, which required that there be a <b>film</b> <b>splice</b> at every frame. There are typically 24 frames of film exposed each second by standard motion picture cameras, so after tripling Lombardo had 72 frames per second. Intercutting involves the splicing of sections of film from different cameras, or from different [...] "takes" [...] of the same scene.|$|E

50|$|A <b>film</b> <b>splicer</b> (also {{called a}} film joiner, usually in Europe) is a device {{which can be}} used to {{physically}} join together lengths of photographic film. It is mostly used in film motion pictures. The units are made in various types depending on the usage: Single-8, Super 8 film, 16mm, 9,5 mm,35mm and 70mm. Used in film editing to make a cut (transition).|$|R

50|$|The Semetex {{prototype}} design {{actually had}} the eight channels of uncompressed data placed into three locations: data bordering {{both sides of}} the analog sound track and additional data tracks bordering the opposite edge of the picture frame. These locations were chosen to ensure the data were not placed into the sprocket perforation area of the film to prevent the known wear and degradation that occurs in the perforation area (due to the mechanical film sprockets) from degrading the data. Clocking and guide tracks were placed {{on each side of the}} film near the sprockets. The prototype sound camera imprinted the Digital audio and Analog audio 'at speed'. A companion digital reader was designed to form a complete system. After Sony received the prototype they enlarged the data bits from the original 8 micron (micrometer) size and moved the data locations; the eight digital audio channels are now recorded on (and recovered from) the edges of the film. As Sony engineers became more actively involved in the project, the design of the SDDS format evolved toward a more robust implementation, including the use of 5:1 ATRAC data compression, extensive error detection and correction, and most critically redundancy. The redundancy allows data to be recovered substantially intact even in the presence of a <b>film</b> <b>splice</b> (common for repairing damaged film). The data bit size on film was enlarged from 8 micron (micrometer) to 24 micrometers square, and Semetex's green laser system for the sound camera was replaced with simpler LED/fiber optic assemblies, which along with data compression, then allowed 24 micrometers square data.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{material}} feminist corpus, namely Stacy Alaimo’s concept of trans-corporeality, material flows and interconnectivity between humans and their environment insists that the human body has never been atomistic, but rather a porous figure that continually interacts/intra-acts with its environment. The recent biotechnological boom allowing {{for the production of}} human-animal hybrids (chimeras) provides the kind of visualization of these interconnectivities that can help instigate a reconception of the human—as not human at all, but rather posthuman. This study looks at the presence of these human-animal hybrids in popular art media, specifically: the horror <b>film,</b> <b>Splice</b> (Dir. Natali 2009); the YA novel, Inhuman (Falls 2013); and the comic, Sweet Tooth (Lemire 2009 - 2013). This thesis argues that the human-animal hybrid figure exhibits utopian horror, or the use of horror to produce new, better, ways of conceptualizing human-animal relationships, ones that acknowledge our already posthuman plurality of self...|$|E
40|$|The invented animal, a {{term used}} by Donna Haraway to {{describe}} the genetically engineered, patented animal, has its genesis in science fiction in Mary Shelley&# 039;s Frankenstein and H. G. Wells&# 039;s The Island of Doctor Moreau. In the twenty first century, this invented animal is, according to Haraway, a &# 039;genetically engineered being who haunts many places. &# 039; Both human and animal, this hybrid character-a true cyborg blurring the species boundary-also haunts contemporary science fiction. Vincenzo Natali&# 039;s 2009 transgenic science fiction horror <b>film</b> <b>Splice</b> joins Mikhail Bulgakov&# 039;s long-banned novel A Dog&# 039;s Heart, Maureen Duffy&# 039;s parable {{of the destruction of}} human individuality Gor Saga, and the postmodern Frankenstein that is Kirsten Bakis&# 039;s Lives of the Monster Dogs, in providing a voice to a protagonist who is a hybrid with the power of language. Jeremy Bentham&# 039;s famous response to Descartes, &# 039;the question with animals is not can they talk, or can they reason, but can they suffer,&# 039; is turned on its head in science fiction when the animal, merged by science with the human, can both reason and talk about its suffering. The hybrid creature represents cultural and social anxiety, challenging us to consider cyborg citizenship and rights in a posthuman reality. This paper investigates Splice, a science fiction narrative that raises the question of how we consider the status of the hybrid creature. With language a challenge to speciesism, we are forced to confront whether the hybrid&# 039;s animality or its humanness is to be privileged. By using Donna Haraway&# 039;s theories about the cyborg, this paper explores what is revealed when language, which has defined a key aspect of humanity, is now shared with the animal...|$|E
5000|$|Film cement is {{a special}} glue {{designed}} to join motion picture film. It is made of film base dissolved in a solvent.

5000|$|Born in Adria, Province of Rovigo, {{the son of}} the {{musician}} Nino, Catozzo graduated in law, then in cello at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice, and finally in set design and directing at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome. He entered the film industry in the early 1940s as a screenwriter and later assistant director for several Mario Mattoli's comedy films. He debuted as a film editor in 1951 for Mattoli's My Heart Sings, and later worked with Alberto Lattuada, Mario Soldati and especially Federico Fellini whose films he edited during the fifties and sixties, most notably La Dolce Vita and 8½. In 1956 Catozzo received the American Cinema Editors Award for King Vidor's War and Peace. Being allergic to acetone, Catozzo projected and developed an innovative <b>film</b> <b>splicer,</b> later known as [...] "CIR-Catozzo", [...] "Pressa Catozzo" [...] or just [...] "Catozzo", using {{it for the first time}} in Fellini's Nights of Cabiria. The insistent demands of his colleagues forced him first to fabricate a hundred copies and later, to patent the machine which launched, in the early sixties, the mass production of the <b>film</b> <b>splicer,</b> something that gradually drew him away from his activity as an editor. In 1989 he received the Academy Scientific and Technical Award for his creation.|$|R

50|$|Filmmaker Jonas Mekas gave Conrad {{rolls of}} film and helped obtain a Bolex camera to use. He shot the black frames by {{covering}} the camera lens. He first tried unsuccessfully to shoot the white frames by removing the lens but ultimately ended up shooting a sheet of white paper. Conrad shot the material {{over the course of}} a few days. He produced one 16 mm roll with 47 arrangements of black and white frames and made ten copies. He used an inexpensive 8 mm <b>film</b> <b>splicer</b> to reorder the frames such that each of the 47 arrangements was repeated ten times.|$|R

5|$|Beck has an irreverent {{style of}} sampling, often using such sources as obscure <b>films</b> to <b>splice</b> {{together}} cuts of people {{talking in the}} background of his music, or various other found sounds to create sound collages {{in the background of}} his music.|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} processing, {{the film}} is removed automatically or by an operator handling the film in a light proof bag from which it is fed into the processing machine. The processing machinery is generally run on a continuous basis with <b>films</b> <b>spliced</b> together in a continuous line. All the processing steps are carried out within a single processing machine with automatically controlled time, temperature and solution replenishment rate. The film or prints emerge washed and dry and ready to be cut by hand. Some modern machines also cut films and prints automatically, sometimes resulting in negatives cut across {{the middle of the}} frame where the space between frames is very thin or the frame edge is indistinct, as in an image taken in low light.|$|R
50|$|Negative cutting (also {{known as}} {{negative}} matching and negative conforming) {{is the process}} of cutting motion picture negative to match precisely the final edit as specified by the film editor. Original camera negative (OCN) is cut with scissors and joined using a <b>film</b> <b>splicer</b> and <b>film</b> cement. Negative cutting is part of the post-production process and occurs after editing and prior to striking internegatives and release prints. The process of negative cutting has changed little since the beginning of cinema in the early 20th century. In the early 1980s computer software was first used to aid the cutting process. Kodak introduced barcode on motion picture negative in the mid-1990s. This enabled negative cutters to more easily track shots and identify film sections based on keykode.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series was}} unusual {{in that it}} was shot on {{location}} around the world. Partly to offset the cost of this, the series was shot on 16mm film, rather than 35. The series was designed so that each pair of episodes could either be broadcast separately, or as a 2-hour film-length episode. Each episode cost about $1.5 million and the filming with Young Indy usually took around 3 weeks. The first production filming alternated between [...] "Sean" [...] and [...] "Corey" [...] episodes. The segments with old Indy were referred to as [...] "bookends." [...] Filming a pair of them typically took a day and most were shot at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina and on location in Wilmington. The show also featured footage from other <b>films</b> <b>spliced</b> into several episodes.|$|R
50|$|To make an {{international}} version, the studio would simply insert (on the soundtrack) music over any dialogue in the <b>film</b> and <b>splice</b> in intertitles (which {{would be replaced}} with the appropriate language of the country).

50|$|Kodascope {{is a name}} {{created by}} Eastman Kodak Company for the {{projector}} it placed {{on the market in}} 1923 as part of the first 16mm motion picture equipment. The original Kodascope was part of an outfit that included the Cine-Kodak camera, tripod, Kodascope projector, projection screen, and <b>film</b> <b>splicer,</b> all of which sold together for $335. By 1924, Victor Animatograph Corporation and Bell and Howell had placed 16mm projectors on the market, so Kodak eliminated the requirement to purchase the equipment as a complete outfit and sold the projector separately. Kodascope was retained as the primary marketing name for 16mm projectors throughout their production life at Kodak. It was also used to name Kodak's film rental library system. Kodascope Library, which operated from 1924 to 1939, and offered both educational and commercially released films on 16mm film and, from 1932, on 8mm film.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} English-Canadian cinema’s {{attempt to}} establish and maintain a popular cinema during {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century, specifically analyzing the relationship between Canadian genre filmmaking traditions and the complexities of attracting popular Canadian audiences to homegrown films. This extended study examines a variety of films and people in contemporary English-language Canadian cinema, from Anglophone Canadian star Paul Gross and his films Men with Brooms (2002) and Passchendaele, to horror <b>films</b> <b>Splice</b> (Vincenzo Natali 2010) and Pontypool (Bruce McDonald 2009), and finally the action-comedy Bon Cop, Bad Cop (Érik Canuel 2006). Discussing the respective political economies, marketing, critical receptions, and production histories of a diverse selection of contemporary English-language Canadian films in case-study format, this thesis finds that, while troubled, it is undoubtedly possible to create a popular contemporary English-language Canadian cinema that exists, at least geographically and politically, apart from the dominant Hollywood filmmaking...|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the 18-year-old {{photographer}} Martin Hanke {{founded the}} Hamaphot KG (limited partnership) in Dresden which specialized in photo accessories. When Dresden was bombarded in the Second World War, {{the company was}} destroyed. It was rebuilt in Monheim in 1945. In 1958, the first synchronized flash powder device was presented, in 1972 the world’s first automatic <b>film</b> <b>splicer.</b> Three years later, the “Hamafix” slide mounting system came onto the market. In 1990, Hama established their UK branch Hama PVAC Ltd. (Hama Photo, Video, Audio, Communications) and are UK distributor for Celestron, Tasco, Sandisk, Vivitar and Koss products. In 1991, Hama launched the “Videocut 200” which - according to company representatives - was the most frequently sold video editing device in Europe at that time. In 1993, the company name changed from Hamaphot to Hama. Two years later, the “MobileSafe” mobile phone holder {{was put on the}} market.

50|$|Perri {{worked for}} Scorsese again in 1980, {{designing}} a title sequence for Raging Bull. This featured a strong red logotype which emphasised the maniacal {{quality of the}} lead character, introducing a film that was shot in black and white.

5000|$|A {{movie with}} the same title (but an entirely {{different}} plot) was released in 1940, starring Errol Flynn. The studio used some key scenes from battles in the 1924 <b>film.</b> They <b>spliced</b> the scenes into the 1940 film, thinking {{they could not have}} been done better. [...] The life-sized replicas were considered so well recreated, that Warner Bros. repeatedly used them in later nautical films.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the short}} length of early <b>film</b> stock, <b>splicing</b> was {{necessary}} to join together segments into long-form. Actuality directors spliced together reels prior to shooting in order to record {{for longer periods of}} time. Narrative directors, on the other hand, preferred shooting for shorter lengths, editing together shot footage. In either case, film was cut (and subsequently joining the cut segments) in order to remove excess footage, focusing attention on significant elements.|$|R
