50|$|Iron {{represents}} {{perhaps the}} best-known example for allotropy in a metal. At atmospheric pressure, {{there are three}} allotropic forms of iron: alpha iron (α) also known as ferrite, gamma iron (γ) also known as austenite, and <b>delta</b> <b>iron</b> (δ). At very high pressure, a fourth form exists, called epsilon iron (ε) hexaferrum. Some controversial experimental evidence exists for another high-pressure form that is stable at very high pressures and temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{required to}} forge weld is typically 50 to 90 {{percent of the}} melting temperature. Iron can be welded when it surpasses the critical temperature (the A4 temperature) where its allotrope changes from gamma iron (face-centered cubic) to <b>delta</b> <b>iron</b> (body-centered cubic). Since the critical temperatures are affected by alloying agents like carbon, steel welds at a lower temperature-range than iron. As the carbon content in the steel increases, the welding temperature-range decreases in a linear fashion. Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can be welded to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can be welded when nearly white hot; between 2500 F and 2700 F. Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can be welded when orangish-yellow, between 1700 F and 2000 F. Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, is typically welded at a bright yellow heat.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{requirement}} for forge welding {{is that both}} weld surfaces need to be heated to the same temperature and welded before they cool too much. When steel reaches the proper temperature, it begins to weld very readily, so a thin rod or nail heated to the same temperature will tend to stick at first contact, requiring it to be bent or twisted loose. One of the simplest ways to tell if iron or steel is hot enough is to stick a magnet to it. When iron or steel cross the A2 critical temperature, it begins to change into the allotrope called gamma iron. When this happens, the steel or iron becomes non-magnetic. In steel, the carbon begins to mix with gamma iron at the A3 temperature, forming a solid solution called austenite. When it crosses the A4 critical temperature, it changes into <b>delta</b> <b>iron,</b> which is magnetic. Therefore, a blacksmith can tell when the welding temperature is reached by placing a magnet {{in contact with the}} metal. When red or orange-hot, a magnet will not stick to the metal, but when the welding temperature is crossed, the magnet will again stick to it. The steel may take on a glossy or wet appearance at the welding temperature. Care must be taken to avoid overheating the metal {{to the point that it}} gives off sparks from rapid oxidation (burning), or else the weld will be poor and brittle.|$|E
40|$|Background. Evidence of iron-mediated {{oxidative}} stress, neutrophil dysfunction {{and enhanced}} bacterial growth after intravenous (IV) iron {{administration has been}} ascribed to a labile or bioactive iron fraction present in all IV iron agents. Methods. To quantify and compare {{the size of the}} labile fraction in several classes of IV iron agents, we examined iron donation to transferrin (Tf) in vitro. We added dilutions of ferric gluconate, iron sucrose and each of two iron dextran preparations to serum in vitro, passed the resulting samples through alumina columns to remove iron agent and free organic iron, and measured Tf-bound iron in the resulting eluates. Comparing results to serum samples without added <b>iron,</b> we calculated <b>delta</b> Tf-bound <b>iron</b> for each agent at each concentration. Finally, we compared <b>delta</b> Tf-bound <b>iron</b> to the concentration of added agent and calculated the percent iron donation to Tf. Results. We found that Tf-bound iron increased with added iron concentration for each agent: <b>delta</b> Tf-bound <b>iron</b> was directly related to the concentration and type of iron agent (P< 0. 001). Mean percent iron donation to Tf ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 8 % with the following progression: iron dextran-Dexferrum< iron dextran-INFeD<iron sucrose<ferric gluconate. Pairwise differences between agents for percent iron donation were statistically significant (P< 0. 05) only between ferric gluconate and both iron dextran agents, and between iron sucrose and iron dextran-Dexferrum. Conclusions. Approximately 2 – 6 % of total iron in commonly used IV iron compounds is available for in vitro iron donation to Tf. This fraction may con-tribute to evidence of bioactive iron in patients after IV iron administration...|$|R

50|$|A year later, the 82nd {{went into}} action in Vietnam. During the Tet Offensive, which {{swept across the}} Vietnam in January 1968, the 3rd Brigade was en route to Chu Lai within 24 hours of {{receiving}} its orders. The 3rd Brigade performed combat duties in the Huế - Phu Bai area of the I Corps sector. Later the brigade moved south to Saigon, and fought in the Mekong <b>Delta,</b> the <b>Iron</b> Triangle and along the Cambodian border, serving nearly 22 months. While the 3rd Brigade was deployed, the division created a provisional 4th Brigade, consisting of 4th Battalion, 325th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 504th Infantry; and 3d Battalion, 505th Infantry. An additional unit, the 3d Battalion, 320th Artillery, was activated under Division Artillery to support the 4th Brigade.|$|R
40|$|Background. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is {{recognised}} as a {{major risk}} factor for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The association between H. pylori infection and iron deficiency anaemia has been established. Multiple mechanisms have been advocated to explain the relationship between H. pylori and iron status and their association might reduce iron deposit. Aim. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate whether H. pylori infection affects iron absorption. Methods. The study was designed on a prospective basis. Fifty-five subjects underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy to investigate the presence of H. pylori and, when this was positive, also search of serum anti-CagA was performed. Tests included an oral iron absorption test with the administration of 1 mg/kg of Fe 2 +. Iron levels were measured before and 2 h after iron administration (<b>delta</b> <b>iron).</b> H. pylori-positive subjects were administered antibiotic therapy for 1 week and, 2 months later, the oral iron absorption test was repeated and urea-breath test was first performed. Results. H. pylori-positive subjects had lower serum level of ferritin and lower <b>delta</b> <b>iron</b> compared to H. pylori-negative subjects. That difference is significant in anaemic women and is independent of the presence of serum anti-CagA antibodies. After H. pylori eradication iron absorption test was similar to those of non-infected subjects. Conclusion. H. pylori infection impairs iron uptake. That mechanism, together with others, may contribute to the depletion of iron in infected patients...|$|E
5|$|During February 1966, {{as part of}} an American road-building program {{designed}} to challenge the Viet Cong's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon, the US 1st Engineer Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent—had been engaged in constructing an all-weather road between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province, west of Ben Cat, on the northern apex of the Viet Cong base area known as the Iron Triangle. This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C, the Mekong <b>Delta,</b> the <b>Iron</b> Triangle and War Zone D, while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government.|$|R
