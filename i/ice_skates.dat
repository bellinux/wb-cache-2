5|$|After {{not being}} able to host the Games in 1944, Cortina d'Ampezzo was {{selected}} to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics. At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Guido Caroli, entered the Olympic Stadium on <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b> As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell, nearly extinguishing the flame. He was able to recover and light the cauldron. These were the first Winter Games to be televised, and the first Olympics ever broadcast to an international audience, though no television rights were sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The Cortina Games were used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events. The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact, winning more medals than any other nation. Chiharu Igaya won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia when he placed second in the slalom.|$|E
25|$|The sticks that Fitzstephen {{refers to}} {{were used for}} movement, as the {{primitive}} bone-made <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> did not have sharp gliding edges like modern <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b> Adding edges to <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> was invented by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. These <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. The construction of modern <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> has remained largely the same. The only other major change in ice skate design came soon after. Around {{the same time period}} as steel edges were added to <b>ice</b> <b>skates,</b> another Dutchman, a table maker’s apprentice, experimented with the height to width ratio of the metal blade of the <b>ice</b> <b>skates,</b> producing a design that remains almost unaltered to this day. The user of the skates no longer needed to use sticks for propulsion, and movement on skates was now freer and more stable.|$|E
25|$|The first {{depiction}} of ice skating {{in a work}} of art was made in the 15th century. The picture, of Saint Lidwina, patron saint of ice skaters, falling on the ice was the first work of art to feature ice skating as a main theme. Another important aspect of the painting is a man seen in the background, who is skating on one leg. This means that the <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> the man was wearing must have sharp edges similar to those found on modern <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b>|$|E

30|$|Our experience, both at {{different}} <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> locations {{and at the}} EDs, confirmed that in The Netherlands, no wrist protection is used when <b>ice</b> <b>skating.</b> Our findings suggest that, especially for a mature audience, protective wrist devices, as universally used in in-line skating, could {{reduce the incidence of}} wrist fractures during <b>ice</b> <b>skating,</b> assuming that the fall mechanism of in-line skating is similar to natural <b>ice</b> <b>skating.</b>|$|R

25|$|During wet or snowy weather, snow {{boots are}} worn {{to keep the}} foot warm and dry. They are {{typically}} made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. <b>Ice</b> <b>skates</b> are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{hockey is}} {{played on a}} hockey rink.

The first instructional book concerning <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> was published in London in 1772. The book, written by a British artillery lieutenant, Robert Jones, describes basic figure skating forms such as circles and figure eights. The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally <b>ice</b> <b>skate</b> in the late 18th century.

50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>skating</b> {{is popular}} {{in the north of}} India in places like Ladakh, Kashmir and Shimla where cold weather occurs and it is {{possible}} to skate outdoors. Much of India has a tropical climate, hence {{in the rest of the}} country, <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> is limited to the few artificial rinks available. Many skating lovers from India head to places like Shimla, Kashmir and Ladakh, and also many expatriates from countries where <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> is popular in order to experience <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> at some of the highest rinks in the world. An <b>ice</b> <b>skating</b> festival is organised in Shimla every year.|$|R
25|$|The game {{objective}} is to outscore the opposing team. The sport is played on an ice surface, primarily by women and girls, and {{requires the use of}} <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b> The sport uses a blue rubber pneumatic ring and all players, with the exception of goaltenders, use a straight stick. One of the sport's most recognizable and defining features {{is the fact that it}} does not involve the use of intentional body contact as a strategic component. Despite its primary popularity among female participants, the sport is officially mixed.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} figure skating {{stretches}} back to prehistoric times. Primitive <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> {{appear in the}} archaeological record from about 3000 BC. Edges were added by the Dutch in the 13th or 14th century. International figure skating competitions began appearing in the late 19th century—in 1891, the European Championships were inaugurated in Hamburg, Germany, and in 1896, the first World Championships were held in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire. At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England, figure skating became the first winter sport {{to be included in}} the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, figure skating was lent a more athletic character through the developments of Ulrich Salchow, a Swede. Salchow was considered the greatest figure skater of his day by far, winning the world championships ten times. The crowning achievement of his career, however, was his development of <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> with slightly serrated blades, giving enough traction on the ice to launch long jumps. The salchow jump, still used prominently in figure skating routines today, is named for him, and was considered Salchow's greatest contribution to figure skating.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no known}} fully {{accurate}} history of broomball. The {{consensus is that}} modern broomball originated in Canada. Some think it came about by trying to play ice hockey without <b>ice</b> <b>skates.</b> The first recorded broomball games in North America were in Perdue, Saskatchewan on March 5, 1909, although {{there is some evidence}} to suggest broomball was being played {{in a small town in}} Massey, Ontario. These games, however, were played on a football field as early as the 1890s. From Canada the game spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota, where by the 1960s a broomball community was thriving.|$|E
25|$|Many {{athletic}} shoes {{are designed with}} specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, <b>ice</b> <b>skates</b> have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been {{designed to provide a}} comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.|$|E
