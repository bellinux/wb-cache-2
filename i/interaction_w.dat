40|$|The {{solubility}} of satranidazole {{in several}} water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixtures was analysed {{in terms of}} solute-solvent interactions and data were treated {{on the basis of}} extended Hildebrand solubility approach. The solubility profile of satranidazole in water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixtures shows a curve with a solubility maxima well above the ideal solubility of drug. This is attributed to solvation of the drug with the water-N,N-dimethylformamide mixture, and indicates that the solute-solvent <b>interaction</b> energy (<b>W)</b> is larger than the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2) of regular solution theory. The new approach provides an accurate prediction of solubility once the <b>interaction</b> energy (<b>W)</b> is obtained. In this case, the energy term is regressed against a polynomial in δ 1 of the binary solvent mixture. A quartic expression of W in terms of solvent solubility parameter was found for predicting the mole fraction solubility of satranidazole in the studied mixtures.

40|$|To the Hubbard {{model on}} a square lattice we add an <b>interaction,</b> <b>W,</b> which {{depends upon the}} square of a near-neighbor hopping.

With a combination of finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations and the Maximum Entropy method, we study spin and charge degrees of freedom in the superconducting state. We give numerical evidence for the occurrence of a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to the d_x^ 2 -y^ 2 superconducting state.

The solubility of satranidazole in various propylene glycol-water mixtures was analyzed in terms of solute-solvent interactions using {{a modified version of}} Hildebrand-Scatchard treatment for regular solutions. The solubility equation employs term <b>interaction</b> energy (<b>W)</b> to replace the geometric mean (δ 1 δ 2), where δ 1 and δ 2 are the cohesive energy densities for the solvent and solute, respectively. The new equation provides an accurate prediction of solubility once the <b>interaction</b> energy, <b>W,</b> is obtained. In this case, the energy term is regressed against a polynomial in δ 1 of the binary mixture. A quartic expression of W in terms of solvent solubility parameter was found for predicting the solubility of satranidazole in propylene glycol-water mixtures.
