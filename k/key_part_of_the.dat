5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian narrative of the campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts {{in the early years}} after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic and desperate action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the fighting has been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on both sides, and now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders.|$|E

5|$|The {{genetic code}} is a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis.

In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E

5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds {{only once every}} two to five years, when {{a certain type of}} plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to language development, joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of joint attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early joint attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

5|$|Malmö FF's first stadium was Malmö IP, {{which was}} shared with arch-rivals IFK Malmö. The team played {{here from the}} {{founding}} of the club in 1910, until 1958. The stadium still exists today, albeit with lower capacity, and is now used by women's team FC Rosengård, who were previously the women's section of Malmö FF. Capacity in 2012 is 7,600, but attendances were usually much higher when Malmö FF played there. For the last season in 1957, the average attendance was 15,500. The club's record attendance at Malmö IP is 22,436 against Helsingborgs IF on 1 June 1956. The stadium is still considered a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's history, as it was here that the club were founded, played their first 47 seasons, and won five Swedish championships.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{generated}} further {{controversy in}} September 2005, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode {{a week after}} Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with Ofcom. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur. The New Orleans song was edited out of all future showings, and remains absent from all Channel 4 airings as of March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Various studios {{rejected}} the project, until Glimcher persuaded Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Studios, to financially back the film {{on a low}} budget.

Following Lucille Ball's death in 1989, Glimcher was unable to secure the rights to use footage for the film. After Universal cancelled production of The Mambo Kings, the project moved to Warner Bros. Glimcher met with the studio's president Terry Semel, who introduced him to producer Arnon Milchan. Milchan agreed to co-finance the film through his production company Regency Enterprises and the French-based film studio Le Studio Canal+. The film was allocated a budget of $15.5 million.|$|E

5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England {{as a result of the}} Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade to build.|$|E

5|$|Other {{important}} {{days were}} commemorated at memorials around the world. Australia commemorated Armistice Day, but held larger scale commemorations around Anzac Day on 25 April. Anzac Day was founded {{to remember the}} Gallipoli campaign, and memorials were erected for the first ceremonies in 1916; dawn services at local memorials formed a <b>key</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national event. In France, the authorities in Verdun organised the Fêtes de la Victoire on 23 June, centring on the city's memorials and the nearby ossuary. These usually involved senior French military figures and pageantry. Ceremonies to honour the fallen {{of the battle of}} the Somme were held by the British at the Somme memorials on the Sunday nearest 1 July throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Romania – inter-war years, the Feast of the Ascension used to commemorate the war dead. Termed Heroes' Day, civic processions under central guidance from the Societata took place to the local war memorials. The 6 August was also used to commemorate the battle of Mărăşeşti at the site. Many of these adopted the British use of collective silence during the memorial ceremonies.|$|E
