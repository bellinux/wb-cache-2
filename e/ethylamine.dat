40|$|One bond {{coupling}} constants {{were measured}} {{as a function}} of temperature for bonds between carbon and carbon (l J CC) and, less commonly, hydrogen (l J CH) or fluorine (l J CF). Precisions of ± 0. 01 Hz were achieved using double isotopic substitution (for l J CC) and least squares curve fitting. Temperatures were measured to ± 0. 5 K using carbon chemical shift thermometers. Molecules having no conformational equilibria showed substituent, temperature and solvent effects on the couplings, throwing doubt on some conformational uses of higher order couplings. Comparison of l J CC values and their temperature dependences (ΔJ/ΔT) for some amines and appropriate models allowed determination of conformational free energies (ΔGÂ°). ΔGÂ° was estimated for some <b>ethylamines</b> (trans and gauche conformers) and for piperidine (axial and equatorial N-H). The method depends on the differences in l J CC for a bond in an ethyl group (<b>ethylamines)</b> or ring (piperidines) according to whether it is cis, gauche, or trans to a nitrogen lone pair. Conformational information was generally obtained from comparison of absolute l J CC, values, not from ΔJ/ΔT. A hindered internal rotation of the ethyl in r - 2, c - 4, c - 6 -trimethyl- N -ethylpiperidine was discovered; l J CC was observed for separate conformers at low temperature and ΔGÂ° was estimated at room temperature. The result was compared with ΔGÂ°s obtained using other carbon n. m. r. methods, i. e., measurement of line broadening, integrated resonances at low temperature and averaged chemical shifts. Axial /equatorial equilibr were studied by known n. m. r. methods for N -ethyl- and analogous N -methyl-piperidines. l J CC is dependent on conformation in [(l 3 C 2) ethyl] benzene and its mesityl analogue; mathematical treatment should provide an estimate of the barrier to rotation in ethylbenzene. l J CC is dependent on conformation in ketones (e. g. diethylketone) and on the configuration (syn/anti) of their derivatives. Hyperconjugation with unsaturated centres explains the conformational dependences of l J CC, analogous to those known for l J CH. </p...|$|R

A mechanistic model for enantiodifferentiation is proposed, involving two H-bond interactions (N–H···O and O–H···O) between the deprotonated reactant and the protonated chiral modifier.

NMR and FTIR investigations, and ab initio calculations, of reactant–modifier interactions support the suggested model.

40|$|Abstract- The {{development}} of effective methods for promoting {{the addition of}} ammonia and amines to olefins to yield alkylamines {{has long been a}} challenge in catalysis. We have found that alkali metal amides (rather than transition metal complexes) can be surprisingly active homogeneous catalysts for the amination of olefins. The reaction of diethylamine with ethylene to yield triethylamine in the presence of lithium diethylamide and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamjne was studied {{as a model for the}} reaction of ammonia with ethylene. It proceeds at 70 — 90 °C and 6 - 10 atm, with the rate limiting step being the addition of the diethylamide Et 2 N, nucleophile to the olefin. Sodium and potassium diethylamides are initially even more active catalysts but degrade as the reaction proceeds. Solutions of cesium and rubidium amides are remarkably active catalysts for the reaction of ethylene with ammonia at ca. 100 °C, and 110 atm pressure to yield a mixture of <b>ethylamines</b> with monoethylamine being the predominant product. Low melting mixtures of alkali metal amide salts also catalyze the amination of ethylene and propylene. Fundamental considerations regarding the effectiveness and limitations of these amide catalyzed olefin amination reactions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{elementary}} reaction steps in solid acid catalyzed amination of light alcohols are critically compared using hydrogen mordenite as (model) catalyst {{and the open}} mechanistic questions have been addressed. Transient kinetic experiments combined with in situ infrared spectroscopy and isotopic labeling techniques were the main experimental means to provide answers to these questions. While we have shown before that the ammonium ions rapidly react with methanol to produce methylammonium ions, these results show that also methoxy groups formed from methanol at strong Brønsted acid sites under reaction conditions are very low, it is concluded that {{the contribution of the}} methoxy group amination to the amine formation is very small. The rate determining step for the overall reaction is the ammonia mediated removal of the alkylammonium ions from the zeolite. It is shown that two interconnected reaction steps govern this, i. e., alkyl group scavenging by ammonia/amines and ammonia/amine adsorption assisted desorption of alkylammonium ions. The combination of both the steps determines the observed rates and selectivities to the different amines. The formation of alkenes in the synthesis of larger alkylamines over strongly acidic catalysts is shown to largely result from Hofmann elimination (decomposition of <b>ethylamines)</b> and not from elimination reactions of the alcohol reactant...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} described {{that several}} 2 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -substituted phenyl) <b>ethylamines</b> (PEAs), including 4 -I= 2 C-I, 4 -Br= 2 C-B, and 4 -CH 3 = 2 C-D analogs, are partial agonists at 5 -HT 2 C receptors, and show low or even negligible intrinsic efficacy at 5 -HT 2 A receptors. These results raised the proposal that these drugs may act as 5 -HT 2 antagonists. To test this hypothesis, Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with the rat clones for 5 -HT 2 A or 5 -HT 2 C receptors. The above-mentioned PEAs and its 4 -H analog (2 C-H) blocked the 5 -HT-induced currents at 5 -HT 2 A, {{but not at}} the 5 -HT 2 C receptor, revealing 5 -HT 2 receptor subtype selectivity. The 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonism required a 2 -min preincubation to attain maximum inhibition. All PEAs tested shifted the 5 -HT concentration–response curves to the right and downward. Their potencies varied with the nature of the C(4) substituent; the relative rank order of their 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist potency was 2 C-I> 2 C-B> 2 C-D> 2 C-H. The present results demonstrate that in X. laevis oocytes, a series of 2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -substituted PEAs blocked the 5 -HT 2 A but not the 5 -HT 2 C receptor-mediated responses. As an alternative hypothesis, we suggest that the psychostimulant activity of the PEAs may not be exclusively associated with partial or full 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonism...|$|R

The methoxy functions in positions 3 and 9 or 10 were cleaved with BBr 3 and the free hydroxy groups converted into the acetates. The enantiomers of the most potent derivatives were separated by liquid chromatography on triacetylcellulose. All of the compounds tested bind to the calf uterine estrogen receptor. The relative binding affinities (RBA) ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 9 (17 beta-estradiol: RBA = 100) and were dependent on {{the position of the}} oxygen function in the indole moiety. The 3, 10 -diacetoxy derivatives showed higher RBA values than the corresponding 3, 9 -substituted tetracycles. There was no major difference in binding affinity between (+) - and (-) -enantiomers. Computer-assisted molecular modeling studies showed that the chiral carbon atom 6 of the indoloisoquinoline is likely to mimic the C- 11 atom of estradiol. In the mouse uterine weight test, only the 3, 10 -diacetoxy series exhibited weak estrogenic activity at higher doses. The antiestrogenic effects found with all the compounds varied considerably. Maximum inhibition of estrone-stimulated uterine growth was found for the ethyl derivative 7 d (80 % with 250 micrograms/animal per day). All derivatives strongly inhibited the growth of human breast cancer cells in vitro.

Cytostatic activity was higher for the 3, 9 -substituted indoloisoquinolines than for the 3, 10 -analogues and dependent on the length of the alkyl group at C- 6.

When the enantiomers of the ethyl (7 c), propyl (7 e), and butyl derivative were studied, a strong difference in activity was observed between the stereoisomers.
