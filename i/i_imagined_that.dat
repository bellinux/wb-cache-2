500|$|To other reviewers, Captain Scarlet {{remains a}} [...] "camp classic" [...] that, in Bould's opinion, relates well to other Anderson {{productions}} {{due to a}} common depiction of [...] "a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity." [...] He also states that Captain Scarlet espouses [...] "Euro-cool consumerism". The concept of world government is common to Anderson's work and was inspired by his thoughts on the matter at the time: [...] "I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future... we had the United Nations and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the world would come together {{and there would be}} a world government." [...] Peter Wright, on the series' depiction of technology, notes the [...] "qualified technophilia" [...] that it shares with Thunderbirds.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, {{during his}} {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. stated he recorded over 120 songs and had to narrow it down to 16 that would make Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head. T.I. claimed that he's going to take unused material from Heavy is the Head and arrange it into a new album titled Trouble Man: He Who Wears the Crown: [...] "Well, I had so much music man. I recorded like 120-something songs for this project, and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that,</b> you know, if just giving the amount of music that we had left over that we weren't able to put on this project, that we’d do a sequel. So, you know, the sequel to this album will be He Who Wears the Crown. That’s {{the primary reason for}} the subtitle. That's the purpose of the sequel, so we’ll have a platform to display and release these songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me {{that he was going to}} get in shape and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E

60|$|Although knowing him so well, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> he, like me, {{was well}} nigh {{overcome}} with terror, and intent only on saving his own skin without giving heed to whatsoever might come upon his companions.|$|E

60|$|She flushed darkly. <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> she saw {{her husband}} {{installed}} in a luxurious suite of rooms, dining at one smart restaurant after another, and she pictured his days spent at race-meetings and his evenings at the play.|$|E
60|$|I paused, for a {{new look}} had come into Benjy's eyes. He began that peculiar, {{sympathetic}} laugh of the negro, which catches and doubles on itself, and <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> a new admiration for me dawned on his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I supposed. At least, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{he must be}} mistaken. But a man in love is {{an optimistic}} fool, of course, and I had loved you ever since you got into my cab that morning [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|I promised, and escaped. On {{the veranda}} I came upon Miss Thorn {{surrounded}} {{by some of}} her uncle's guests. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> she was bored, for she looked it.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. MacAndrew {{tightened}} her lips. <b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> she {{had never}} looked with approval on her sister's leaning towards persons who cultivated the arts. She spoke of [...] "culchaw" [...] derisively.|$|R

6000|$|... "Said I {{wanted to}} see you?" [...] {{repeated}} Susy, with her blue eyes lifted in celestial scorn and wonderment. [...] "Said I {{wanted to see}} you? Are you not mistaken, Mr. Brant? Really, <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> you came here to see ME." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not ask me," [...] cried I, {{putting my}} hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; [...] "HE can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!"

60|$|For once I had {{the best}} of matters. Louis was evidently in a highly nervous state, from which <b>I</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> things {{connected}} with their undertaking, whatever it might be, had reached a critical stage.

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> Gov.

The Supreme Court, with all the prestige of its position in American public life, could have brought closure to this matter. But instead, by straddling the fence, the court has produced a combination of holdings that can please no one.|$|R
