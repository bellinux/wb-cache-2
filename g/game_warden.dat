25|$|In 1885, the {{territorial}} legislature established the Montana territorial Fish and Game Commission. The state's first state <b>game</b> <b>warden</b> {{was hired in}} 1889, {{the same year that}} Montana became a state. Under Montana state law, each county was also authorized to hire one <b>game</b> <b>warden,</b> but a lack of funds and interest led to no wardens being hired. By 1900, only four of Montana's then-24 counties had game wardens.|$|E

25|$|The Montana State Legislature {{established}} the state Fish and Game Board in 1895. Governor John E. Rickards appointed the first Fish and Game Commissioners on March 4, 1895. The Fish and Game Board hired its first state <b>game</b> <b>warden,</b> R.A. Wagner, in July 1898. Hunting and fishing licenses were imposed on out-of-state residents in 1901. The funds from sale of licenses and fines imposed on violators partially funded the state's court system, {{and in its}} first year more than 300 justices of the peace were supported by the law. The Fish and Game commissioners recommended the establishment of a Fish and Game Department, and the legislature created this agency on April 1, 1901. The <b>game</b> <b>warden</b> and his deputies were all authorized law enforcement officers. Fish and game districts were created and eight deputy game wardens authorized for each district. Hunting and fishing licenses for in-state residents were required in 1905.|$|E

Half the state's game wardens had less than five years of experience.|$|E

The best known footprints were found in a soybean field belonging to local filling station owner Scott Keith. They were scrutinized by <b>game</b> <b>warden</b> Carl Galyon, who was unable to confirm their authenticity.

25|$|The 1894 Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act {{introduced}} {{regulations that}} severely limited {{the ability of}} the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples to access wildlife on their traditional territories. By the 1920s, Aboriginals were excluded from hunting and trapping grounds contained in Wood Buffalo National Park. The establishment of a <b>game</b> <b>warden</b> service in the park allowed for direct surveillance and supervisory control over Aboriginal hunters. As a result, the most basic elements of the Aboriginal subsistence cycle, including seasonal movements, fur trapping, and the gathering of food, were redefined as criminal activities through federal game regulations. According to historian John Sandlos, attitudes towards Cree, Dene, and Inuit hunters were socially constructed and flawed due to observer bias, racial stereotyping, and inaccurate reporting by park officials. Furthermore, Sandlos emphasizes that incidents of wildlife overkill does not undermine the right or ability of Aboriginal hunters to manage local bison populations in partnership with government experts.|$|E
25|$|On 27 July the 7th ARVN Division {{initiated}} operations {{designed to}} sweep for Viet Cong {{from east to}} west, north of Highway 4. The search would cover the territory around the Ap Bac base area and in the eastern portion of the Vietcong Base Area 470. On 28 July the Mobile Riverine Force would move into the Cam Son base area; on 29 July one or more battalions of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps would move into the Ban Long base area. The US 9th Division was to place the 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry (Mechanized), under the operational control of the 2d Brigade for the Cam Son operation, and was to hold the 3d Battalion, 39th Infantry, on call at that battalion's Long An base camp. The 1st Brigade, US 25th Division, was to arrive at Dong Tam on 28 July for commitment under the operational control of the 9th US Division. The 7th ARVN Division was given the 44th Ranger Battalion by the commander of South Vietnam's IV Corps for insertion by helicopter into the northwestern portion of Cam Son on 28 July. The US Navy Task Force 116 (<b>Game</b> <b>Warden)</b> was to patrol the My Tho River from My Tho to Sa Dec with 30 river patrol boats.

25|$|Former <b>game</b> <b>warden</b> turned film-maker, Simon Trevor, {{produced}} {{a number of}} award-winning films for Survival during a 30-year association with the series. Several of his films were shot in and around Kenya's Tsavo National Park, where he has his home, and featured the ongoing struggle faced by the park's animals, especially elephants, {{to survive in the}} face of natural and man-made threats. His film about the work of Daphne Sheldrick, widow of Tsavo's first warden, was the heart-warming story of her efforts to save orphaned elephants and other animals. Together They Stand was an intimate portrait of the African dwarf mongoose and was Survival’s first Golden Panda winner at the Wildscreen film festival. Trevor later highlighted renewed threats to the elephant population from poaching and culling in Elephants of Tsavo: Love and Betrayal, an account drawing on his film record of Tsavo’s wildlife shot over three decades. Hell or High Water showed what happened to animals and their habitats when Tanzania’s Great Ruaha River ran dry {{for the first time in}} living memory, and then torrential rains transformed the river into a torrent. Trevor, who also directed and filmed wildlife sequences for Hollywood movies including Out of Africa and Gorillas in the Mist, subsequently set up the African Environmental Film Foundation to produce educational films for Africans on environmental issues.|$|E
