5000|$|The R-W {{explanation}} of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated. In blocking (see [...] "phenomena" [...] above), CS1 is paired with a US until conditioning is complete. Then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus (CS2) appears together with CS1, and both are followed by the US. Finally CS2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about CS2 was “blocked” by the initial learning about CS1. The R-W model explains this by saying that after the <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning,</b> CS1 fully predicts the US. Since {{there is no difference}} between what is predicted and what happens, no new learning happens on the additional trials with CS1+CS2, hence CS2 later yields no response.|$|E
50|$|Rapid reacquisition may be {{partially}} {{an effect of}} ABA renewal, whereby an animal (undergoing conditional learning) learns that the <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning</b> trials with the CS-US pairings {{are part of an}} original context of conditioning, whereas the more recent presentations of the CS alone are part of the context of extinction. Thus, when CS-US pairings are resumed post-extinction, they put the animal back into the mindset of the original conditioning context, and this contextual cue aids in reacquiring the CR more quickly than the initial learning. As such, rapid reacquisition will be produced when reinforced initial learning trials create a contextual cue, that in future acquisition trials gets activated and brings about the renewal of responding, at a quicker rate than the initial response learning.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{contribution}} of sweet beverages to weight gain in children is controversial; {{the impact of}} these beverages on caloric adjustment needs clarification. Objective: We studied the influence of energy-density (ED) conditioning on the liking for sweet beverages and caloric adjustment after their consumption in children. Design: We used a within-subject design. Forty-four 8 - 11 -y-old children were exposed to the following 2 distinctly flavored, sweetened beverages: a high-energy (HE) version (150 kcal) and a no-energy (NE) version (0 kcal). During a 4 -wk <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning</b> period, children were exposed either 2 or 7 times to each beverage. After a 3 -wk stability period (without exposure), children were exposed 3 times to both beverages with a reversed association between the ED and flavor (4 -wk reversed-conditioning period). Flavor liking and food intake during meals after the consumption of each beverage were assessed before and after each period. Results: After the <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the liking for both beverages increased (P < 0. 001). After the stability period, the liking for the HE flavor was higher than for the NE flavor (P = 0. 024). After the reversed conditioning, the liking for the flavor initially paired with the HE beverage tended to remain higher than for the NE flavor (P = 0. 089). Initially, energy intakes during the meal did not differ after the consumption of NE or HE beverages. After the <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning</b> and up {{until the end of the}} reversed conditioning, energy intakes were lower after the HE beverage than after the NE beverage regardless of the beverage flavor (eg, after reversal; caloric compensation score: 29 %). The number of exposures did not influence liking or energy intake. Conclusion: After the association between a flavor and ED and reversal of this association, liking may be first guided by ED and then the flavor firstly associated with ED, whereas the partial caloric compensation may consistently be guided by ED.

40|$|Continuous {{exposure}} to an aversive mixture was investigated {{as a means}} of maintaining aversion to vermeerbos in sheep subjected to the social influence of non-averted sheep. The use of an aversive mixture was based on a hypothesis that continuous {{exposure to}} an acceptable aversive mixture (containing both the aversive substance and the identification factors of vermeerbos mixed with maize meal) would tempt sheep to consume small quantities of the aversive mixture each day and that this would keep them averted to vermeerbos, despite the social influence of non-averted sheep. Persistent aversion to a vermeerbos-maize meal mixture (1 : 99 by mass) by sheep continuously exposed to such an aversive mixture, after an <b>initial</b> aversion <b>conditioning</b> with lithium chloride (LiCl, 160 mg/kg BM), was demonstrated. Aversion in adjacent controls not exposed to the aversive mixture only lasted for some time. A similar result was obtained when sheep were challenged for intake of a pure stand of established vermeerbos. Three sheep continuously exposed to an aversive mixture after an <b>initial</b> aversion <b>conditioning</b> totally refused grazing the vermeerbos during a 42 -day trial, despite the social influence of three non-averted control sheep grazing vermeerbos on an adjacent site. These results were confirmed by a second replication the following year. Joint grazing for an hour a day by averted and non-averted sheep during the last seven days of this replication also resulted in total avoidance of vermeerbos by the averted animals, despite continued intake of vermeerbos by the control sheep.

40|$|Two new four-element {{fast wave}} current drive antennas have been {{installed}} on DIII-D. These antennas {{are designed for}} 10 -s pulses at 2 MW each in the frequency range of 30 to 120 MHz. Each element comprises two poloidal segments fed in parallel in order to optimize plasma coupling at {{the upper end of}} the frequency range. The antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the vacuum vessel, in ports designated 0 {degrees} and 180 {degrees} after their toroidal angle. Each antenna array is fed by a single transmitter. The power is first split two ways by means of a 3 -dB hybrid coupler, then each of these lines feeds a resonant loop connecting a pair of array elements. The power transfer during asymmetric phasing is shunted between resonant loops by a decoupler. The resonant loops are fitted with line stretchers so that multiple frequencies of operation are possible without reconfiguring the transmission line. Commissioning of these antennas has been underway since June 1994. Several deficiencies in the transmission line system were uncovered during <b>initial</b> vacuum <b>conditioning,</b> including problems with the transmission line insulators and with the drive rods for the variable elements. The former was solved by replacing the original alumina insulators, and the latter has been avoided during operation to date by positioning the tuners to avoid high voltage appearing on the drive rods. A modified design for the drive rods will be implemented before RF operations resume operation June 1995. New transmitters were procured from ABB for the new antennas and were installed in parallel with the antenna installation.

40|$|Cannabidiol (CBD) {{has been}} {{established}} to have both acute and long-lasting effects to reduce fear memory expression. The long-lasting impact might be mediated by an enhancement of memory extinction or an impairment of memory reconsolidation. Here, we directly compared the effects of i. p. injections of cannabidiol (10 mg/kg) {{with those of the}} NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 (0. 1 mg/kg) and partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS; 15 mg/kg) {{in order to determine the}} mnemonic basis of long-term fear reduction. We showed that under conditions of strong fear conditioning, CBD reduced contextual fear memory expression both acutely during the extinction session as well as later at a fear retention test. The latter test reduction was replicated by DCS, but MK- 801 instead elevated test freezing. In contrast, when <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning</b> was weaker, CBD and MK- 801 had similar effects to increase freezing at the fear retention test relative to vehicle controls, whereas DCS had no observable impact. This pattern of results is consistent with CBD enhancing contextual fear memory extinction when the <b>initial</b> <b>conditioning</b> is strong, but impairing extinction when conditioning is weak. This bidirectional effect of CBD may be related to stress levels induced by conditioning and evoked at retrieval during extinction, rather than the strength of the memory per se...|$|E

However, sole reliance on this measure includes the de facto assumption that any locomotor activity reflects an absence of fear.

In females, darting exhibits {{the characteristics of a}} learned fear behavior, appearing during the CS period as conditioning proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction. This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear conditioning studies, particularly in females, and it suggests that conditioned fear behavior is more diverse than previously appreciated. Moreover, rats that darted during <b>initial</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> exhibited lower freezing during the second day of extinction testing, suggesting that females employ distinct and adaptive fear response strategies that improve long-term outcomes...|$|R

The authors then tested whether the seal {{would be able to}} generalize spontaneously to altered signals. It responded correctly to center pointing and head turning, center upper body turning, and off-center pointing but not to head turning and eye movements alone. The seal also responded correctly to brief ipsilateral and contralateral points from center and lateral positions. Pointing gestures did not cause the seal to select an object placed centrally behind it.

Shifts in body alignment, pointing gesture orientation, head alignment, and gazing direction (eyes alone) can alter the focus of attention in human social interactions.
