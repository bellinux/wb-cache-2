40|$|Recently, the {{potential}} of the electromagnetic forming process has been introduced to form the shallow longitudinal reinforcement ribs in the lateral walls of roll formed parts, made of high strength steel sheets of 340 MPa tensile stress grade [1]. However, it seems that the application may not be easy for high strength steel sheet because of its high tensile strength and low electric conductivity. In order to overcome this difficulty, aluminum <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> could be considered to enhance the formability of high strength steel sheets in the electromagnetic forming process. In this paper, in order to investigate the effect of aluminum <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> on forming height of high strength steel sheet in electromagnetic forming process, DP 780 workpiece sheets were formed into a hemi elliptical protrusion shape with Al 1050 <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> of various thicknesses and sizes. Experiments were performed with a flat spiral coil actuator connected to an electromagnetic forming system. The results, the aluminum <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> helps to increase the forming height of high strength steel sheets. In addition, the forming height of high strength steel sheet increases as the thickness and size of a <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> increases...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{observations}} of shock-induced radiation from oxides, silicates and metals of geophysical interest constrain the shock-compressed temperature of these materials. In these experiments, a projectile impacts a target {{consisting of a}} metal <b>driver</b> <b>plate,</b> a metal film or foil layer, and a transparent window. We investigate {{the relationship between the}} temperature inferred from the observed radiation, and the temperatures of different high-pressures states (e. g. shocked state) of the shock-compressed film (or foil) and window. Deviations of the temperature in each target component away from that of their respective shock-compressed states occur because of (1) shock-impedance mismatch between target components, (2) thermal mismatch between target components, (3) surface roughness at target interfaces, and (4) conduction within and between target components. In particular, conduction may affect the temperature of the film/foil material at the film/foil-window interface, a major thermal radiation source in the target, on the time scale of the experiments. To be observed, radiation from sources at the film/foil-window interface or in the shocked window material must propagate through (1) the shocked window material, (2) the shock front, (3) the unshocked window material, and (4) the unshocked window free surface. Consequently, the observed intensity of target radiation sources is affected by the optical properties of each region. In particular, the source radiation intensity may be greatly reduced due to absorption in the shocked and/or unshocked window material, and/or only partial transmission through the film/foil-window interface, shock front and/or unshocked window free surface. To illustrate various aspects of the model, we apply it to radiation data from targets composed of an Fe <b>driver</b> <b>plate,</b> and Fe film or foil layer, and either an Al_ 2 O_ 3 or LiF window layer...|$|E

40|$|Hugoniot {{data in the}} 4 - to 250 -kb {{stress range}} were {{obtained}} for quartzite and novaculite, sandstones of varying porosity, single-crystal calcite, marble, porous and nonporous limestone, several plagioclases of varying composition, and a basalt. Conventional plane-wave, in-contact explosive assemblies were used; the shock state was computed from measured shock velocities; particle velocities are inferred from either specimen or <b>driver</b> <b>plate</b> free-surface motion. Impedence-match solutions were obtained for porous rock. High values of the Hugoniot elastic limit were observed in nonporous rocks—approximately 40 to 90 kb in quartzite and novaculite, 40 to 50 kb in the plagioclase rocks, and 15 to 25 kb in calcite and marble. Reduced values were found for porous rocks, approximately 5 kb in sandstone and limestone. Phase transitions are inferred at 30, 45, and 95 kb in calcite, and 22, 45, and 90 kb in marble and limestone. For calcite these are indicated by multiple shock fronts. Anomalously low volumes achieved by sandstone shocked to above approximately 40 kb, and high calculated shock temperatures, suggest partial conversion to coesite or stishovite. High-pressure states observed in basalt and plagioclase agree with previously reported states for gabbro [Hughes and McQueen, 1958] above 300 kb when both data are plotted in terms of relative volume. The previously observed slope-change of the gabbro Hugoniot is believed to result from an elastic wave of perhaps 50 -kb amplitude which is overdriven at 300 kb...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of waves and flows is a challenging topic where a complete resolution has been {{frustrated by the}} essential nonlinear features in the hydrodynamic case. Even {{in the case of}} EM waves in flowing media, the results are subtle. For a simple shear flow of constant n fluid, incident radiation is shown to be reflected and refracted in an analogous manner to Snell's law. However, the beam intensities differ and the system has an asymmetry in that an internal reflection gap opens at steep incident angles nearly oriented with the shear. For EM waves these effects are generally negligible in real systems but they introduce the topic at a reduced level of complexity of the more interesting acoustic case. Acoustic streaming is suggested, both from theory and experimental data, to be associated with vorticity generation at the driver itself. Bounds on the vorticity in bulk and nonlinear effects demonstrate that the bulk sources, even with attenuation, cannot drive such a strong flow. A review of the velocity scales in the problem suggest that a variation of the Scholte wave at the driver-fluid interface with local cavitation on the decompression phase creates a lateral flow of fluid that generates the stream and imparts the vorticity from the <b>driver</b> <b>plate.</b> In the case of Darcy flow in sintered media, an analysis of data suggests that acoustically enhanced flow {{may be the result of}} surface effects that narrow channels that are cleared by ultrasonic cavitation...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of shock-induced radiation from oxides, silicates and metals of geophysical interest constrain the shock-compressed temperature of these materials. In these experiments, a projectile impacts a target {{consisting of a}} metal <b>driver</b> <b>plate,</b> metal film or foil layer, and transparent window. We investigate {{the relationships between the}} temperature inferred from the observed radiation and the temperature of the shock-compressed film or foil and/or window. Changes of the temperature field in each target component away from that of their respective shock-compressed states occur because of: 1) shock-impedance mismatch between target components, 2) thermal mismatch between target components, 3) surface roughness at target interfaces, and 4) conduction within and between target components. In particular, conduction may affect the temperature of the film/foil-window interface on the time scale of the experiments, and so control the intensity and history of the dominant thermal radiation sources in the target. We use this type of model to interpret the radiation emitted by a variety of shock-compressed materials and interfaces. In a series of experiments on films (1 μm thick) and foils (10 - 100 μm thick) of Fe in contact with Al_ 2 O_ 3 and LIF windows, Fe at Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interfaces releases from experimental shock-compressed states between 245 and 300 GPa to interface states at pressures between 190 and 230 GPa, respectively, and temperatures between 4000 and 8000 K, respectively. These temperatures are ≈ 200 - 1500 K above model calculations for Fe experiencing no reshock at ideal (smooth) Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interfaces. We attribute this discrepancy to localized dissipation at the Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interface, producing higher interface temperatures than uniform compression and energy transfer. This behavior is observed for both Fe foils and films. Both 190 GPa, localized heating due to gaps or interface-surface roughness does not apparently affect the temperature of Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interfaces. In contrast, from the same range of shock states, Fe at Fe-LIF interfaces releases to states between 130 and 160 GPa (because it has a lower shock impedance than Al_ 2 O_ 3); both the data and model imply that Fe-L 1 F interfaces respond ideally to shock-compression up to 140 GPa (where the data end). Both the Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 data and the model suggest that the degree of reshock and localized heating is strongly pressure-dependent above the solid Fe-liquid Fe phase boundary. LiF appears to be a more ideal window than Al_ 2 O_ 3 also because it is a poorer thermal inertia (i. e., kρc_P, where k is the thermal conductivities, ρ is the mass density, and c_P is the specific heat at constant pressure) match to Fe than is Al_ 2 O_ 3. In the absence of energy sources and significant energy flux {{from other parts of the}} target, the rate of change of the film/window or foil/window, interface temperature, dT_(INT) (t) /dt, is proportional to -μexp(-μ 2 ^), where μ Ξ δ_(FW) / 2 √K_Ft, δ_(FW) is the thickness of the high-temperature (reshocked) zone in the film/foil layer at the film/foil-window interface, K_F, is the thermal diffusivity of the film/foil material, and 0 ≤ t ≤ t(exp) (t_(exp) is the time scale of the experiment, 200 - 400 ns). On this basis, the temperature of a thin (δ_(FW) > 2 √K_ft_(exp) layer. We estimate √K_Ft_(exp) 10 μm for Fe under the conditions of Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 and Fe-LiF interfaces at high pressure. In this case, a 100 -μm-thick reshocked Fe layer would relax very little, remaining near T(INT) (0) on the time scale of the experiment, while a 1 -μm-thick reshocked Fe layer would relax on a time scale of ≾ 10 nsec, which is much less than t_(exp), to a temperature just above T(INT) (∞), i. e., the temperature of the ideal (smooth) interface. Greybody model fits to radiation from an Fe film-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interface resolve a gradually increasing effective greybody emissivity, ε_(gb) (t), and a gradually decreasing greybody temperature, T_(gb) (t). This behavior is characteristic of most Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 interface experiments. The decrease of T_(gb) (t) can be explained in terms of the reshock model for the film/foil-window interface temperature, T_(INT) (t). For this experiment, the model implies that the thickness of the reshocked film layer, δ_(FW), is approximately equal to the conduction length scale in the film, √K_Ft_(exp) (10 μm for Fe). Further, assuming 1) T_(gb) (t) = T_(INT) (t), 2) the thermal inertia of the film is an order of magnitude less than the window, andδ_(FW) ≾ 2 √K_ft_(exp), the greybody constrains the temperature rise due to localized heating through reshock ΔT_(FW) to ≾ 2000 K. A slight decrease of the Al_ 2 O_ 3 absorption coefficient upon shock compression can explain the slight increase of ε_(gb) (t) with time; this may be consistent with the low-pressure observation that the refractive index of Al_ 2 O_ 3 seems to decrease with pressure. In contrast to the Fe-Al_ 2 O_ 3 results, greybody fits to radiation from an Fe foil-LiF interface show a relatively constant greybody temperature, and a decreasing greybody emissivity. The constant greybody temperature implies a constant interface temperature, as expected for an interface experiencing minimal reshock, while the decaying ε_(gb) (t) is consistent with a shock-induced increase in the absorption coefficient of LiF. Setting T_(INT) = T_(gb) (0), we fit a simplified version of the full radiation model to these data and obtain an estimate of the absorption coefficient (100 m^(- 1)) of LIF shock-compressed to 122 GPa. Shock-compressed MgO radiates thermally at temperatures between 2900 and 3700 K in the 170 - 200 GPa pressure range. A simple energy-transport model of the shocked-MgO-targets allows us to distinguish between different shock-induced radiation sources in these targets and to estimate spectral absorption-coefficients, a_(λMgO), for shocked MgO (e. g., at 203 GPa, a_(λMgO) 6300, 7500, 4200 and 3800 m^(- 1), at 450, 600, 750 and 900 nm, respectively). The experimentally inferred temperatures of the shock-compressed states of MgO are consistent with temperatures calculated for MgO, assuming that 1) it deforms as an elastic fluid, 2) it has a Dulong-Petit value for specific heat at constant volume in its shocked-state, 3) it undergoes no phase transformation below 200 GPa, and 4) the product of the equilibrium thermodynamic Gruneisen's parameter, γ, and the mass density, ρ, is a constant and equal to 4729. 6 kg/m^ 3. Optical radiation from shock-compressed crystal CaMgSi_ 2 O_ 6 (diopside) constrains crystal CaMgSi_ 2 O_ 6 Hugoniot temperatures of 3500 - 4800 K in the 150 - 170 GPa pressure range, while glass CaMgSi_ 2 O_ 6, with a density 87...|$|E

However, in the summer of 1944, the Germans experienced a shortage of manganese and had to switch to using high-carbon steel alloyed with nickel, which made armor very brittle, especially at the seam welds. The performance of the 122 mm AP shells of the IS-2 against the Panther improved considerably.

40|$|The cost of {{manufacturing}} bipolar plates {{is a major}} component to the overall cost structure of a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack. To achieve the commercialization of PEM fuel cells, a high volume and low cost manufacturing process for the bipolar plate must be developed. American Trim has identified high velocity electromagnetic forming as a suitable technology to manufacture metallic fuel cell bipolar plates, because of its low capital cost, flexible tooling and rapid prototyping capability. Through the support from the State of Ohio Third Frontier Fuel Cell Program, a group of collaborators consisting of American Trim, The Ohio State University and General Motors have developed a commercially viable prototype production process to manufacture metallic fuel cell bipolar plates in which electromagnetic coils and forming dies were integrated. To manufacture fuel cell bipolar plates, a metal sheet is accelerated by electromagnetic force to impact against, and take the shape of, the forming die surface.

An experimental study has been carried out in the newly commissioned Ocean Basin at Plymouth University’s COAST Lab. The falling block comprises a rigid impact plate connected to two <b>driver</b> <b>plates</b> and its total mass can be varied between 32 kg and 52 kg. The impact plate is 0. 25 m long, 0. 25 m wide and 0. 012 m high. The impact velocity is varied between 4 m/s and 7 m/s. Preliminary results of the impact tests are presented here. Visualised results show that there are significant differences between jet formation after impact of the plate in pure water and in aerated water. There is significant reduction of the maximum pressures from those measured in pure water to those measured in aerated water...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} kinematic plate tectonic model {{proposed that}} the outer shell (lithosphere) of the Earth is divided into {{a small number of}} nearly rigid plates that slide over the weak asthenosphere. The plates are the surface thermal boundary layer of upper-mantle or global-scale mantle convection, and the descending slabs are the primary active components of the convective system. The plate boundaries are generally narrow and are characterized by earthquakes and volcanoes. The plates, however, are not really rigid or undeformable, and the plate boundaries need not be localized (Dewey and Bird, 1970; Gordon, 2000; Anderson, 2001, 2002; Steinberger et al., 2004). Not only is the plate-slab system the main <b>driver</b> of <b>plate</b> tectonics and mantle convection, but much of the energy dissipation may be {{in this part of the}} system as well, rather than in mantle viscosity (Conrad and Hager, 2001). Plates may be held together by lateral compression-or absence of extension-rather than by strength or rigidity; rocks are strong in compression but have little resistance to extension. ...|$|R
50|$|Soviet ground trial testing {{conducted}} in May 1943 {{determined that the}} 8.8 cm KwK 36 gun could pierce the T-34-76 frontal beam nose of 140 mm thickness from 1500 m, and the front hull from 1500 m. A hit to the driver's hatch would force it to collapse inward and break apart. According to the WaPrüf, the Soviet T-34-85's upper glacis and turret front armour would be defeated between 100 and 1400 m, while the T-34's 85 mm gun would penetrate {{the front of a}} Tiger between 200 and 500 m. The 120 mm hull armour of the Soviet IS-2 model 1943 would be defeated between 100 and 300 m at the <b>driver's</b> front <b>plate</b> and nose. The IS-2's 122 mm gun could penetrate the Tiger's front armour from between 500 and 1500 m. However, according to Steven Zaloga, the IS-2 and Tiger I could each knock the other out in normal combat distances below 1,000 m. At longer ranges, the performance of each respective tank against each other was dependent on the crew and the combat situation.|$|R

5000|$|Dobyns now claims ATF {{management}} {{failed to}} support Dobyns {{and his family}} during the threat events. In 2008, ATF management suddenly withdrew the Dobyns family’s [...] "backstopping" [...] (protective countermeasures, cover stories, fake identities, untraceable <b>drivers</b> licenses, vehicle <b>plates</b> and other measures designed to {{make it difficult to}} discover a person’s true identity and living location). ATF claimed that the backstop measures were no longer justified, but Dobyns alleged that this was done purely as an act of illegal retaliation by his ATF bosses, with whom he had had a falling out over disagreements {{in the aftermath of the}} Hells Angels case. This action compromised Dobyns’ only remaining cover.|$|R
