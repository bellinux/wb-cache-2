30|$|The {{function}} of <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> {{can be seen}} in Fig. 1. In this case, the evolutionary algorithm is a differential evolution. The initial population is generated using differential evolution. This population, which must consist of natural numbers, is used for <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> purposes. The <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> then constructs the function {{on the basis of this}} population. This function is evaluated by its fitness function. If the termination condition is met, then the algorithm ends. If the condition is not met, then differential evolution creates a new population through the mutation and recombination processes. The whole process continues with the new population. At the end of the <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> process, it is assumed that one has a function that is the optimal solution for the given task.|$|R

30|$|Recently, simulation-based {{optimization}} {{has become}} a popular and efficient tool in many domains (Banks [21], Hagendorf et al. [22] and Figueira et al. [23]).It involves the optimization of model inputs by using simulation for the computation of parameters. Therefore, {{it is not necessary}} to provide an <b>explicit</b> <b>analytical</b> expression of the objective or constraint functions for optimization as in the case of analytical approach (Swisher et al. [24]; Fu [25]; Cassandras and Lafortune [26]). This is especially useful in some practical situations where the <b>explicit</b> <b>analytical</b> formulae are too complex to be deduced. In urban rail transit station domain, researchers used simulation-based optimization technique to evaluate and design different service facilities (Jiang et al.

30|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} usage of <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> and {{different}} fitness functions for software effort estimation. <b>Analytical</b> <b>programming</b> and differential evolution generate regression functions. These functions are evaluated by the fitness function {{which is part of}} differential evolution. The differential evolution requires a proper fitness function for effective optimization. The problem is in proper selection of the fitness function. <b>Analytical</b> <b>programming</b> and different fitness functions were tested to assess insight to this problem. Mean magnitude of relative error, prediction 25  %, mean squared error (MSE) and other metrics were as possible candidates for proper fitness function. The experimental results shows that means squared error performs best and therefore is recommended as a fitness function. Moreover, this work shows that <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> method is viable method for calibrating use case points method. All results were evaluated by standard approach: visual inspection and statistical significance.|$|R

30|$|The {{current study}} found that the {{prediction}} accuracy measurement, which measures the median, performs worse than those that measure the mean or total value. Surprisingly, the MMRE measurement, which has raised a lot of controversy in the effort estimation field, could be considered as an average suitable fitness function. The results also revealed that fitness functions have a reasonably influence on the calculated predictions. <b>Analytical</b> <b>programming</b> method {{can be seen as a}} viable method for effort estimation. However, this is true if and only if the UCP method is not optimized. The MSE fitness function could be seen as the best fitness function due to her statistical properties. The findings of this study have a number of important implications for future research of the using of <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> as an effort estimation technique. More research is required to determine the efficiency of <b>analytical</b> <b>programming</b> for this task.

40|$|A Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> and Dredging Knowledge{Base Expert{System (DKBES) determines a {{pipeline}} dredge's production and resulting cost and schedule. Pipeline dredge engineering presents {{a complex and}} dynamic process necessary to maintain navigable waterways. Dredge engineers use pipeline engineering and slurry transport principles to determine the production rate of {{a pipeline}} dredge system. Engineers then use cost engineering factors to determine {{the expense of the}} dredge project. Previous work in engineering incorporated an object{oriented expert{system to determine cost and scheduling of mid{rise building construction where data objects represent the fundamental elements of the construction process within the program execution. A previously developed dredge cost estimating spreadsheet program which uses hydraulic engineering and slurry transport principles determines the performance metrics of a dredge pump and pipeline system. This study focuses on combining hydraulic analysis with the functionality of an expert{system to determine the performance metrics of a dredge pump and pipeline system and its resulting schedule. Field data from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers pipeline dredge, Goetz, and several contract daily dredge reports show how accurately the DKBES can predict pipeline dredge production. Real{time dredge instrumentation data from the Goetz compares the accuracy of the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> to actual dredge operation. Comparison of the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> to pipeline daily dredge reports shows how accurately the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> can predict a dredge project's schedule over several months. Both of these comparisons determine the accuracy and validity of the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> and DKBES as they calculate the performance metrics of the pipeline dredge project. The results of the study determined that the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> compared closely to the Goetz eld data where only pump and pipeline hydraulics a ected the dredge production. Results from the dredge projects determined the Pipeline <b>Analytical</b> <b>Program</b> underestimated actual long{term dredge production. Study results identi ed key similarities and di erences between the DKBES and spreadsheet program in terms of cost and scheduling.
