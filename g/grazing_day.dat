40|$|In European grasslands, grazing and mowing {{regimes are}} major drivers of the {{maintenance}} of many wild species, either through direct or indirect effects. To date, both types of effects were studied separately, mainly at the field scale and with no quantification of performance. Objective {{of this study was}} to model the trade-offs between ecological and productive performance of a grassland agro-ecosystem at two nested scales i. e. field and farm scales. We developed a dynamic model linking grass dynamics controlled by grazing or mowing to stochastic population dynamics of two grassland bird species. Bird dynamics were driven by both direct and indirect effects of management. Viable control framework was used to predict productive and ecological performance. At field scale, results showed that the best ecological performance was obtained at intermediate levels of productive performance (60 to 108 <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> /ha /year). Above 108 <b>grazing</b> <b>days,</b> no <b>grazing</b> strategy was viable for either species due to the negative direct effects of management. Between 108 and 240 <b>grazing</b> <b>days,</b> the ecological-productive relationship showed a concave Pareto like frontier. Any improvement in productive performance entailed a strong decrease in ecological performance. As expected, at farm scale the best ecological performance was obtained with extensive farms. However, the ecological-productive relationship showed a convex Pareto like frontier indicating the occurrence of compensations among management regimes. In intensive farms, it was necessary to allocate 40 % of farm area in low-intensity grazing in order to compensate for the negative effects of mowing and high-intensity grazing on birds. However this land allocation involved a 25 % reduction in productive performance. Finally, we explore several forms of complementarities among farm types to improve overall performance...|$|R

The irrigation supplied the previous ten-year mean daily evapotranpiration (ET 0). It was adopted the rotational grazing, with grazing period of four days, resting period of 32 days and variable stocking, with grazing pressure of four kg of leaf dry matter per 100 kg live weight. The samples were collected during eight sequential days, corresponding to the four days of occupation of two plots, using four esophagus fistulated steers. During dry season, it was not observed irrigation influence on dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin content, and on “in vitro” digestibility of extrusated DM (IVDMD) for the two grass species, but it was observed higher organic matter (OM) content in extrusa from irrigated forages. During season, forages did not differ regarding to OM, CP, ADF and lignin contents. However, Napier grass showed higher NDF content and IVDMD. During rainy season, irrigation had no influence on chemical composition or IVDMD and Napier grass showed lower contents of NDF, ADF and lignin than Mombaça grass and similar contents of DM, OM and CP and IVDMD. Regression analysis revealed linear decrease {{in the content of}} DM, CP and “in vitro” digestibility of extrusa DM (IVDMD) as the occupation period of the plot advanced, which corresponded to 4. 0 % a day in protein content and to 2. 0 % a day in IVDMD.

Of the total area, ca. 3, 500 km 2 (extending from Taklang la towards the Tso Kar and pastures around Tso Moriri) was used by livestock from May to September, corresponding to 165 consecutive <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> (Figures  4 a and 5 a). These 80 families, with about 60, 000 SU, together migrated to Skagjung during winter to escape harsher conditions (October to April), undertaking a journey that lasted 20 days (both ways) and using pastures covering 987 km 2. The pastoralists typically spent 180 <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> at Skagjung before returning westward in the spring. This Skagjung area was used in winter due to its vast expanse of high biomass sedge meadows and reduced snow cover, hence providing plentiful forage for the livestock during this lean season. Another important feature of this wintering area was its proximity to the Chinese Tibetan side for trade, when the Indus River froze and provided access through its north bank to Tibet.

A comparison of grazing in a farming area and in a grazing reverse shows greater use of crop residues in the former and greater use of browse in the latter. In both areas the short grazing time compared with that of free-ranging animals may limit feed intake and contribute to low cattle productivity. On account of labour competition between herding and cropping and the need for tight herd control, grazing time in the growing season is restricted to only 5 h per day.

Each paddock was grazed for 3 consecutive days (D 1, D 2, D 3) followed by 33 days rest and evaluated from October 2005 to April 2006. Animal behavior (grazing time, bite rate and bite size/weight) was evaluated on each <b>grazing</b> <b>day.</b> While goats {{spent more time}} grazing on LR than HR (P= 0. 02), bite rate did not differ between treatments or among days (P= 0. 31) and averaged 26. 5 bites/min. In contrast, bite weight was greater in HR (0. 15 g/bite) than in LR (0. 12 g/bite), and decreased from D 1 to D 3 (P 0. 05) when intake was determined on a body weight or metabolic weight basis. Our {{findings are consistent with}} the general assumption that bite weight is a trade-off between quantity and quality of the herbage mass and is the main determinant of animal performance. More studies are needed to determine animal performance on the various treatments and to determine management strategies to provide a desirable balance between animal weight gain and pasture stability.

As massas de lâmina foliar total, verde e senescente pré-pastejo foram analisadas em seis repetições. O acúmulo e a eficiência de pastejo de lâmina foliar verde foram avaliados em delineamento em blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. Os genótipos CE 08 A.

No HV- 241, a alta eficiência de pastejo (100 % do acúmulo lâmina foliar verde) esteve associada ao baixo acúmulo de lâmina foliar verde (155 kg de MS/ha/ 44 dias). A menor eficiência de pastejo foi observada no Hexaplóide (59 % do acúmulo de lâmina foliar verde), possivelmente em virtude das altas perdas sob pastejo (30 % da massa de lâmina foliar total pré-pastejo). A massa de lâmina foliar verde diminuiu mais acentuadamente até o segundo dia de pastejo, enquanto as perdas de lâmina foliar total foram maiores no 2 º e 3 º dias de pastejo. Os genótipos CE 08 A.

Six replications {{were used to determine}} pre-grazing total leaf blade mass and green and senescent leaf blade mass. Four replications were used for leaf blade accumulation and grazing efficiency and, for these variables, it was used a complete randomized blocks design. The CE 08 A.

The highest grazing efficiency (100 % of the green leaf blade accumulation) occurred at the HV- 241 pastures. This high grazing efficiency was associated to the low green leaf blade accumulation (155 kg of MS/ha/ 44 days).

In this study, we localized and quantifiedinteractions between landscape patterns and agricultural intensification for dairy farming systems in atraditional Dutch rural landscape. First, a conceptual diagram was made that maps causal interactionsbetween landscape patterns and production intensity. This conceptual diagram was converted to spatialexplicit descriptors of landscape patterns, such as hedge density, field size, clay content, ground waterhydrology and spatial explicit descriptors of management such as hedgerow change, field aggregation,field <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> and fertilizer application. Next, these landscape patterns and management descrip-tors were linked to the current production intensity of farms such as total farm milk yield, milk yieldper cow and milk yield per hectare. These descriptors were tested for interrelations by applying two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. We found that a higher milk production was significantly linked tolarger fields, fewer hedgerows, fewer <b>grazing</b> <b>days,</b> higher use of N-fertilizer and a decrease of nutrientcycling. Furthermore, production intensity was found to differ with the landscape pattern of clay con-tent and groundwater hydrology. On top of this landscape template, man-made patterns of field sizesand hedgerows from before 1930 are still visible in the current differences of milk production inten-sity. Current farm management was found to have relations with the hedgerows, field size, clay contentand groundwater hydrology. These relations hint at a co-evolution of landscape pattern and agriculturalintensification. Interestingly, the largest differences between descriptors of landscape pattern and inten-sity were found for similar values of clay content, groundwater hydrology and fertilizer use. We speculatethat these similar values indicate the existence of tipping points for diverging trajectories of intensifica-tion.

During the four-years of measurement, there were initially two or more years at each site of well below average rainfall followed by up to two average rainfall years. There was little or no impact of grazing system on pasture attributes or soil surface condition. Trends in pasture condition and growth were dominated by seasonal conditions, with pastures in all systems responding well to the better rainfall conditions towards the end of the project. Diet quality (measured by NIRS) was generally lower in the more intensive systems, especially during the growing season. There was no consistent difference in <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> per ha due to grazing system. The different grazing systems within a property were not managed independently of each other but tended to be operated as an integrated management system. This meant cattle could spend time within different systems within the one 12 -month period, especially during dry years. In combination with differences in animal classes between systems at some sites, this precluded attempts to directly assess the impact of grazing system on individual animal productivity. The integrated management of paddocks across systems on each property suggests that key management principles, such as matching stocking rate to carrying capacity, were applied to all paddocks on a property to a similar extent. This helps explain lack of impact of grazing system per se and supports the extensive evidence base that indicates stocking rate management, and not grazing system, is the major driver of pasture and animal productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{is to develop a}} desirable system of fattening heifer calves similar to the deferred full-feeding system for steer calves. The system developed for good quality steer calves consists of three phases: (1) producing 225 - 250 pounds of gain during the winter, which usually requires the feeding of four to five pounds of grain per head daily; (2) <b>grazing</b> 90 <b>days</b> without grain; (3) full-feeding 100 days in the dry lot...|$|R
40|$|A code of good {{practices}} {{was established by}} each European member state according to the nitrate directive. In Belgium, the nitrogen (N) inputs from slurry or compost are limited to 230 kg N/ha in pastures. Larger amounts can be applied when a program of additional measurements, including soil nitrates analysis, {{is followed by the}} farmer. This trial aims to measure nitrogen balance and soil nitrates in pastures fertilised with mineral nitrogen fertiliser (min N), pig slurry (S) or cattle compost (C). The pastures were grazed by dairy cows and the fertilisation allowed similar efficient N levels. N inputs by fertilisation were different at 169, 170 and 102 kg N/ha in C, S and min N plots respectively. The use of pig slurry and cattle compost as compared with mineral N fertiliser increased N balance and reduced apparent N efficiency. The nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus nutrition indexes, the number of <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> and the milk yields per ha were not different. The soil nitrate contents were not increased by use of slurry or compost. The overall low nitrate contents suggested a low nitrate leaching with the three types of fertilisation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of decreasing acres available for crop production, an increasing world population, increased utilization of grain for fuel and increased input costs (fuel, transportation, and fertilizer) {{have resulted in}} limited feed supplies and higher feed costs. Additionally, the recent drought {{in much of the}} United States has further reduced the available feed supply driving feed costs dramatically higher. Historically, feed costs have represented 50 D 70 % of the cost of production for beef enterprises. This past year, the high prices for corn and hay have driven that percentage over 80 % for many operations. CowDcalf producers have been forced to investigate alternative feedstuffs to lower the cost of production. Ideally, the cowherd is grazing {{a significant portion of the}} year. <b>Grazing</b> <b>days</b> varies drastically throughout different regions of the United States and is greatly impacted by year to year differences in weather patterns. Drought limits summer grazing. Snow and ice can limit winter grazing. Harvested and stored feeds represent the majority of feed costs for cowDcalf producers. With hay supplies low and hay costs high, producers need to consider alternative feeds for winter feeding and for emergency drought relief...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the animal and herbage productivity of a perennial lupin/cocksfoot pasture mix when compared with a lucerne pure sward positive control in a summer dry environment, at Lincoln University, Canterbury. The lupin/cocksfoot and lucerne pastures were sown on the 5 th of December 2013. Only outcomes from the third growth season (1 July 2015 - 30 June 2016) of the trial are discussed within the current study. The pastures were rotationally grazed by mixed breed ewe hoggets in the early spring-summer (3 September - 11 March) and then swapped out for Coopworth stud ewe lambs in the autumn of 2016 (17 March - 20 May). The lupin/cocksfoot mix produced 50 % as much sheep liveweight as the 1347 kg/ha from lucerne annually. This was due to fewer <b>grazing</b> <b>days,</b> a lower stocking rate and weak evidence of lower average annual daily liveweight gain. Lupin/cocksfoot relative to lucerne, <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> were 75 % of 5101 days, a stocking rate of 74 % of the 20. 2 head /ha, and 66 % of the 264 g of average annual daily liveweight gain that the lucerne provided. The cocksfoot/lupin total annual herbage yield was far lower, the mix provided only 34 % of the 10, 400 kg DM/ha that the lucerne produced. The lupin/cocksfoot had a lower annual average daily herbage dry matter allowance and daily apparent intake. The mix allowed 80 % of the 2. 5 kg dry matter produced by the lucerne pasture per head per day. Of the dry matter produced, the sheep on the mix only grazed 69 % of the 1. 6 kg dry matter that appeared to be grazed by the lucerne pasture per head per day. The higher proportion of pasture legume in the lucerne pasture gave overall higher pasture quality. Crude protein levels were on average 0. 56 lower in the lupin/cocksfoot herbage mix than the 24 % crude protein from the lucerne. The energy content of the pasture was very similar with both pastures having a metabolisable energy content around 10. 6 MJ ME/kg DM. The pre-grazing pasture legume fraction in the lucerne was consistently 90 %, while the lupin/cocksfoot mix had only around 10 - 12 %. The proportion of pasture legume in the mix is the main point of interest and was a driver for both animal liveweight production and herbage production values. This study has shown that when put under a lucerne type grazing regime, perennial lupin in a pasture mix with cocksfoot produces similar outcomes to that of other cocksfoot clover mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Three grazing {{management}} systems, each stocked at 5 wethers/ac (12 S/ha) were compared on dryland lucerne: (i) eight paddock rotation with 5 <b>days</b> <b>grazing</b> per paddock; (ii) four paddock rotation with 12 <b>days</b> <b>grazing</b> per paddock; (iii) set-stocking. All lucerne {{plants in the}} set-stocked area died within seven months. Sheep removed from the treatment at this stage weighed 25. 4 kg while those on the rotational areas weighed 47. 2 kg.

40|$|Wildfires {{can have}} {{significant}} impacts on rangeland productivity and functionality causing substantial economic losses to affected farmers. In August 2011, such wildfires {{swept through the}} North West province of South Africa, destroying large areas of grazing and farm infrastructure. There is little information available on how the regional semi-arid rangelands respond to fire. In order to increase knowledge on short-term regeneration capacities of burned rangelands, the recovery of grass phytomass, composition and diversity {{as well as the}} frequency distribution of patch types (i. e. grass-, litter- and bare patches) were assessed in the growing season following the fire. Burned and unburned sites were compared in two regional grasslands and one savanna type receiving between 480 and 700 mm rainfall y− 1. Fire significantly reduced phytomass production, and lowered the grazing capacity and potential <b>grazing</b> <b>days</b> across vegetation types. In general, grass diversity, composition and relative frequencies remained unaffected documenting an overall good regeneration potential of the grass sward. An increased proportion of bare patches and decrease of litter indicated that the post-fire environment lost functionality with respect to erosion control, nutrient cycling and water infiltration. Gained insights provide valuable baseline information for future impact assessments and research into the fire dynamics of investigated vegetation types. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Grazing warm-season grass {{pastures}} with stocker cattle (Bos taurus) is {{an important}} economic activity in the southern Great Plains, and substantial increases {{in the price of}} N fertilizer have negatively affected profi tability of forage producers. The goal {{of the study was to}} determine if bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. ] pastures interseeded with either annual or perennial legumes are more profitable than the conventional method of fertilizing with 112 kg N ha– 1 commercial fertilizer. A completely randomized design grazing study was conducted in south-central Oklahoma during the spring and summer months of 2008, 2009, and 2010. Preconditioned stocker cattle (260 ± 47 kg head– 1) were randomly assigned to pastures (1. 42 ± 0. 10 ha; three replicates per system) at 2. 32 ± 0. 40 animals ha– 1, beginning when measured standing forage reached 2000 kg ha– 1 and grazing continuously until forage mass declined to 1000 kg ha– 1. Results of the 3 -yr grazing study show that under continuous stocking for the growing conditions common to the south-central Great Plains, the legume systems could not compete economically with the common practice of fertilizing bermudagrass pastures with synthetic inorganic N fertilizer. Results are most sensitive to number of <b>grazing</b> <b>days,</b> price of N, and prices of legume seed...|$|R
