25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is similar in}} basic concept to a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> {{consisting}} of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The Blake crusher was {{patented}} by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> has a fixed feed {{area and a}} variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.|$|E
25|$|A crusher bucket is an {{attachment}} for hydraulic excavators. Its {{way of working}} consists on a bucket with two crushing jaws inside, {{one of them is}} fixed and the other one moves back and forth relative to it, as in a <b>Jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b>|$|E
40|$|The rollerjaw rock crusher melds the {{concepts}} of <b>jaw</b> <b>crushing</b> and roll crushing long employed in the mining and rock-crushing industries. Rollerjaw rock crushers have been proposed for inclusion in geological exploration missions on Mars, {{where they would be}} used to pulverize rock samples into powders in the tens of micrometer particle size range required for analysis by scientific instruments...|$|R

25|$|Acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome (set {{of signs}} and symptoms) due to decreased blood {{flow in the}} coronary arteries such {{that part of the}} heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the <b>jaw,</b> <b>crushing,</b> central and associated with nausea and sweating. Acute coronary syndrome is usually caused by one of three problems: ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%).|$|R
25|$|In the Dodge type jaw crushers, {{the jaws}} are farther {{apart at the}} top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the {{material}} is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it is small enough {{to escape from the}} bottom opening. The Dodge <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.|$|E
25|$|Symons {{cone crusher}} (spring cone crusher) can crush {{materials}} of above medium hardness. And {{it is widely}} used in metallurgy, building, hydropower, transportation, chemical industry, etc. When used with <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> {{it can be used}} as secondary, tertiary or quaternary crushing. Generally speaking, the standard type of Symons cone crusher is applied to medium crushing. The medium type is applied to fine crushing. The short head type is applied to coarse fine crushing. As casting steel technique is adopted, the machine has good rigidity and large high strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{ore body}} is {{approximately}} 15km long {{and up to}} 3km wide, comprising the hills {{to the south of}} the Boolgeeda Creek Valley. Mining incorporates a fleet of fifteen Komatsu 830E haul trucks. The ore is processed on site in the plant to produce lump (<31.5mm, >6mm) and fines (<6mm) product. There is a primary <b>Jaw</b> <b>Crusher,</b> two secondary cone crushers, a six bin screening building and a 1.2 Million tonne capacity stockyard. Stockpiled ore is loaded onto rail and then transported to the coast through the Hamersley & Robe River railway, where it is loaded onto ships.|$|E

25|$|In {{the single}} toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is {{suspended}} on the eccentric shaft {{which leads to}} a much more compact design than that of the double toggle <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher.</b> The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.|$|E
25|$|When the Lucy Tongue Level was {{completed}} in 1869, its entrance was below the ore hoppers {{at the foot of}} the incline from the Low Horse Level. A water-powered incline was built to take the ore up to those hoppers, though this involved a considerable amount of reorganisation in the area. Labour shortages in 1870 led to further mechanisation of the labour-intensive ore washing. A new oscillating <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> eliminated the need for initial hand-knocking of the ore, and was powered by a high-pressure water turbine. Hotching tubs, even when mechanised, still needed constant supervision, and were replaced by newly-available automated fixed-sieve jigging machines. These still involved forcing water up and down through the bed of ore, but the sieves, covered with a three-inch (76mm) layer of galena, were stationary; material of the same density passed through the bed but lighter material was washed into the next sieve down the line. They were very effective and enabled a complete separation of galena and gangue.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{the work}} hardening behaviour and microstructure of austenitic manganese steel relative to premature failure of <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws.</b> Samples of sound and failed <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws</b> were taken, the change with depth from the working surface to the sample core was measured and their microstructures observed. The study revealed a sharp hardness gradient in the failed <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws,</b> and presence of large carbides at both the austenite grain boundaries and in the austenite matrix. The failure of <b>crusher</b> <b>jaws</b> was attributed to brittle fracture {{as a result of}} precipitates of carbides from the inability of precipitated carbides to absorb shock during impact working. Finally, we conclude that the failure occurred as a result of inadequate quenching operations during the manufacturing process that resulted in the formation of carbide precipitates which embrittle the austenitic manganese steel, reduce its ability to withstand shock and create a non uniform plastic flow as it is work hardening...|$|R

5000|$|Panther {{chameleons}} {{have very}} long tongues (sometimes longer {{than their own}} body length) which {{they are capable of}} rapidly extending out of the mouth. The tongue extends at around 26 body lengths per second. The tongue hits the prey in about 0.0030 sec. The tongue of the chameleon is a complex arrangement of bone, muscle and sinew. At the base of the tongue, a bone is shot forward, giving the tongue the initial momentum it needs to reach the prey quickly. At the tip of this elastic tongue, a muscular, club-like structure covered in thick mucus forms a suction cup. [...] Once the tip sticks to a prey item, it is drawn quickly back into the mouth, where the panther chameleon's strong <b>jaws</b> <b>crush</b> it and it is consumed.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> uses {{compressive}} force for breaking of particle. [...] This mechanical pressure {{is achieved by}} the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists {{of a set of}} vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hill was}} quarried for {{millstone}} grit from the 16th century until 1955. There were two quarries, {{one by the}} northern viewpoint at Windyway producing a blue stone, and the other near the Tegg's Nose summit producing Tegg's Nose Pink. Quarrying was originally by hand, giving a high-quality product used for buildings, gravestones, kerbs, flagstones and cobbles, which was used as far afield as the Isle of Man. Blasting {{was introduced in the}} 1930s, producing crushed stone for roads and airfields, and during the Second World War, rock for runways was extracted using pneumatic drills. A collection of historical quarrying equipment is preserved within the Country Park, including a <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher,</b> crane and a stone saw, which was powered by a steam engine. There is evidence of a railway track around the disused summit quarry. There is also evidence of a bomb crater at the bottom of Teggsnose caused by a German bomber during WW2 which {{can be seen from the}} summit ...|$|E
2500|$|The Temagami Mining and Milling Company {{operated}} a concentrating plant and worked two shafts, one open cut and one adit from 1905 to 1908. A former railway siding, known as Grey's siding, {{was used to}} ship ore away from the mine site. The shipped ore averaged [...] of gold per ton. Analysis of drill core data ranged from trace to [...] of gold per ton and from trace to [...] of silver per ton. Ore was hoisted by skip then dumped into a Blake <b>jaw</b> <b>crusher</b> at the concentrating plant. It was then dried, passed through roll crushers and elevated to trommels for sizing. The oversized ore passed down through a fine roll crusher. After the reduced ore fragments passed through roll crushers, it was then put through three Kriem air separators in the mill. The ore concentrates from these separators were drawn off and bagged for shipping. A [...] long and [...] wide arsenic vein was also mined during this period. All of the mining infrastructure was subsequently destroyed by a forest fire and operations were not renewed. There are no data available on how much the mine produced. Since the closure of Big Dan, the adit and shafts have been flooded. Remains of the former concentrating plant are also present.|$|E
50|$|Terrapins {{are strong}} swimmers. They have {{strongly}} webbed hind feet, but not flippers as do sea turtles. Like their relatives (Graptemys), they have strong <b>jaws</b> for <b>crushing</b> shells of prey, such as clams and snails.

25|$|Nowadays {{there are}} some crusher buckets with a {{patented}} technology which can achieve a higher productivity (Xcentric Crusher). They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an antiestagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from getting stuck in the bucket's mouth, not allowing them to enter the <b>crushing</b> <b>jaws.</b> They have also the <b>crushing</b> <b>jaws</b> placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} physical, {{chemical}} and mineralogical characteristics of fine recycled aggregates obtained from crushed concrete waste, comparing them with {{two types of}} natural fine aggregates from different origins. A commercial concrete was <b>jaw</b> <b>crushed,</b> {{and the effect of}} different aperture sizes on the particle size distribution of the resulting aggregates was evaluated. The density and water absorption of the recycled aggregates was determined and a model for predicting water absorption over time is proposed. Both natural and recycled aggregates were characterized regarding bulk density and fines content. Recycled aggregates were additionally characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS and DTA/TG of individual size fractions. The results show that natural and recycled fine aggregates have very different characteristics. This should be considered in potential applications, both in terms of the limits for replacing amounts and of the rules and design criteria of the manufactured products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The grey {{triggerfish}} is a demersal species and feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates such as shrimps, crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, sand dollars, starfish and sea cucumbers. It has strong teeth specialised for making holes in hard-shelled prey. An interesting feeding behaviour has been observed, {{in which the}} fish positions itself vertically above a sandy seabed and puffs a stream of water out of its mouth. This disturbs the substrate and may reveal something edible. Further puffs expose more, and the prey item is gripped with the fish's sharp teeth and removed from the seabed. If it is a sand dollar, the fish drops it and picks it up again several times until the prey lands upside down. The fish then adopts its vertical stance once more and attacks the middle with closed <b>jaws,</b> <b>crushing</b> the soft central area. It then scoops out and devours the flesh.|$|R

50|$|The local Communist {{resistance}} {{groups of}} the Front National (FN) were hostile to Rassinier's idea of non-violent resistance and were enraged when Rassinier published leaflets condemning Soviet Communism equally with the National Socialism of Hitler. After several warnings, the Communists condemned him to death. Rassinier's life was saved when in reaction to attacks on Germans at a local pharmacy and coffee house, both German and Vichy French police launched a series of raids that led to several arrests, {{one of them a}} person with a forged identity card. He broke under interrogation and revealed how he had obtained it, and on 30 October 1943 Rassinier was arrested in his classroom by agents of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), his arrest observed by a Liberation-North agent who was delivering forged identity and ration cards to him. His wife and two-year-old son were also arrested, but released a few days later. For eleven days, Rassinier was interrogated, the beatings involved leading to a broken <b>jaw,</b> <b>crushed</b> hand and ruptured kidney.|$|R

At the Battle of Wauhatchie, during a surprise night attack by the Confederate forces, Greene was wounded in the face, with his <b>jaw</b> <b>crushed</b> and some teeth carried away. Subsequent surgery was not able to correct his condition and he suffered from the effects of his wound {{for the rest of his}} life. After six weeks of medical leave, he was assigned to light court-martial duty until January 1865, when he was sent to join Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's army in North Carolina. Initially Greene voluntarily served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Jacob D. Cox participating in the battle at Kinston, where he had his horse shot out from under him. At the very end of the war Greene was in command of the 3rd Brigade in Absalom Baird's 3rd Division, XIV Corps, and participated in the capture of Raleigh and the pursuit of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's army until its surrender.|$|R
