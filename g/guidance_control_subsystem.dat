40|$|The NASA Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) {{program is}} {{developing}} a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for ground measurements. A key element {{for the success of}} this program is a Platform Precision Autopilot (PPA). An interim vehicle (NASA C- 20 AJGlll) was selected to carry the radar pod and develop the PPA. The PPA interfaces with the C- 20 AIG Ill aircraft by imitating the output of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. This technique retains the safeguards in the aircraft's autopilot. The PPA entered initial flight testing in early 2007. The PPA uses a Kalman filter to generate a real-time position solution with information from the C- 20 AIGIII and a real-time differential GPS unit designed by JPL.

40|$|To date, the {{subsystems}} of spacecraft {{are often}} still interconnected with application-specific pointto- point links, for example using UART protocols. A more versatile interconnect would allow components {{to be changed}} more easily without much impacting the overall system, driving down system cost by increasing flexibility during development and creating new opportunities for reusing components across different space missions. Ubiquitous, high-speed Ethernet hardware may offer a cost-effective solution. TTEthernet {{is one of a}} handful of recent approaches for adding real-time and fault-tolerance capabilities to the Ethernet protocol. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) is currently evaluating the option of using TTEthernet for its upcoming SHEFEX III re-entry mission. Time-critical navigation solution messages have to be transmitted from the vehicle’s navigation system to the <b>guidance</b> and <b>control</b> <b>subsystem,</b> which <b>controls</b> the spacecraft’s actuators to keep the desired trajectory and orientation.

This thesis evaluates several possible designs and proposes a solution based on the development of a dedicated RS- 422 to TTEthernet gateway.

SVGS enables proximity operations and formation flying capabilities for small satellite platforms.

The resulting image is then processed using a modification of algorithms originally developed at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center for the Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS), which successfully flew on the Demonstration for Autonomous Rendezvous Technology (DART) and Orbital Express missions. These algorithms use simple geometric photogrammetry techniques to determine the six-degree of freedom state of one spacecraft relative to the other.

Furthermore, the linear and rotational dynamics based on the magnetic tensor theory are explained in order to model the chaser–target interactions. In addition, the set of three-dimensional nonlinear dynamical equations that model the detumbling process are formulated including a specific control strategy, with possible inaccuracies and delays derived from the onboard sensors and actuators. Moreover, a stability analysis is developed in the vicinity of a stable asymptotic state for a simplified two-dimensional configuration where an analytical approach is viable.

The vehicle, as well as its <b>guidance</b> and <b>control</b> systems, must be rugged enough to withstand battle conditions, rough terrain, hostile weather conditions, and the impact of dummy shells on its superstructure. The vehicle's steering and speed control are accomplished remotely by signals sent via a guide wire laid on the ground. The Army Wire-Following-Vehicle (WFV) represents new technology in the area of automatic vehicle guidance and has a host of potential applications, both military (such as a target drone) and civilian (such as underground mining and rescue as well as surface mass transit on electronic guide ways).
