After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts, and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.|$|E

25|$|Johnny Carson's {{success on}} ABC's Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> led NBC to {{invite him to}} take over Tonight {{a few months before}} Paar's departure. Carson {{declined}} the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes daily. Bob Newhart, Jackie Gleason, Groucho Marx, and Joey Bishop all also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job {{for the first time on}} the February 11, 1962, episode of What's My Line?. Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over. Guest hosts included Merv Griffin, Art Linkletter, Joey Bishop, Arlene Francis (the first woman to host The Tonight Show), Bob Cummings, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx, Donald O'Connor, and others.|$|E

2500|$|Carson hosted several shows besides Carson's Cellar, {{including}} the game show Earn Your Vacation (1954) and the CBS variety show The Johnny Carson Show (1955–1956). He {{was a guest}} panelist on the original To Tell the Truth starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time The Johnny Carson Show failed, he moved to New York City to host Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> (1957–1962), formerly known as <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust</b> Your Wife?. In 1958, he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled [...] "Do You Trust Your Wife" [...] on NBC's short-lived variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. On Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?,</b> Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although he believed moving to daytime would hurt his career, Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became [...] "the hottest item on daytime television" [...] during his five years at ABC.|$|E

2500|$|McMahon {{followed}} Carson from Who <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Trust?</b> as his announcer and sidekick and Skitch Henderson {{was installed}} as the maestro of the NBC orchestra. McMahon's famous introduction, [...] "Heeeeere's Johnny!!!" [...] {{was followed by}} a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews, and music. Carson's trademark was a phantom golf swing {{at the end of his}} monologues, aimed stage left toward the studio orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. Bob Newhart rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.) ...|$|E

Other presenting jobs in the 1960s included hosting Candid Camera and compèring Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Around 1969 he was a partner, with Malcolm Mitchell, in the Mitchell Monkhouse Agency. In 1979 he starred in a US sketch comedy television series called Bonkers! with the Hudson Brothers and Joan Rivers, a job he hated.

For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced The Tonight Show with a drawn-out [...] "Heeere's Johnny!" [...] His booming voice and constant laughter alongside the [...] "King of Late Night" [...] earned McMahon the nickname the [...] "Human Laugh Track" [...] and [...] "Toymaker to the King".
