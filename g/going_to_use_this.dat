500|$|To record Taylor Swift, she had {{to choose}} which album {{producer}} she would work with: [...] "Then, all of a sudden, it was, 'OK, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> producer' or 'We're {{going to use that}} producer.'" [...] After experimenting with different producers, originating from Nashville, Swift chose Chapman because of the unique sound he put into songs. Big Machine Records was skeptical about hiring Chapman because he had never done a studio album prior to Taylor Swift, only demos. Swift described the songs he produced as [...] "the right chemistry hit" [...] and therefore, Big Machine Records accepted Chapman producing some of the album's songs. In the end, Chapman produced {{all but one of the}} tracks on Taylor Swift. Recording was executed during a four-month period before 2005 was over.|$|E

50|$|Everyone at Marvel {{remained}} tight-lipped as to {{the meaning}} of the title, with many fans speculating that it meant Marvel was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> event to officially kill off the X-Men and replace them with the Inhumans due to rumors of movie rights disputes between Disney's Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox (who own the film rights to the X-Men). This theory became even more popular due to the increased popularity for The Inhumans after many Inhuman characters were introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and on Marvel's lineup of animated shows which include Ultimate Spider-Man, Avengers Assemble (where they were a prominent part of the show's adaptation of Civil War), Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., and Guardians of the Galaxy as well as the fact Marvel increased their Inhuman presence in their comics ever since the Infinity and Inhumanity story arcs.|$|E

Fellow Brooklynite Gershwin's 1924 composition entitled [...] "Rhapsody in Blue", also the opening song of the film, does seem perfectly apt for the film, as the idea for the song came to Gershwin on a train journey to Boston. Gershwin describes as [...] "a musical kaleidoscope of America, of our vast melting pot, our unduplicated national pep, our blues, our metropolitan madness." [...] It's that Metropolitan Madness that makes it work so well in Woody Allen's Manhattan. Used in the extended opening homage, it is the perfect soundtrack to New York at all hours.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the Potts model with q colors on {{a sequence of}} weighted graphs with adjacency matrices A_n, allowing for {{both positive and negative}} weights. Under a mild regularity condition the mean-field prediction for the log partition function of the Potts model on a sequence of matrices A_n is asymptotically correct, whenever tr(A_n^ 2) =o(n). In particular, our results are applicable for the Ising and the Potts models on any sequence of graphs with average degree <b>going</b> <b>to</b> +∞. <b>Using</b> <b>this,</b> we establish the universality of the limiting log partition function of the ferromagnetic Potts model for a sequence of asymptotically regular graphs, and that of the Ising model for bi-regular bipartite graphs in both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic domain. We also derive a large deviation principle for the empirical measure of the colors for the Potts model on asymptotically regular graphs. Comment: 35 pages, minor chages, to appear in PTR...|$|R

40|$|A clutch {{is a very}} {{important}} machine element which plays a main role in the transmission of power from one component to another. A common and well known application for the clutch is in automotive vehicles where it is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> connect the engine and the gearbox. As the clutch is working condition it undergoes the affect of friction force and heating of surface and as a result wear takes place, which reduces the life of clutch. Wear is a process of gradual removal of a material from surfaces of solids subject to contact and sliding. Damages of contact surfaces are results of wear. The objective is to calculate the coefficient of friction and total wear with respect to the variable (time, load and velocity) by the help of pin on Disc method to evaluate the property of the materials for the comparative study of them. To select the best material from the materials <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in <b>this</b> test or enhance the properties of them to increase the life of clutch. KEYWORDS:.
