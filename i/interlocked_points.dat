50|$|On 6 December 1870, a {{collision}} between two trains at Brockley Whins, County Durham killed five people. The accident {{was caused by}} a lack of <b>interlocking</b> between <b>points</b> and signals.|$|R
25|$|Originally, {{the early}} {{railways}} employed policemen {{to time the}} intervals between trains and to give a 'stop' signal if a train had passed in the previous ten minutes. Developments led to many everyday workings (such as <b>interlocking</b> <b>points)</b> and signal boxes to house the levers that allowed signallers to change the points and signals over a given stretch of railway. These signalboxes were often elevated above the railway due to the locking mechanisms of the signals and points being accommodated on the lower storey. This also allowed the signaller {{to keep an eye}} on things from a good vantage point.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{accidents}} {{took place}} on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) during the early 1850s due to signalling failures. Saxby became interested in railway safety and invented an improved signalling lamp, giving considerable benefits and savings on the lamps then in use. He also invented a device for <b>interlocking</b> <b>points</b> and signals. In 1856 he was awarded a patent for this invention which was designed to act at once upon all the points and signals at a railway junction. Not only were the points and signals activated, but all the other signals in the system were locked against improper use.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{rarely used}} by modern {{conventional}} military units, abatises are still officially maintained in United States Army and Marine Corps training. Current US training instructs engineers or other constructors of such obstacles to fell trees, leaving a [...] stump, {{in such a}} manner as the trees fall <b>interlocked</b> <b>pointing</b> at a 45-degree angle towards the direction of approach of the enemy. Furthermore, it is recommended that the trees remain connected to the stumps and the length of roadway covered be at least [...] US military maps record an abatis by use of an inverted [...] "V" [...] with a short line extending from it to the right.|$|R
50|$|On 29 June 1867, a {{passenger}} train {{ran into the}} rear of a coal train at Warrington, Cheshire due to a pointsmans error which was compounded {{by the lack of}} <b>interlocking</b> between <b>points</b> and signals. Eight people were killed and 33 were injured.|$|R
50|$|To {{cope with}} {{increasing}} traffic, <b>interlocked</b> signals and <b>points</b> were installed in 1875, and the Port line was upgraded to double track in 1881.|$|R
40|$|Passage {{consists}} of six main sections, a prelude and postlude. Each section is unified through the continual variation of one main motive {{as well as}} the chord progression from which the motive is derived. The head of the motive {{consists of}} the notes G Ab Eb which are varied through different transpositions and combinations. Invariably this one motive is capable of creating the different moods specified by the text through the orchestral variations of timbre and the imposition of rhythmic variations. The underpinning chord progression from which the motive is derived is based on a polychord. This polychord consists of the two chords (major and minor). However, almost every appearance of the progression is presented with the two chords intersecting to form a minor second as an <b>interlocking</b> <b>point.</b> All of these elements are thus realized throughout the work through the use of ethereal textures and spacious orchestrations...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{well known that}} Major-General J. F. C. Fuller was a strong critic of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's grand strategy and strategic decision-making during the Second World War. Historian's of Fuller's life, military theories and historical writing have offered, however, few explanations as {{to the nature of}} this critique, when it first emerged and what the motivations were which underpinned it. There has been little attempt to investigate just how well Fuller knew Churchill, either, or the extent to which this knowledge informed his historical writing. This article seeks to correct {{one or two of the}} general explanations which have been given, arguing that Fuller's questioning of Churchill's wartime leadership was based on a number of <b>interlocking</b> <b>points</b> of criticism, his personal knowledge of the Prime Minister and that it represented the first sustained literary attack on his performance as a strategist during six years of total war...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Control {{systems are}} {{required}} to comply with certain safety and liveness correctness properties. In most cases, such systems have an intrinsic degree of complexity {{and it is not}} easy to formally analyze them, due to the resulting large state space. Also, exhaustive simulation and testing can easily miss system errors, whether they are life-critical or not. In this work, we introduce an interlocking control approach that is based on the use of the so-called Distributed Signal Boxes (DSBs). The proposed control design is applied to a railwayinterlocking problem and more precisely, to the Athens underground metro system. Signal boxes correspond to the network’s <b>interlocking</b> <b>points</b> and communicate only with their neighbor signal boxes. Communication takes place by the use of rendezvous communication channels. This design results in a simple interlocking control approach that compared to other centralized solutions produces a smaller and easier to analyze state space. Formal analysis and verification is performed with the SPIN model checker...|$|R
50|$|William Robert Sykes (1840-1917) was a British {{engineer}} from London, {{known for}} his work in railway signalling and other safety devices. He is noted for the invention of the Sykes ‘Lock and block’ <b>interlocking</b> system of <b>points</b> and signals.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the railways, signalmen were {{responsible}} for ensuring any points (US: switches) were set correctly before allowing a train to proceed. Mistakes, however, led to accidents, sometimes with fatalities. The concept of the <b>interlocking</b> of <b>points,</b> signals and other appliances was introduced to improve safety. This prevents a signalman from operating appliances in an unsafe sequence, such as clearing a signal while one or more sets of points are not set correctly for the route.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens. The first good specimen, the former holotype (specimen {{on which a}} taxonomic name is based) of Anatosaurus copei (Anatotitan), was a {{complete}} skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill for American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. This specimen, found in Hell Creek Formation rocks, came from northeast of the Black Hills of South Dakota and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis {{and part of the}} torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a horny sheath with a tooth-like series of <b>interlocking</b> <b>points</b> on the upper and lower jaws. When describing this specimen AMNH5730, Cope assigned it to the species Diclonius mirabilis. This species name was created by combining Diclonius, a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with Trachodon mirabilis, an older name based on teeth and published by Joseph Leidy. Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus. Leidy had come to recognize that his Trachodon was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and though he had made some attempts to revise the genus, he had not yet made any formal declaration of his intentions.|$|R
5000|$|Income {{slightly}} {{improved in}} this time, and some {{work was done}} on relaying the track with recovered materials from the disused Llangurig spur line. In 1888 there was a surplus on operating account of £5,750, {{but all of the}} [...] "profit" [...] was eaten up immediately by backlogs of rent and interest charges; the backlog continued to increase. However in 1889 the Regulation of Railways Act was passed, requiring the installation of block signalling <b>interlocking</b> of <b>points</b> and signals, and continuous brakes on passenger trains; all of this would cost money that the M&MR did not have.|$|R
50|$|In 1869 {{the only}} {{parts of the}} line to have block {{signalling}} were the junctions at Seamer and Beverley, and at the two termini. In the early 1870s, following serious accidents due to human error in setting points, the NER began to introduce <b>point</b> <b>interlocking</b> on all its lines. The work on the Hull-Scarborough line was completed by 1875.|$|R

50|$|Despite the station's size {{there was}} never a signal box. At the end of the {{platform}} was the only signal, a single crossbar stop signal topped by a lamp.

2500|$|In the meantime, {{the lack}} of food and {{supplies}} and a general Indian blockade on the settlement's ability to hunt, forage, and claim farmland into the interior, combined {{with the arrival of}} additional colonists, weak leadership, and several other factors to cause death of over 80% of the 500 colonists at Jamestown in the subsequent year. This period between the fall of 1609 and the spring of 1610, became known as [...] "starving time", and indelibly shaped the community into the remainder of the 17th century as it strove to become more self-sufficient, chose a mixed use of crop, and caused the survivors and subsequent colonists to seek <b>interlocking</b> strategic <b>points</b> along the coasts to control Chesapeake Bay.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} signal boxes in England {{are on the}} Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. Signal boxes house the {{signalman}} and equipment that control the railway points and signals. Originally railway signals were controlled from a hut on a platform at junctions. In the 1850s a raised building with a glazed upper storey containing levers controlling points and signals was developed after John Saxby obtained a patent in 1856 for a mechanical system of <b>interlocking</b> the <b>points</b> and signals. Over half of the signalboxes before 1923 were built by private signalling contractors, the largest being Saxby & Farmer; Stevens & Sons, McKenzie & Holland, the Railway Signal Co., Dutton & Co and Evans, O’Donnell & Co were others. Some railway companies had a standard signalbox design, such as the London & North Western Railway, whereas others, such as the Great Eastern Railway had many different designs.|$|R
25|$|The LB {{was using}} {{primitive}} interlocking between signals at some junctions by 1844. In 1856, John Saxby, an LB carpenter, patented {{a form of}} manual <b>interlocking</b> of the <b>points</b> and signals, first tried at Bricklayers' Arms that year. The first fully interlocking frame was installed by Saxby at Keymer Junction near Haywards Heath in 1860, where he built a small workshop to undertake private work. He left the company and in 1862 formed Saxby & Farmer signalling contractors. Thereafter the LB patronised Saxby & Farmer {{for most of its}} signalling until circa 1880.|$|R
