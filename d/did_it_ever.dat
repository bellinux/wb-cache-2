Originally {{the station was}} served by eighteen northbound and fifteen southbound trains per day. Patronage grew rapidly from the 1970s, as a large-scale residential development project commenced in 1967. Ticket sales were introduced in 1991, but terminated shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Büchsel {{carefully}} {{noted that}} a condition {{for success in the}} German invasion of America was the absence of a major conflict in Europe. Another condition was a poor state of American preparedness. Both of these conditions were eroding at the time of Büchsel's authorship of the third plan. The US had been aroused, filled with a new martial spirit after its victory over Spain in 1898. America had immediately begun building battleships, and the balance of sea power was shifting away from the German advantage reported by von Diederichs. The British Royal Navy, the strongest navy in the world, was expanding further, and other countries were planning very heavy dreadnought-type battleships. This put extra pressure on the German Navy which never reached a position of parity with the United Kingdom, nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> expand enough to satisfy the warship and troopship numbers specified by von Mantey and then by Büchsel in the various US invasion plans. The Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903 showed the world that the US was willing to use its naval strength to force an American viewpoint in world politics; the crisis established President Theodore Roosevelt's Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, setting a precedent for US intervention in South American–European affairs. In April 1904, the balance of power was seriously shifted in Europe with the signing of the Entente Cordiale by Britain and France. This improved diplomatic relationship between the two countries allowed French and British military forces to be shifted elsewhere, usually to the detriment of Wilhelm II's hope for a Kolonialreich—an empire of German influence much like the British Empire and the French colonial empire. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia refused to form a military alliance with Germany so the Kaiser determined that he should focus on strengthening Germany for a possible European conflict rather than an overseas invasion. The US invasion plans were shelved in 1906.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the first}} direct ideological successors of Sămănătorul was Iorga's own Democratic Nationalist Party. According to Veiga: [...] "In this new phase, Iorga did not resort to very {{different}} arguments, but merely sought to render a more politically explicit expression to the literary aesthetics of Sămănătorul." [...] In Stanomir's account, the [...] "avatars" [...] {{represented by the}} Democratic Nationalist program and Neamul Românesc are, like Sămănătorul, episodes in a [...] "series marked by the recovery and valorization of the Eminescian assets". Despite its intention of addressing the peasantry, Sămănătorul {{is thought to have}} mostly appealed to white-collar workers. Călinescu, who contrasted its approach with the elitism and professionalization advocated by Junimea, concluded: [...] " [...] primarily gathered writers of little culture, officers, young men who did not complete their education [...] autodidacts [...] The magazine made itself well liked by schoolteachers, provincial professors, Romanians outside the borders, and, in spreading throughout these environments, it educated the masses in view of accepting proper literature. It is true that the very same readers were left with horror for all things 'alien', 'unhealthy', but when <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> happen that the multitudes reach a level required for the understanding of more refined art? One could say that Semănătorul and all the other like-minded publications assumed the thankless mission of promoting Junimist ideas all around, while renouncing the [...] at the risk of compromising themselves in front of literary historians less sympathetic to a magazine's goals." [...] Sandqvist also notes that the main group to be attracted by traditionalism, particularly after the 1907 revolt, mostly comprised [...] "underpaid classicists, historians, and lawyers who composed the nation's overstaffed bureaucracy".|$|E
