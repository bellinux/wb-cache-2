Animals that lived in the sediment made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers. Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> 8.3% of species.|$|E

5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

Less common were the genera Baetis and Ephemerella (9 individuals each), Acroneuria (6 individuals), Cheumatopsyche and Rhyacophila (4 individuals each), and Simulium (3 individuals).

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the <b>individuals</b> <b>and</b> their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

40|$|When {{working as}} a member of a team, {{individuals}} must make decisions concerning the allocation of resources (e. g., effort) toward <b>individual</b> goals <b>and</b> team goals. As a result, <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team goals, and feedback related to progress toward these goals, should be potent levers for affecting resource allocation decisions. This research develops a multilevel, multiple-goal model of <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team regulatory processes that affect the allocation of resources across <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team goals resulting in <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team performance. On the basis of this model, predictions concerning the impact of <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team performance feedback are examined empirically to evaluate the model and to understand the influence of feedback on regulatory processes and resource allocation. Two hundred thirty-seven participants were randomly formed into 79 teams of 3 that performed a simulated radar task that required teamwork. Results support the model and the predicted role of feedback in affecting the allocation of resources when individuals strive to accomplish both <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team goals. One of the hallmarks of the changing nature of work is the increasing shift to the use of teams as the basic organizing unit. This shift has implications for training that is designed to enhance both <b>individual</b> <b>and</b> team performance. Although a number of tea...|$|R
