5|$|This pumping {{project was}} {{designed}} to increase the surface area of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake, and thus increase the rate of water evaporation. The pumps drove some of {{the water of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake into the 320,000-acre (1300-square kilometer) Newfoundland Evaporation Basin in the desert west of the lake. A weir in the dike {{at the southern end of}} the Newfoundland Mountains regulated the level of water in the basin, and it sometimes returned salty water from the evaporation basin into the main body of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.|$|E

5|$|Whales in the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake: Local legend {{maintains}} that in 1875, entrepreneur James Wickham had two whales {{released into the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake, {{with the intent of}} using them as a tourist attraction.

5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake is fed {{by three}} major rivers and several minor streams. The three major rivers are each fed {{directly}} or indirectly from the Uinta Mountain range in northeastern Utah. The Bear River starts on the north slope of the Uintas and flows north past Bear Lake, into which some of Bear River's waters have been diverted via a man-made canal into the lake, but later empty back into the river {{by means of the}} Bear Lake Outlet. The river then turns south in southern Idaho and eventually flows into the northeast arm of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake. The Weber River also starts on the north slope of the Uinta Mountains and flows into the east edge of the lake. The Jordan River does not receive its water directly from the Uintas, rather it flows from freshwater Utah Lake, which itself is fed primarily by the Provo River; the Provo River does originate in the Uintas, {{a few miles from the}} Weber and Bear. The Jordan flows from the north part of Utah Lake into the southeast corner of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.|$|E
5|$|While waterspouts form {{mostly in}} the tropics and {{subtropical}} areas, other areas also report waterspouts, including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes, Antarctica and on rare occasions, the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake.

5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed {{the southern part of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E

5|$|Located {{entirely in}} Salt Lake County, Utah, SR-202 begins at an {{intersection}} with SR-201 and 11500West northwest of Magna, Utah. The road travels northwesterly, bordered {{on the east}} by a large tailing pond owned by Kennecott Utah Copper {{and part of the}} former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad rail line, which is now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad (UP). The parallel rail line intersects a pair of east–west rail lines, the southern line being UP main line, and the northern line being the Feather River Route of the former Western Pacific Railroad, which is now owned by UP. After crossing the rail lines, SR-202 intersects with I-80 near the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake State Park and comes to a terminus at the I-80 frontage road, which provides access to the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake State Park and to the Saltair resort. Kennecott Utah Copper owns all of the land surrounding SR-202, except for the right-of-way for the railroad, and the highway itself.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake entered written European history {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, {{and it was not}} shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River {{watershed}} is {{bounded by}} several other major North American watersheds, which drain {{both to the}} Atlantic or the Pacific, or into endorheic basins. On the southwest side a divide separates the Snake watershed from Oregon's Harney Basin, which is endorheic. On the south, the Snake watershed borders that of the Humboldt River in Nevada, and the watershed of the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake (the Bear, Jordan and Weber rivers) on the south.|$|E

5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad line, {{part of the}} Feather River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway with rock and gravel at a great cost. Along the route across the <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert, the railroad served the communities of Arinosa, Barro, and Salduro, which were also served by the new road. The Union Pacific Railroad merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Pacific in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|The journey west usually took {{between four}} and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed by {{following}} a new route called Hastings Cutoff, which crossed Utah's Wasatch Mountains and <b>Great</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Desert.

5|$|All {{but four}} of the streams lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river itself does not flow through Idaho.
