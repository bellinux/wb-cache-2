40|$|This thesis reports an {{experimental}} and theoretical study on filtration properties of water based drilling fluids under dynamic and static conditions. The tested muds cover Freshwater/Gypsum/Lignosulphonate mud and SeawaterlKCLlPolymer mud, bariteweighted and unweighted. The {{effects of the}} solid concentration, pressure and shear rate on the filter cake characteristics and the erodability were investigated. For static filtration experiments, all tests were conducted for two hours and the spurt loss, the filter cake thickness, the ratio of wet to <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> <b>mass</b> and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured. For dynamic filtration experiments, however, only the spurt loss and the cumulative filtrate volume against time were measured and all tests were conducted for at least 8 hours. A general filtration equation was developed based on the cake filtration theory prevailing in the chemical engineering industry and it was utilised to obtain the modified classic static filtration equation and the dynamic filtration equation. The modified classic static filtration equation was then employed to fit the static filtration experimental data and the average specific static cake resistance and the effective filter medium resistance were calculated. The dynamic filtration equation showed a substantial agreement with the dynamic filtration experimental data. Using the static filter cake properties such as the ratio of wet to <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> <b>mass</b> (m), the average specific dynamic cake resistance, the effective filter medium resistance and the dynamic filter cake erodability were calculated. In {{the study of the}} relationship between the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data, an attempt of predicting the dynamic filtration data from the static filtration experimental data was conducted. Also, an attempt was carried out to predict the static filtration data and the dynamic filtration data in a sequential process. The experimental data suggests that a substantial difference exists between the specific resistances of static and dynamic filter cakes. No apparent distinction was found, however, between spurt loss and effective filter medium resistance. The reodability of dynamically deposited mud cake for Seawater/KCL/Polymer mud was found to be three fold for Freshwater/Gypsum/Lignosulphonate...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the filter cake hydraulic conductivity and its impact on the hydraulic capacity of textile filters for wastewater treatment. The study was carried out using septic tank effluent filtered on four types of filters of different thickness (0. 9, 1. 8, 3. 6 and 7. 2 mm). The dry biomass content was 13. 45 – 36. 7 mg TS per 1 cm 2 at organic loading rate of 0. 04 – 0. 07 mg BOD 5 per 1 mg d. m. per day. The filter <b>cake</b> <b>dry</b> <b>mass</b> was related to filter thickness. The dry mass content of filter cake was about 9. 7 – 19. 1 % of whole filter cross-sectional profile TS content in the long-term experiment. The filter cake had a significant impact on the hydraulic capacity reduction due to its high density and small porosity. The volumetric density of filter cake biomass was almost twice as high as the volumetric density of biomass inside the textile filter. The filter hydraulic conductivity of a one-layer filter without filter cake was over four orders of magnitude higher than the hydraulic conductivity of a one-layer filter with filter cake formed during the short-term experiment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of a wavelet image {{decomposition}} applied to electron microscope images in order to estimate the mass transfer coefficient of pharmaceutical cakes obtained by freeze-drying. The structure analysis of <b>dried</b> <b>cakes</b> obtained by means of a free-drying process, is a basic step for tuning the process conditions and for monitoring the quality of the dried product. The product structure and specifically its porosity affects the drying duration as it defines the resistance to the vapor flow during the ice sublimation. This parameter is becoming quite important as it is fundamental for modeling of the freeze-drying process and thus for an optimal design of the freeze-drying cycle. The direct measurement of this parameter is quite complex thus new simple approaches are being developed for its non-invasive estimation. This paper discusses the possibility of processing SEM images of the <b>dried</b> <b>cake</b> to analyze its morphology and to estimate the mass transfer coefficient. This approach has already been followed by processing the images via a 2 D-FFT, here a faster solution based on the image wavelet decomposition followed by a non-linear processing based on an artificial neural network is described and the results are compared with the one obtained by the traditional direct mass transfer coefficient measuremen...|$|R

Recovery process was done by dissolving SSW with NaOH and NH 4 solution in a flask while stirring and boiling. Then a solution of NH 4 OH was added to precipitate Al(OH) 3 before it was filtered and washed with NH 4 Cl solution {{and then it was}} dried to get <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> solids.

In most cases, it is {{the final}} processingfacility of Effluent Treatment System (ETS) before it is sent out for final disposal, either through landfill or handing it overto a third party body with some economic impacts. Efficiency of the SDP determines the economic impact should this bio-sludge is handed over to a third party body for disposal. The resultant of the dry solid produced from the SDP can alsotremendously affect the overall process costs. In an ideal state, the dry solid produces contain 0 % water content; however,in an actual plant 0 % water content can never be achieved.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of electro-osmotic dewatering (EOD) {{is quite different}} from that of mechanical dewatering. Compared with the mechanical dewatering, EOD can be remarkably effective for hardly dewaterable suspensions of very fine particles and gelatinous materials. However, the gradual discontinuity of liquid state in the dewatering material, due to the formation of an unsaturated layer at the anode, causes the electrical blockage rendering EOD no longer effective. Mixing is believed to reduce such an effect. Therefore, a research is conducted to investigate this effect by having the anode rotating. An experimental apparatus was specially designed for this study. It consisted of one acrylic plastic cylinder, one porous stainless steel plate and one circular stainless steel plate. The porous plate acted as the cathode, and the circular plate as the rotating anode. Bentonite sludge, with 9. lwt% initial solid content was used as the model sludge. The rotational speed varied from 0 to 300 rpm. Three commercial impellers (axial flow impeller, high-shear dispersing impeller and high-shear radial flow impellers) were also used as rotating anodes and tested for their performances on EOD. The experimental results showed that, by using a flat plate as the rotating anode, the water removed from the sludge increased significantly with the rotational speed initially and reached a plateau at 240 rpm. This was believed due to the "fall-off" of the cake from the anode during the rotation. The solid content of the cake could be 23. 0 wt%, 60 % better than the performance of normal EOD. Besides, the excessive suspension added {{on the top of the}} anode was found to have a beneficial effect for both water removal and suppression of <b>drier</b> <b>cake</b> formation. It was also found that a constant thickness of the cake formed (about 5 mm) was more efficient in electro-osmotic dewatering. The combined effects of anode rotation and <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> thickness control could remove 56 % of the initial moisture within the suspension. It was 37 % better than normal EOD. Different commercial impellers performed similarly at the rotational speed of 240 rpm. In addition, the value of rpm= 60 was found to be the most effective condition for dewatering in the case of using high shear dispersing impeller. At this optimal condition, the water removal enhancement was comparable with those obtained using the rotating plate with the <b>dry</b> <b>cake</b> thickness control. The interesting experimental results were well explained following the fundamental analysis of EOD...|$|R

50|$|In the {{cylindrical}} {{section of}} the decanter centrifuge, the pool should ideally be shallow in order to maximise G-force for separation. Alternatively, a deeper pool is advantageous when the cake layer is too thick and the finer particles entrain into the fast liquid stream, since a thicker buffer liquid layer is present to help settle suspended solids. The compromise between cake dryness and clarity of centrate is to be considered. The reason behind this trade-off is that in losing fine solids to centrate, the cake with bigger particles is able to dewater more effectively which results in <b>drier</b> <b>cake.</b> Optimal pool for a particular application should be identified through the conduction of tests.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of flow instabilities into a microfiltration process can dramatically change several {{elements such as}} the surface-renewal rate, permeate flux, specific cake resistance, and cake buildup on the membrane in a positive way. A recently developed surface-renewal model for constant-pressure, cross-flow microfiltration (Hasan et al., 2013) {{is applied to the}} permeate-flux data reported by Mallubhotla and Belfort (1997), one set of which included flow instabilities (Dean vortices) while the other set did not. The surface-renewal model has two forms - the complete model and an approximate model. For the complete model, the {{introduction of}} vortices leads to a 53 % increase in the surface-renewal rate, which increases the limiting (i. e., steady-state) permeate flux by 30 %, decreases the specific cake resistance by 14. 5 % and decreases the limiting <b>cake</b> <b>mass</b> by 15. 5 % compared to operation without vortices. For the approximate model, a 50 % increase in the value of surface renewal rate is shown due to vortices, which increases the limiting permeate flux by 30 %, decreases the specific cake resistance by 10. 5 % and decreases the limiting <b>cake</b> <b>mass</b> by 13. 7 %. The cake-filtration version of the critical-flux model of microfiltration (Field et al., 1995) is also compared against the experimental permeate-flux data of Mallubhotla and Belfort (1997). Although this model can represent the data, the quality of its fit is inferior compared to that of the surface-renewal model...|$|R

Compared {{to the other}} extraction solutions investigated, " 1 % Tween 20 and 0. 4 % Triton X- 100 " and " 4 % SDS" are the most qualified extractants to isolate proteins of hen's egg or milk. Comparing calculated protein recovery rates of egg and milk powder extracts the results clearly indicate that {{the choice of a}} suitable extractant is of particular importance. Qualitative investigation of the extracts via LDS - PAGE followed by silver staining as well as immunoblotting confirmed the results of protein quantification. Hence, the immunoblots showed that the used extraction agents had no negative influence onto the antigenicity of the extracted allergenic proteins. In this study, variation of extraction temperature neither led to any benefit in extraction quality nor to degradation. Changing pH did not reveal any tendencies but a progressive protein hydrolysis at strong alkaline. Evaluation of recovery rates as well as results of unspecific and specific staining of the extracts revealed that an extraction duration of one hour is sufficient for an appropriate sample preparation. For investigations with and without food matrix different results were obtained. In summary, wheat starch did not influence the extraction quality within all examined materials and different extractants.
