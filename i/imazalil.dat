They can be controlled using fungicide as <b>Imazalil,</b> (IMZ) and fruits are generally treated on-line in the packing line. One of the more effective treatments is the fruit immersion in a tub located on the packing line after the fruit dumping. However, at the present the fungicide concentration during the whole day, related {{to the amount of}} fruit packed in the line, is not controlled. The aim of this work has been to set up a technique to monitor the <b>Imazalil</b> concentration in the washing tubs used for the dip treatment of citrus fruits. With this aim, several parameters of the water/Imazalil solution have been tested, as pH, conductivity and redox potential, but they have shown no correlation with the <b>Imazalil</b> concentration. Then the spectrophotometry has been used to assay the <b>Imazalil</b> concentration: sample solutions (0. 5 to 250 ppm) have been exposed to ultraviolet (UV) and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths.

Bacteria were enumerated by traditional plate spreading on Gould's S 1 agar (Pseudomonas) and as filamentous colonies on Winogradsky agar (actinomycetes) and by two quantitative competitive PCR assays. For this we developed an assay targeting Streptomyces and closely related genera. DR 54 constituted more than 75 % of the Pseudomonas population at the root base during the first 21 days but decreased to less than 10 % at day 50. DR 54 was not successful in colonizing root tips.

Os fungicidas testados foram: azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, hipoclorito de sódio, <b>imazalil,</b> oxicloreto de cobre, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, {{thiabendazol}} e tiofanato metílico, nas concentrações de 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 e 1. 000 ppm para avaliar a inibição do crescimento do micélio e 0, 1, 10, 50 e 100 ppm para testar inibição da germinação de conídios. Os fungicidas azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, <b>imazalil,</b> prochloraz, propiconazol e tebuconazol apresentaram alta eficiência na inibição do crescimento micelial. Os fungicidas dos grupos dos benzimidazóis (thiabendazol e tiofanato metílico) mostraram baixa eficiência e ineficiência, respectivamente, no controle do patógeno, demonstrando uma tolerância do isolado em estudo a estes produtos. O hipoclorito de sódio também apresentou baixa eficiência no controle do crescimento micelial do fungo. Quanto à inibição da germinação dos conídios, os fungicidas que demonstraram maior eficiência em baixas concentrações foram: chlorotalonil e hipoclorito de sódio. The efficiency of fungicides on Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was evaluated in vitro in the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Diseases Management of the Department of Phytopathology /UFLA. The fungicides were applied either in BDA medium or in glass slide chambers, {{the latter to}} assess the effects on conidial germination. The fungicides tested were: azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, sodium hypochloride, <b>imazalil,</b> copper oxychloride, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, thiabendazol and thiophanate-methyl in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1. 000 ppm to evaluate the inhibition of the mycelial growth and in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 50 and 100 ppm to test inhibition of the conidial germination. The fungicides azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, <b>imazalil,</b> prochloraz, propiconazol and tebuconazol presented high efficiency in the inhibition of the mycelial growth. The fungicides of the benzimidazol group (thiabendazol and thiophanate-methyl) showed low efficiency in the control of C. gloeosporioides. Sodium hypochloride showed low efficiency in {{the control of the}} mycelial growth of the fungus. For inhibition of the conidial germination, the fungicides oxychloride, chlorothalonil and sodium hypochloride showed high efficiency, even at low concentrations. C. gloeosporioides showed to be tolerant to the fungicides thiabendazole and thiophanate-methyl, as conidial germination and mycelial growth were not affected in the presence of these products...|$|E
40|$|Two single-copy genes, {{designated}} atrA and atrB (ATP-binding cassette transporter A and B), were cloned {{from the}} filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans and sequenced. Based {{on the presence}} of conserved motifs and on hydropathy analysis, the products encoded by atrA and atr B can be regarded as novel members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters. Both products share the same topology as the ABC transporters PDR 5 and SNQ 2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and CDR 1 from Candida albicans, which are involved in multidrug resistance of these yeasts. Significant homology also occurs between the ATP-binding cassettes of AtrA and AtrB, and those of mammalian ABC transporters (P-glycoproteins). The transcription of atrA and, in particular, atrB in mycelium of A. nidulans is strongly enhanced by treatment with several drugs, including antibiotics, azole fungicides and plant defense toxins. The enhanced transcription is detectable within a few minutes after drug treatment and coincides with the beginning of energy-dependent drug efflux activity, reported previously in the fungus for azole fungicides. Transcription of the atr genes has been studied in a wild-type and in a series of isogenic strains carrying the imaA and/or imaB genes, which confer multidrug resistance to various toxic compounds such as the azole fungicide <b>imazalil.</b> atrB is constitutively transcribed at a low level in the wild-type and in strains carrying imaA or imaB. <b>Imazalil</b> treatment enhances transcription of atrB to a similar extent in all strains tested. atrA, unlike atrB, displays a relatively high level of constitutive expression in mutants carrying imaB. <b>Imazalil</b> enhances transcription of atrA more strongly in imaB mutants, suggesting that the imaB locus regulates atrA. Functional analysis demonstrated that cDNA of atrB can complement the drug hypersensitivity associated with PDR 5 deficiency in S. cerevisiae...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{interesting}} {{side effects of}} the imidazole fungicide <b>imazalil</b> (IMA) {{can be observed in}} diverse tissue cultured plant species. Excessive shoot formation in Araceae, inhibition of bushiness in Gerbera, restoration of normal embryo development in Citrus and histogenic instability of Ficus benjamina chimeras will be discussed. Although some of these cases suggest that IMA inhibits GA biosynthesis and ABA metabolism, experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana indicate that IMA is also a strong brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor...|$|E
