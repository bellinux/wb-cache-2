500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, the Agnews prospered. Theodore {{acquired}} a larger restaurant, the Piccadilly, {{and moved the}} family to {{a house in the}} Forest Park section of the city, where Spiro attended Garrison Junior High School and later Forest Park High School. This period of affluence ended with the crash of 1929, and the restaurant closed. In 1931 the family's savings were wiped out when a local bank failed, forcing them to sell the house and move to a small apartment. Agnew later recalled how his father responded to these misfortunes: [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>shrugged</b> it off and went to work with his hands without complaint." [...] Theodore Agnew sold fruit and vegetables from a roadside stall, while the youthful Spiro helped the family's budget with part-time jobs, delivering groceries and distributing leaflets. As he grew up, Spiro was increasingly influenced by his youthful peers, and began to distance himself from his Greek background. He refused his father's offer to pay for Greek language lessons, and preferred to be known by a nickname, [...] "Ted".|$|E

2500|$|But, it {{was their}} {{reputation}} for business probity, innovative management and strict fiscal policies that sustained their partnership's success in a period where businesses operated in a highly volatile and uncertain environment where the line between success and bankruptcy was extremely thin. Jardine {{was known for his}} legendary imperiousness and pride. [...] He was nicknamed by the locals [...] "The Iron-headed Old Rat" [...] after being hit on the head by a club in Guangzhou. Jardine, after being hit, <b>just</b> <b>shrugged</b> off the injury with dour resilience. He had only one chair in his office in the [...] "Creek Hong" [...] in Canton, and that was his own. Visitors were never allowed to sit, to impress upon them that Jardine was a very busy man. Jardine was also known as a crisis manager. In 1822, during his visit to the firm's Guangzhou office, he found the local office in management crisis, with employees in near mutiny against the firm's officers. Jardine then proceeded to take temporary control and succeeded in putting the office in order in just a matter of days. Also a shrewd judge of character, Jardine was even able to persuade the Rev. Charles Gutzlaff, a Prussian missionary, to interpret for their ship captains during coastal smuggling of opium, using the idea that the reverend would best gather more converts during these smuggling operations. Matheson claimed to own the only piano in Asia and was also an accomplished player. He was also responsible for removing one of the firm's ship captains for refusing to offload opium chests on the Sabbath, Matheson observed, [...] "We have every respect for persons entertaining strict religious principles, but we fear that very godly people are not suited for the drug trade." ...|$|E
