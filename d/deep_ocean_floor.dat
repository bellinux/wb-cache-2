5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, Google {{increased}} {{the resolution of}} some <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> areas from 1-kilometer grids to 100 meters. The high-resolution features were developed by oceanographers at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory from scientific data collected on research cruises. The sharper focus is available for about 5 percent of the oceans. This {{can be seen in}} the Hudson off New York City, the Wini Seamount near Hawaii, and the Mendocino Ridge off the U.S Pacific coast.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{sediment}} is deposited differs depending on the location. A channel in a tidal flat can see the deposition of a few metres of sediment in one day, while on the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> each year only a few millimetres of sediment accumulate. A distinction can be made between normal sedimentation and sedimentation caused by catastrophic processes. The latter category includes all kinds of sudden exceptional processes like mass movements, rock slides or flooding. Catastrophic processes can see the sudden deposition of {{a large amount of}} sediment at once. In some sedimentary environments, most of the total column of sedimentary rock was formed by catastrophic processes, even though the environment is usually a quiet place. Other sedimentary environments are dominated by normal, ongoing sedimentation.|$|E
25|$|The second {{piece of}} {{evidence}} in support of continental drift came during the late 1950s and early 60s from data on the bathymetry of the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> {{and the nature of the}} oceanic crust such as magnetic properties and, more generally, with the development of marine geology which gave evidence for the association of seafloor spreading along the mid-oceanic ridges and magnetic field reversals, published between 1959 and 1963 by Heezen, Dietz, Hess, Mason, Vine & Matthews, and Morley.|$|R

25|$|Beginning in the 1950s, {{scientists}} like Victor Vacquier, using magnetic instruments (magnetometers) {{adapted from}} airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines, began recognizing odd magnetic variations {{across the ocean}} floor. This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt—the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor—contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. This distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded the Earth's magnetic field at the time.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the coral}} reefs {{we can see}} today were formed after the last glacial period when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the {{continental}} shelves. This means that most modern coral reefs are less than 10,000 years old. As communities established themselves on the shelves, the reefs grew upwards, pacing rising sea levels. Reefs that rose too slowly could become drowned reefs. They are covered by so much water that there was insufficient light. Coral reefs {{are found in the}} deep sea away from continental shelves, around oceanic islands and as atolls. The vast majority of these islands are volcanic in origin. The few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> on the surface.|$|E

Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills).|$|E
500|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea. Most species avoid {{locations}} {{with strong}} currents or waves, and typical sites include rocky overhangs, crevices and caves, steep slopes of continental shelves, and in <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b> However, some articulate species attach to kelp or in exceptionally sheltered sites in intertidal zones. The smallest living brachiopod, Gwynia, is only about [...] long, and lives in between gravel. Rhynchonelliforms (Articulata excluding Craniida), whose larvae consume only their yolks and settle and develop quickly, specialize in specific areas and form dense populations that can reach thousands per meter. Young adults often attach to the shells of more mature ones. On the other hand, inarticulate brachiopods, whose larva swim {{for up to a}} month before settling, have wide ranges. Members of the discinoid genus Pelagodiscus have a cosmopolitan distribution.|$|R
50|$|Calveriosoma gracile {{grows to}} a {{diameter}} of about 2.4 cm and is scantily covered in short spines. It has a somewhat flattened globose shape resembling a cushion. It {{is one of a}} group of echinoderms that instead of having a rigid test consisting of fused calcareous plates, has a flexible leathery skin with loose, wedge-shaped plates embedded in it. This makes the boundaries between the plates easy to observe. Other distinguishing characteristics include hollow spines tipped with hoof-like structures and simple mouthparts. Echinoderms in this order were known only as fossils having been found in deposits such as the chalk beds of southern England dating back to the Cretaceous era. It was only in the Challenger expedition of the 1870s that living members of the group were found, when <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> were dredged to investigate the organisms living at these great depths.|$|R

500|$|Large {{quantities}} of methane clathrate {{exist on the}} seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around [...] and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometers (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are manganese nodules formed of layers of iron, manganese, and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the <b>deep</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for nickel was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources. In suitable locations, diamonds are gathered from the seafloor using suction hoses to bring gravel ashore. In deeper waters, mobile seafloor crawlers are used and the deposits are pumped to a vessel above. In Namibia, more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land.|$|E

To {{the east of}} the lake and the park is a ridge of bedrock composed of Kittatinny Formation (a supergroup) materials that rests on the Martinsburg Formation, which includes Bushkill Member, Allentown Dolomite, Beekmantown Group, and Jacksonburg Limestone. These materials of these bedrock formations included geological components of a large Precambrian or Mesozoic continent that separated and subsequently was periodically submerged beneath shallow seas. During these intervals, these components accumulated a layer of deposited marine sediment and carbonate rock during the Ordovician and Silurian eras.

50|$|The {{benthic region}} of the ocean begins at the shore line (intertidal or eulittoral zone) and extends {{downward}} along {{the surface of the}} continental shelf out to sea.
