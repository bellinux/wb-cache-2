40|$|A {{study of}} stress {{birefringence}} in models of pellicles has been conducted. Models {{have been examined}} {{in terms of their}} <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> of stress. The intensity variations in exposure due to these lines has been characterized for a pellicle model under diametral compression. It has been found that exposure variation due to pellicle stress birefringence is below one percent...|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} system of stress distribution in granular systems were developed using photoelasticity. Stress transmission among {{two types of}} acrylic resin cylinders with diameters of 8 mm or 10 mm and a height of 10 mm were measured by using the stress {{measurement system}} based on photoelasticity. Photoelastic fringe patterns of isoclinic lines and <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> in the acrylic resin cylinders were observed. As a preliminary result，we observed the stress distribution and heterogeneous stress transmission in the granular system under compression.

40|$|The {{isoclinic}} parameter can {{be determined}} from points of intersection of two systems of characteristic <b>lines</b> called secondary <b>isochromatics.</b> These <b>lines,</b> along which the light intensity is a minimum, {{can be observed in}} monochromatic light in an originally linear polariscope with two crossed quarter-wave plates in which the polarizer and analyser have been rotated through small angles in opposite directions. The theory of the polariscope, based on Jones’s metric equations, is given and the influence of imperfect quarter-wave plates is discussed. The effect of light of incorrect wave-length on the resulting error is con-sidered. A disc loaded by two opposite compression forces is used for demonstration of the methods...|$|R

Classical wave, vibrating, shock and rotating parts theories, {{were compared with}} colour pictures of <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> obtained with rapid camera and urethane resin specimens. For non-linear shock and large deflection, explicit code LSDYNA has been used. Then, the facility {{has been used to}} analyse dynamic work of gears for power transmission, in comparison with numerical computations. These developments have lead to demonstrations now included in engineering general courseware, about stress analysis : theory of elasticity and dynamics of structures. Gear visualisation have been included in integrated France-Canada developments concerning dynamics of transmission, as a complement with theoretical models and experimental acoustic analysis of functioning gears...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the plain snap gauge of Epoxy Resin under the tension load are studied qualitatively by photoelastic showing the fringe order, the <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> and the isoclinics. As the results, the distribution curves of the fringe order are greatly influenced by the length, the width and {{the shapes of the}} gauge arm. Some singular points are observed in an U notch type, and double notch type has one more singular point compare with a single notch type. The expanse of several types in practical materials under the tension load are measured by strain meter and micro meter. As the results the authors find that U notch type has minimum value in testing pieces. ...|$|E
40|$|Quantitat ive {{valuation}} method for stress in crystal was establ ished by photoelasticity. It {{consists of three}} procedures: measurement by plane po-larized light, measurement by circularly polarized light, and piezo-optical coefficients calculation. The last method is indispensable for stress evaluation in crystal. Piezo-optical coefficients for silicon in the [110] ~lO] [001] and [112] ~ 10] [l l l J coordinate system were calculated from the values in the [100] [010] [001] coordinate system measured by Giardini. Practical ap-proximation was made to correlate each isochromatic l ine direct ly {{to the difference between}} two principal stresses. This method was applied to the evaluation of the stress in silicon semiconductor pellet caused in the mounting and molding process. Observation of <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> according to tempera-ture was practical for determinat ion of the zeroth order of retardation. Photoelastic measurement is one of the important methods used for crystal characterization. However...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{nucleation}} and propagation of shear cracks along nonplanar, kinked, and branched fault paths {{corresponding to the}} configurations used in recent laboratory fracture studies by Rousseau and Rosakis (2003, 2009). The aim is to reproduce numerically those shear rupture experiments and from that provide an insight into processes which are active when a crack, initially propagating in mode II along a straight path, interacts with {{a bend in the}} fault or a branching junction. The experiments involved impact loading of thin Homalite- 100 (a photoelastic polymer) plates, which had been cut along bent or branched paths and weakly glued back together everywhere except along a starter notch near the impact site. Strain gage recordings and high-speed photography of <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines</b> provided characterization of the transient deformation fields associated with the impact and fracture propagation. We found that dynamic explicit 2 -D plane-stress finite element analyses with a simple linear slip-weakening description of cohesive and frictional strength of the bonded interfaces can reproduce the qualitative rupture behavior past the bend and branch junctions in most cases and reproduce the principal features revealed by the photographs of dynamic isochromatic line patterns. The presence of a kink or branch can cause an abrupt change in rupture propagation velocity. Additionally, the finite element results allow comparison between total slip accumulated along the main and inclined fault segments. We found that slip along inclined faults can be substantially less than slip along the main fault, and the amount depends on the branch angle and kink or branch configuration...|$|E
40|$|The {{color of}} {{automotive}} coatings varies with illumination and detection angles. For 3 D rendering of these coatings currently {{two categories of}} methods exist, aiming at either color accuracy or at computational speed. Current methods that aim for color accuracy are based on measurement data from BRDF instruments. Since many hundreds of measurement geometries are needed to capture the color variation with angles, these methods require timeexpensive interpolation of large three-dimensional Look-Up Tables. Current methods that aim for computational speed use physically crude approximations, usually taking into account color variations with respect to {{only one of the}} four angular dimensions. Here, we derive a new approach for 3 D rendering of automotive and other gonio-apparent coatings, which is a dedicated form of microfacet models. It aims at improved color accuracy as compared to the current computationally inexpensive methods, combined with higher computational speed and lower cost as compared to current color-accurate rendering techniques. The new approach utilizes a recently developed physical analysis method, introducing flake-based parameters and <b>isochromatic</b> <b>lines,</b> for the reflection properties of automotive coatings. This makes it more accurate than current fast rendering methods. The new method naturally leads to two-rather than three-dimensional Look Up Tables, which explains the small computation time it needs. We show that when applied to 3 D rendering, this method indeed leads to accurate 3 D rendering of automotive coatings while requiring reduced computation times. For numerical errors found in some special cases, solutions are found and tested. © 2015 Society for Imaging Science and Technology. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
