25|$|Capital {{budgeting}} is {{also concerned}} with the setting of criteria about which projects should receive investment funding to increase {{the value of the}} firm, and whether to finance that investment with equity or <b>debt</b> <b>capital.</b> Investments should be {{made on the basis of}} value-added to the future of the corporation. Projects that increase a firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments, including but not limited to, expansion policies, or mergers and acquisitions. When no growth or expansion is possible by a corporation and excess cash surplus exists and is not needed, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a share buyback program.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, the foreign {{liabilities}} {{of the majority of}} countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have grown dramatically, propelling most nations into the status of Highly Indebted Poor Countries, when these liabilities reached unsustainable levels in the 1990 s. At the same time, increases in capital flight from the region followed a parallel trend, leading scholars to draw on"revolving door"models to explain the apparent positive covariation of external <b>debt</b> and <b>capital</b> flight in the region. This paper investigates the causality between external <b>debt</b> and <b>capital</b> flight in a cross-section of Sub-Saharan African countries using co-integration and error-correction models. Although dual causality, which is consistent with the revolving door hypothesis, cannot be rejected for the majority of countries, empirical evidence highlights the lead of external <b>debt</b> over <b>capital</b> flight. The significance of error-correction terms points to a long-run co-integrating relationship between external <b>debt</b> and <b>capital</b> flight in a large number of countries.

Investment banking fees on Wall Street totaled approximately $40 billion in 2012, while in 2013, senior New York City bank officers who manage risk and compliance functions earned as much as $324,000 annually. In fiscal year 2013–14, Wall Street's securities industry generated 19% of New York State's tax revenue. New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and <b>debt</b> <b>capital</b> markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy. In July 2013, NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association. New York also leads in hedge fund management; private equity; and the monetary volume of mergers and acquisitions.

[...] Debt payments can also {{be made in the}} form of sinking fund provisions, whereby the corporation pays annual installments of the borrowed debt above regular interest charges. [...] Corporations that issue callable bonds are entitled to pay back the obligation in full whenever the company feels it is in their best interest to pay off the debt payments. [...] If interest expenses cannot be made by the corporation through cash payments, the firm may also use collateral assets as a form of repaying their debt obligations (or through the process of liquidation).|$|E
