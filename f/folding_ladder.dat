Jim was reconnoitring the smoking-room. Suddenly, close beside Mr Watkins in the bushes, there was a violent crash and a stifled curse. Someone had tumbled over the wire which his assistant had just arranged. He heard feet running on the gravel pathway beyond. Mr Watkins, like all true artists, was a singularly shy man, and he incontinently dropped his <b>folding</b> <b>ladder</b> and began running circumspectly through the shrubbery. He was indistinctly aware of two people hot upon his heels, and he fancied that he distinguished the outline of his assistant in front of him.

When they finally broke it out Bethune had already hoisted the mainsail. There was no time to lose, for the fog was getting thicker in spite of the rising wind, and a glimmering mass of ice had crept up threateningly close. Moreover, the light was going and the sea getting up. Hurriedly setting a small jib, they stood out for open sea.|$|E

Displacement of the THF solvate in 2 a is readily achieved with TMEDA to afford Li(Ph 2 PC{NiPr} 2) (TMEDA) (3 a). X-Ray crystallographic analyses show that 2 a exists as a dimer in the solid state with a <b>folded</b> <b>ladder</b> structure and an N,N chelating phosphaguanidinate, while 3 a is monomeric with N,P-coordination of the ligand to lithium. Compound 2 a reacts via a transmetallation pathway with AlMe 2 Cl to afford the dimethylaluminium complex, Al(Ph 2 PC{NiPr} 2) Me 2 (4 a), which can also be prepared by protonation of a methyl group of AlMe 3 using 1 a. The formation of a series of dialkylaluminium compounds has been investigated employing this latter pathway using both 1 a and the N,N-dicyclohexyl analogue, Ph 2 PC{NCy}{NHCy}(1 b), affording Al(Ph 2 PC{NR} 2) Et 2 (5 a, b), Al(Ph 2 PC{NR} 2) iBu 2 (6 a, b) and the diphenylaluminium compound Al(Ph 2 PC{NiPr} 2) Ph 2 (7 a). The oily nature of most of the dialkyl compounds and high sensitivity to oxygen and moisture lead to difficulty in manipulation and characterization; however, NMR spectroscopy indicated highly pure products (> 95 %) upon removal of the solvent. The molecular structures of the crystalline examples 4 a and 7 a are reported, showing monomeric aluminium species with symmetrically chelating phosphaguanidinate ligands. The series of aluminium compounds AlLCl 2 {L =[EC{NiPr} 2]¿: A, E = Me; B, E = Me 2 N; C, E =(Me 3 Si) 2 N and D, E = Ph 2 P} were investigated using density functional theory. In the more simple cases A and B, the delocalized electron density of the metallacycle was represented by a combination of the HOMO and an orbital of lower energy (A, HOMO- 5; B, HOMO- 6). The HOMO- 1 in B was -bonded across the Me 2 N¿C bond suggesting delocalization of electron density into the metallacycle. In the more complex systems C and D, delocalization within the metallacycle was less extensive due to the (Me 3 Si) 2 N- and Ph 2 P-moieties. A number of occupied orbitals in D, however, display phosphorus lone-pair characteristics, indicating that these species have the potential to behave as Lewis bases in the formation of poly(metallic) systems...|$|R

50|$|Between 1438 and 1446 (several {{decades before}} the {{activities}} of Leonardo da Vinci), he created manuscripts in Latin {{on a wide variety}} of technical subjects, including astronomy, hydraulics, astronomical instruments, and drawings of apparent inventions like a <b>folding</b> <b>ladder</b> and a gem polishing machine. Among the manuscripts is a copy (in Henri's handwriting) of Jacob of Liège's Speculum musicae.

He gave a detailed description of the action and the operation of this keyboard plucked instrument with the complex linkages between the keyboard and the strings. He also described the lute, the clavichord, the dulce melos, and the organ. All instruments were to be played at the court and not in churches. The manuscripts were probably only bundled in the 16th century (F-Pn Lat. 7295).|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} cavers in Europe and North America {{were limited}} in their explorations {{by a lack of}} suitable equipment. Explorers of the early 1800s, when caving began to become more common, caved in tweed suits and used candles for illumination. Exploration was usually limited to drier caves as there was little to protect cavers from the cold once they became wet. Later, cavers began to adopt miners lamps, which were designed for underground use and were reasonably reliable, though their light was not especially powerful. Lighting magnesium strips was a popular way of illuminating large chambers. E.A. Martel, a French caver, created a collapsible canvas canoe which he used to explore several caves containing long flooded sections, such as the Marble Arch Cave in Northern Ireland. His expeditionary equipment was describe in 1895 as: [...] "a canvas boat, some hundreds of feet of rope - ladders, a light portable <b>folding</b> wooden <b>ladder,</b> ropes, axes, compass, barometer, telephone, map etc.'". Acetylene lamps, powered by carbide, {{was one of the main}} light sources used by cavers during the 20th century. Electric miners headlamps, powered by lead-acid batteries were later used, eventually superseded by LED lighting, which offers superior duration and brightness and is considerably lighter.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{redesign}} a rough vision of a product intended to transform the hunting industry. A provided prototype utilized an off the shelf hinged ladder and aluminum piping structure to transform the prototype into five different configurations. By attaching different outer aluminum members, <b>folding</b> the <b>ladder,</b> and attaching wheels, the product could be covered by canvas {{for use as a}} laydown blind, single-person sit-down blind, three-person bench blind, game hauler, or ladder for tree stand access. Currently, the market offers different products for each of these functions; the sponsor 2 ̆ 7 s objective was to produce a single product {{that could be used for}} all five configurations mentioned above. Because the early design was bulky, heavy, and cumbersome to assemble, our primary focus was to analyze consumer assembly methods and create a proprietary base platform. The major shortcomings that lead the team to redesign the base were non-level seat when in bench blind configuration, failure where modifications had been made to the stock base, and the fact the ladder was being used for a purpose that it wasn’t designed for, which makes failure of components unpredictable. Designing a custom base also will reduce the manufacturing cost and remove the concern of the off the shelf product being redesigned or discontinued. To complete project all attaching members were redesigned with quick-release joints for easy, user-friendly setup and breakdown...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} work is to target the demand for high-speed medium-resolution ADCs for satellite communication systems. An 8 -bit, 12. 5 GS/s folding-interpolating ADC was designed in 0. 25 µm, 190 GHz SiGe BiCMOS technology from IHP. The ADC consists of a THA, a reference resistor <b>ladder,</b> <b>folding</b> amplifiers, an interpolating resistor string, a comparator array, a digital encoder, a coarse quantizer and a bit synchronizer. Post-layout simulation results of the ADC verify that its performance meets all the required specifications.

5000|$|Because at {{the time}} the Model 52 was {{developed}} many Army- and National Rifle Association-sponsored matches were restricted to [...] "military-style" [...] sights, and because Winchester had hopes of selling the 52 to the War Department as a marksmanship training rifle, Burton and Laudensack designed a <b>folding</b> <b>ladder</b> sight for the new target rifle. Designated 82A, it bore some resemblance to the sight on the M1903 Springfield, especially in its pivoting-base windage adjustment (albeit controlled by dual-opposed thumbscrews rather than the Springfield rack-and-worm). However, elevation adjustment was governed by a micrometer click-wheel for precision, not free-sliding like genuine military sights. The Burton-Laudensack helped Model 52 shooters sweep matches and set records throughout the 1920s, but more precise aftermarket sights took over the field and the increasingly obsolescent 82A was not offered after World War II.Winchester catalogs from the beginning listed 52's with sights by other makers; indeed, the buyer could specify any compatible peep on a special-order basis. The most common of these was the Lyman 48 series: the 48-J and -JH for flat-top dovetail-mount receivers, and the 48-F and -FH for round-top side-mount rifles (standard on the 52 Sporting Model). Other popular sights were the Lyman 525, the Wittek-Vaver 35-MIELT, the Marble Goss 52, and the Redfield 90 and 100. Late 52's frequently were fitted with Redfield [...] "Olympic" [...] or [...] "International" [...] match sights.|$|E
50|$|The K12 {{is based}} on the K3's design, layout, and {{function}} using a gas piston and rotating bolt. It is fed through a STANAG M13 disintegrating belt link and cannot accept a magazine. The cross-bolt type safety is the same as K3/Minimi, and the receiver is made from steel press with an aluminum alloy feed cover. Although similar in design, the receiver and other important parts are enlarged to accommodate the larger round. The K12 is somewhat heavy for the gun class at 12 kg, mainly because it has pistol grip, spade grip, and metal sliding stock all in one gun for the purpose of being quickly converted into a ground-fire machine gun by a dismounted operator; the spade grip can be removed by taking out two pins, removing the grip, and unfolding the stock which is similar in design to the FN Minimi’s Para version. Standard machine gun features are included like a folding (K3-style) bipod, quick change barrel, gas regulator, and (M240H-style) flash suppressor. It also has a folding ring sight for firing on helicopters with a <b>folding</b> <b>ladder</b> type sight for more accurate aiming. The sight is attached on a Mil-Std 1913 rail, which is also on the feed cover and both sides of the handguard. No laser or optical sight has yet been selected for use on the K12, but some kind of electro-optical accessories are expected in the near future.|$|E

She grew up in Spreenhagen, in Brandenburg, and last lived on Birkenweg 13, in Spreenhagen. [...] "Micki," [...] as her friends called her, was a [...] "small, free-spirited and fun-loving person." [...] She and her friends really [...] "just {{wanted to live in}} peace, without any problems and without being forbidden to do anything," [...] her friend Falko Vogt later explained. During the school year, she had little contact with other students. Instead, during her spare time, she helped in a retirement home in the neighboring village of Grünheide, where she was very popular with senior citizens. She began her Reifenkombinat apprenticeship in 1979. Falko Vogt had been thinking about escaping for a long time. He and Marienetta Jirkowsky met Peter Wiesner together in spring 1980. He, too, had not adjusted to the conditions in East Germany and had applied a number of times for an exit permit to leave the country. When Marienetta Jirkowsky turned 18, the legal age of an adult under East German law, she became engaged to Peter Wiesner. They planned to move in together in the fall of 1980. This decision, however, led to major conflicts with her parents, who were opposed to their relationship, and feared {{that they were going to}} lose their only child. To prevent this from happening, they succeeded in getting a police order to ban Peter Wiesner from having any contact with their daughter. He was divorced, drank a lot, changed jobs often, prone to violence, and had a history of being in trouble with the police. After that, the three were just waiting for the right moment to leave East Germany. They planned to flee together on the night of 22 November 1980. In preparation for their escape Peter Wiesner created a <b>folding</b> <b>ladder,</b> which consisted of separate pieces, in his apartment.|$|E
