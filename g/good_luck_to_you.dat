2500|$|Murrow {{achieved}} great {{celebrity status}} {{as a result of}} his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with [...] "good night, and good luck." [...] The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said [...] "good night, and <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with [...] "Good night, and good luck." [...] Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.|$|E

Due to the change in address the package did arrive a little late for Christmas but in excellent condition. Your gift was welcomed because we boys in the service sure like to receive packages and news from the people back home. I enjoyed the last issue of the Bryant Alumni News because it was interesting to see how many of the Bryant graduates were in service and also to see how spread out they are all over the world. Although I am not personally acquainted with the members of your club I feel that I am one of you and hope that some day I shall be able <b>to</b> visit <b>you</b> all.

Hello Folks: It {{was a very}} {{pleasant}} surprise for me when your package arrived. It {{was also the first}} of many and thanks very much again. Unfortunately, censorship is such that one has difficulty writing any thing that might be very interesting. I have been able to visit my brother about six times since being stationed in England. The places we me are Manchester, Leicester; and Bedford. Also, have met one of my cousins at Oxford, Leicester, and Birmingham. It is a wonderful feeling seeing someone that is close, and all discomforts are forgotten with the pleasure of being together even for a very short time. Traveling is slow due to war time conditions. How do you people find travelling? Bikes are very common in most places. London is one of the exceptions. The underground (subway) is very good in London. It is even better than New York’s- believe it or not. <b>Good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> all of <b>you.</b> Meyer [Transcription ends...|$|R

Thanks to Chelsea Martinez for all her help in editing this dissertation and for not letting me be the only female in the group. Stevan Samuel was always there to provide entertainment. I will certainly miss his company and irrational statements, although I’m sure I will continue to see them on Facebook.
