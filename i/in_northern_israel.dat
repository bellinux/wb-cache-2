5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>Israel</b> and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Israel {{responded with}} airstrikes and {{artillery}} fire on targets in Lebanon that damaged Lebanese infrastructure, including Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport (which Israel said that Hezbollah used to import weapons and supplies), an air and naval blockade, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah then launched more rockets into northern Israel and engaged the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in guerrilla warfare from hardened positions. The war continued until 14 August 2006. Hezbollah {{was responsible for}} thousands of Katyusha rocket attacks against Israeli civilian towns and cities <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>Israel,</b> which Hezbollah said were in retaliation for Israel's killing of civilians and targeting Lebanese infrastructure. The conflict {{is believed to have}} killed 1,191–1,300 Lebanese citizens including combatants and 165 Israelis including soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Though it {{took the}} form of an Israeli {{military}} incursion into Southern Lebanon, Operation Litani was grounded in the long-running Israeli–Palestinian conflict. From 1968 on, the PLO, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and other Palestinian groups established a quasi-state in southern Lebanon, using it as a base for raids on civilian targets <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>Israel,</b> as well as worldwide terror attacks on Israeli and other targets. This was exacerbated by an influx of 3,000 PLO militants fleeing a defeat in the Jordanian civil war and regrouping in southern Lebanon. Israel responded with damaging attacks against PLO bases.|$|E

25|$|In 1969 the Shafdan {{wastewater}} treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in {{wastewater treatment}} under the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon {{wastewater treatment plant}} was completed <b>in</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Israel.</b> It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.|$|E

The excavation at el-Tabun produced the longest stratigraphic record in the region, spanning 600,000 or more years of human activity, from the Lower Paleolithic to the present day, representing roughly a million years of human evolution. Other notable Paleolithic sites include caves Qesem and Manot. The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh hominids, who lived <b>in</b> <b>northern</b> <b>Israel</b> 120,000 years ago.
