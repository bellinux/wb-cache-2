5|$|By December 2009 {{mephedrone}} {{was available}} {{on at least}} 31 websites based in the UK and by March 2010 {{there were at least}} 78 online shops, half of which sold amounts of less than 200grams and half that also sold bulk quantities. The price per gram varied from £9.50 to £14. Between July 2009 and February 2010, UK health professionals accessed the National Poisons Information Services (NPIS) entry on mephedrone 1664 times and made 157 telephone inquiries; the requests increased month on month over this period. In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries <b>for</b> <b>cocaine</b> and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen <b>for</b> <b>cocaine</b> and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

5000|$|The Fraternal Order of Police, a {{national}} organization of law enforcement officers, also opposed the Act. [...] It argued that because increased violence {{is associated with the}} use of crack, especially in urban areas, high penalties for crack-related offenses were justified, relying on U.S. Sentencing Commission statistics showing that 29% of all crack cases from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, involved a weapon, compared to only 16% <b>for</b> powder <b>cocaine.</b> The organization also stated that the enhanced penalties <b>for</b> crack <b>cocaine</b> [...] "have proven useful, and a better course of action would have been to instead raise the penalties <b>for</b> powder <b>cocaine</b> crimes." [...] The Fair Sentencing Act includes a provision to account for such aggravated cases, allowing penalties to be increased for the use of violence during a drug trafficking offense.|$|R
