They were there during World War II. They observed ships coming through the channel still burning from action in the war. The Dames Point Cut that straightened the river was signed off by George Bartchlett allowing the dredging to begin. He raised seven children and four grandchildren on this island. At that time {{the only way to}} {{the island was}} by boat. The house once set on the Dames Point side of the island. The children going to school caught the bus at the end of Dames point road. There is a lot of history to this island that once was a family's home. The St. Johns River between Jacksonville and the Atlantic Ocean twists and turns. That was not a problem until shipping companies began using bigger and bigger freighters after World War II. The United States Army Corps of Engineers created the Dames Point Cut, a straight channel that provided an alternative to the river's natural course, which contained several of the sharpest turns in the river. Four marsh islands received the <b>dredging</b> <b>spoil</b> and became Blount Island. The property was turned over to the Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) for development. The west side of the island was developed and used for freight operations after the Jacksonville Port Authority (JAXPORT) was established in 1963. Railroad access to the site was added in the late 1960s.|$|E

40|$|Documentary {{research}} {{calls attention}} to the historical and archaeological significance of an area that once consisted of three separate islands {{on the east side}} of the Hudson River below Albany. The area, called "Schodack, " included the traditional council fire of the Mahican Indians. The history of these islands can be traced from 1609, when Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, anchored near them through the colonial period. Despite extensive purchases of land by the Dutch elsewhere on both sides of the river soon after 1630, the Mahican Indian owners and. occupants of these fertile islands resisted selling them to the acquisitive Dutch until a period of crisis after 1660. Although a Mahican village continued to exist on the islands until the mid- 18 th century, the Mahicans were gradually dispersed through the combined effects of colonial wars and activities of land specu. lators and farmers, colonial officials, and missionaries.

Particularly wastes and by-products are employed which are resulting from sugar processing (calcium carbonate sludge), water supply (<b>dredging</b> <b>spoil),</b> exploration of quarry (fractions of minor quality, mineral powder), chemical industry (ammonium sulphate, various limy residues), treatment of water for industrial use (sludge from decarbonation) and iron and steel production (blast furnace cinder and converter slug).

40|$|Coring in the Lagoon of Venice mudflats along {{previously}} collected high-resolution subbottom seismic-reflection survey profile lines {{has enabled}} {{the collection of}} interlayered radiocarbon-datable terrestrial plant material. Along present and former meander bends, dipping laminated sandy channel-bank deposits rest in sharp lithostratigraphic and chronologic contrast to the adjacent and overlying mudflat deposits. Horizontal channel migration rates of roughly 10 to 20 meters per century are orders of magnitude faster than the minimum estimates of vertical mudflat silt accumulation, which range from 5 to 25 centimeters per century. Given the nearly 6000 -year history since the late-Holocene marine transgression that produced the initial lagoon environments of deposition, {{it is no surprise}} that channel meander migration has left a prevalence of channel-bank deposits in the subsurface lithostratigraphy. Furthermore, regional subsidence and rising relative sea level continue to enhance the net accumulation of mudflat and salt marsh deposition on top of the older deposits. Tapered variations of tidal-channel width, depth, and flow velocity, as well as wind-driven waves with associated intensities of turbulence along the meandering paths, lead to recognizable sediment grain size trends and lagoon deposit stratigraphy. Human interventions, such as <b>dredging,</b> <b>spoil</b> disposal, and powerboat wakes, introduce other contrasting processes and depositional features. For complete understanding of the depositional environments in the lagoon, the full set of dynamic processes and depositional consequences often need to be considered. Patterns and processes revealed in this case study probably have broad applicability to other coastal lagoon environments experiencing significant tidal flow and sea-level change...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} of <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for port expansion at Abbot Point in North Queensland, Australia, {{has been a}} contentious issue receiving extensive media coverage.

This paper identifies different perceptions of risk portrayed by local, regional, interstate and national print media in relation to the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> issue from January 2013 until February 2014. Media analysis explored the questions: how is 'risk' represented, who is linked to different risk perceptions, and how has the media coverage of the issue changed over time? Results show that 'risk' to the Great Barrier Reef from the <b>dredge</b> <b>spoil</b> was framed by four main themes: Environmental Disaster, Socio-economic Disaster, Equilibrium and Industrialism.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{policy in}} the Netherlands {{concerning}} waste recognises an order of preference, with prevention as the ideal solution, followed by reuse (either direct or after treatment) and confined disposal as the least preferred option. The reuse of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is the cheapest removal option {{and one that is}} frequently used. Treatment of <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> is more expensive than disposal and hence difficult to stimulate. Consequently, 2002 saw the introduction of a tax of â¬ 13. 48 per ton on the disposal of treatable <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils.</b> The environmental objective was to cancel out the economic advantage of disposal over processing and thus to encourage treatment. The introduction of this tax measure has had a number of positive effects:- In-situ sediment site investigations have been extended to include the determination of the sand content, and more attention is being paid to identifying sandy and non-sandy batches;- More accurate records of the dredging, transportation and disposal processes are being drawn up;- Treatment is being carried out under a quality assurance system geared towards maximising sand production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{laboratory}} scale study {{was carried out}} using Starkey medium to demonstrate the feasibility of using microbial methods for the bioleaching of heavy metals from contaminated spoils. Acidophilic bacteria, Acidithiobacillus species were isolated from abandoned <b>dredged</b> <b>spoils</b> that were produced during the dredging of oil well access canals in the Niger Delta. Two different composite <b>dredged</b> <b>spoil</b> samples were collected, suspended in Starkey medium and inoculated with {{the culture of the}} bacteria for 1 - 7 weeks. The heavy metal concentration of the sediment prior to the bioleaching are as follows: copper (121. 1 Â± 0. 30 mg/kg), cadmium (130. 8 Â± 0. 53 mg/kg), chromium (143 Â± 1. 00 mg/kg), nickel (138. 5 Â± 0. 36 mg/kg), manganese (296 Â± 2. 00 mg/kg) and zinc (131. 5 Â± 0. 50 mg/kg). During the leaching process, the results of the physico-chemical monitoring show that pH decreased from 3. 5 to < 2. 0, while sulphate, conductivity, redox potential, turbidity, iron and optical density of the leaching broth increased. The physical observations (colour, turbidity, slime production, utilization of sulphur crystals) correlated with the physico-chemical measurements. After seven weeks of bioleaching, the heavy metal recoveries from the spoil 1 are copper (89 %), cadmium (100 %), chromium (56 %), nickel (81 %), manganese (68 %) and lead (96 %).
