5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E

5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of Arabia to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing Islam <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>wake</b> and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of North Africa, called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E

In the long run, as Toohey (2008) reports, many of the hoped-for benefits failed to materialize.

The 1990s saw a resurgence of the goth subculture, fueled largely by crossover from the industrial, electronic and metal scenes; and goth culture and aesthetic again worked itself into the mainstream consciousness, inspiring thriving goth music scenes in most cities and notoriety throughout popular culture.|$|E

25|$|Wars and rebellions in some African {{countries}} have left many {{towns and villages}} deserted. Since 2003, when President François Bozizé came to power, thousands of citizens of the Central African Republic {{have been forced to}} flee their homes {{as a result of the}} escalating conflict between armed rebels and government troops. Villages accused of supporting the rebels, such as Beogombo Deux near Paoua, are ransacked by government soldiers; those who are not killed have no choice but to escape to refugee camps.

40|$|This is {{a chapter}} {{that deals with}} perhaps the most {{important}} item of furniture and its soft furnishings that any early modern probably invested in and owned. In 2001 Roger Ekirch suggested that the 'elusive realm of sleep' had been long ignored by historians of most stamps; only now are we 'waking up' to what he calls the 'profound role pre-industrial sleep played in the lives of ordinary men and women' being of concomitant importance as investigating what they did <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>waking</b> hours. And yet this is not a chapter about sleeping or dreaming or conversing with God or sexual congress, in bed.

40|$|There {{has been}} debate about animals’ {{contribution}} to ocean circulation, called biomixing, or biogenic mixing. The energy input of schooling fish is significant but the eddies {{may be too}} small; so energy is dissipated as heat before impacting oceanic structure. I suggest that high turbulence caused by some very large aggregations of small animals has an important impact via a more direct ecosystem feedback process than overall ocean circulation. In the model presented here, large schools exhibit cooperative behavior and act like giant sieves grading zooplankton through individual swimmer’s wakes, which focus the best prey in predictable positions. Following schoolers exploit these patterns. Then schools leave, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>wakes,</b> chaotic turbulence enhancing growth of the smaller zooplankton and phytoplankton which has been graded out by the school. The result is a different community structure of plankton than would exist without such biomixing. Changes to plankton abundance and community structure on oceanic scales {{over the past century}} are correlated to overfishing and are consistent with this concept...|$|R

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the Cape route, caravel ships of Portuguese Franciscans and Dominicans set out to evangelize the no longer sealed lands of the East, and traversed the coasts in search of suitable centres for their operations. A legend tells how, when a caravel with some Franciscan missionaries was cruising up the Coromandel Coast, towards nightfall their attention was attracted by a light on shore and they decided to land there. They did, without knowing for some time that they had landed at the ruins of Betumah. But when they attempted to approach the light, it preceded them inland, across the ruins of the Nestorian town, over an empty stretch of ground, past (new) Mylapur and into a forest, where the light vanished. Here the Franciscans established a mission and built a church (still extant) in honour of Our Lady of Light in 1516, whence the locality, no longer a forest, but a wealthy residential quarter, is still known as The Luz—after Nossa Senhora da Luz (Portuguese for Our Lady of Light). The Dominicans followed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>wake,</b> and in 1520 Fre. Ambrosio, O.P., was consecrated bishop for the Dominican missions at Cranganore and Mylapur.|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that certain {{individuals}} are {{able to carry out}} prearranged tasks while lucid dreaming, and that these tasks produce physiological effects on the body similar to what is observed during waking. It was hypothesized that the difficulty of performing cerebrally lateralized tasks in a lucid dream would reflect similarities that have been observed between reported experiences of lucid dreaming and the dominant functions of the right hemisphere. Twenty-seven participants rated the difficulty of performing three analogous pairs of left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) tasks, first in a lucid dream, and later <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>waking</b> imagination. For two of the task pairs, right-handed participants found the lucid LH task harder than both the lucid RH task and the imagined LH task.

Furthermore, dream reports accounted for the discrepancy between ratings for the task pairs, confirming the right hemisphere dominance hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Ring {{waves of}} star formation, {{propagating}} outwardly in the galactic disks, leave chemical abundance gradients <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>wakes.</b> We {{show that the}} relative [Fe/O] abundance gradients in ring galaxies {{can be used as}} a tool for determining the role of the SNIa explosions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> chemical enrichment. We consider two mechanisms which can create outwardly propagating star forming rings in a purely gaseous disk — a self-induced wave and a density wave, and demonstrate that the radial distribution of the relative [Fe/O] abundance gradients does not depend on the particular mechanism of the wave formation or on the parameters of the star-forming process. We show that the [Fe/O] profile is determined by the velocity of the wave, initial mass function, and the initial chemical composition of the star-forming gas. If the role of SNIa explosions is negligible in the chemical enrichment, the ratio [Fe/O] remains constant throughout the galactic disk with a steep gradient at the wave front. If SNIa stars are important in the production of cosmic iron, the [Fe/O] ratio has gradient in the wake of the star-forming wave with the value depending on the frequency of SNIa explosions...|$|R

Unlike most of today's geologic features, {{such as the}} Grand Canyon or the likes, Padre Island changes constantly.
