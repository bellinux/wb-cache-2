5|$|Catholics live {{all over}} the world through missions, <b>diaspora,</b> and conversions. Since the 20th century the {{majority}} reside in the southern hemisphere due to secularisation of Europe, and increased persecution in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The ARF is {{considered}} the foremost organization in the Armenian <b>diaspora,</b> having established numerous Armenian schools, community centers, Scouting and athletic groups, relief societies, youth groups, camps, and other organs throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian <b>diaspora</b> in the United States {{set up a}} {{monument}} dedicated to Pavle Đurišić at the Serbian cemetery in Libertyville, Illinois. The management and players of the football club Red Star Belgrade visited it on 23 May 2010.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{accurate}} {{figures for}} the number of Sri Lankan Tamils living in the <b>diaspora.</b> Estimates range from 450,000 to one million.|$|E
5|$|Different {{variants}} {{have been}} introduced catering to regional taste and requirements. A meethi (sweet) variant of haleem is consumed as breakfast by the Arab <b>diaspora</b> in Barkas neighbourhood of the city. The chicken variant is less popular, {{even though it is}} lower priced. A vegetarian version of haleem, in which dry fruits and vegetables are substituted for goat meat, is available at some eateries in Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century {{contributed to}} the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, where a large Irish <b>diaspora</b> lives. , 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent. , a total of 34.5 million Americans claim Irish ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Etchmiadzin revived under Catholicos Vasken I {{since the}} period {{known as the}} Khrushchev Thaw in the mid-1950s, {{following}} Stalin's death. Archaeological excavations were held in 1955–56 and in 1959; the cathedral underwent a major renovation during this period. Wealthy <b>diaspora</b> benefactors, such as Calouste Gulbenkian and Alex Manoogian, financially assisted the renovation of the cathedral. Gulbenkian alone provided $400,000.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{during the}} first three years (orlah): {{according}} to , fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting cannot be consumed (both in the Land of Israel and the <b>diaspora).</b> This applies also to the fruit of the vine—grapes, and wine produced from them.|$|E
5|$|Immigrant {{communities}} in Pakistan partake in the festivities as well. The Pakistani <b>diaspora</b> {{around the world}} organises cultural events to celebrate independence day; public parades are held in cities with large Pakistani populations, such as New York, London and Dubai. In addition, Kashmiris from Jammu and Kashmir who hold pro-Pakistan sentiments are known to observe the day, causing friction with Indian authorities.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, a new technocratic {{government}} {{was elected to}} office, which enacted numerous reforms, especially in the security sector. By August 2011, the new administration and its AMISOM allies had managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Mogadishu has subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction spearheaded by the Somali <b>diaspora,</b> the municipal authorities, and Turkey, a historic ally of Somalia.|$|E
5|$|In practice, however, this {{restriction}} {{is often}} ignored {{and the two}} flags – with and without coat of arms – are treated as interchangeable. The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the Polonia, or Polish <b>diaspora</b> outside Poland, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was holding back the national aspirations of the Greek people, while the educated and dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile <b>diaspora</b> should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{took several}} {{measures}} in persecuting the Armenian Church, already {{weakened by the}} Armenian Genocide and the Russification policies of the Russian Empire. In the 1920s, the private property of the church was confiscated and priests were harassed. Soviet assaults against the Armenian Church accelerated under Stalin, beginning in 1929, but momentarily eased in the following years to improve the country's relations with the Armenian <b>diaspora.</b> In 1932, Khoren Muradpekyan became known as Khoren I and assumed the title of His Holiness the Catholicos. However, in the late 1930s, the Soviets renewed their attacks against the Church. This culminated {{in the murder of}} Khoren in 1938 as part of the Great Purge, and the closing of the Catholicosate of Echmiatsin on August 4, 1938. The Church, however, managed to survive underground and in the <b>diaspora.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ARF {{also works}} as an {{umbrella}} organ for the Armenian Relief Society, the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletic Union, the Hamazkayin Cultural Foundation, and many other community organizations. It operates the Armenian Youth Federation, which encourages the youth of the <b>diaspora</b> to join the political cause of the ARF and the Armenian people.|$|E
5|$|The mezzeh {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of appetizers, usually including hummus (sometimes topped with meat), baba ghannouj, labaneh, tabbouleh, olives and pickled vegetables. Akkawi cheese, a semi-hard cheese common throughout the Middle East and among the Arab <b>diaspora,</b> originated in the city of Akka, from which the cheese receives its name.|$|E
5|$|This {{includes}} {{baseball players}} from Puerto Rico that {{have played in}} MLB from 1942 to the present day. While {{the majority of the}} players were born on the archipelago, the list also includes players born on the mainland US to Puerto Rican parents, such as John Candelaria, Bobby Bonilla and John Valentin. Puerto Ricans typically consider the <b>diaspora</b> as their own.|$|E
5|$|Vienna {{became the}} right place for such an initiative, since it was already the most {{important}} publishing centre for the Greek <b>diaspora.</b> In 1783 the Austrian Emperor had authorized the free printing of Greek books in the city, while in 1790 the first Greek newspaper, named Ephimeris, was published there.|$|E
5|$|After {{the communists}} {{took over the}} {{short-lived}} First Republic of Armenia and ARF leaders were exiled, the Dashnaks moved their base of operations to where the Armenian <b>diaspora</b> had settled. With the large influx of Armenian refugees in the Levant, the ARF established a strong political structure in Lebanon {{and to a lesser}} extent, Syria. From 1921 to 1990, the Dashnaktsutiun established political structures in more than 200 states including the USA, where another large influx of Armenians settled.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{assertions of}} a {{distinct}} Mangalorean Catholic identity {{date from the}} migration period, a developed Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity only emerged following the captivity. The culture of Mangalorean Catholics {{is a blend of}} Mangalorean and Goan cultures. After migration, they adopted some aspects of the local Mangalorean culture, but retained many of their Goan customs and traditions, and like their Goan ancestors, modern Mangalorean Catholic culture can be best described as an increasingly Anglicised Indo-Latin culture. The Mangalorean Catholic <b>diaspora</b> is mostly concentrated in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|As Romania faced indecision {{about its}} future, the Corps {{was still the}} subject of unionist propaganda, spread by Romanian intellectuals in the capitals of Entente nations. From his {{temporary}} home in France, Bocu reestablished România Mare as the tribune of Romanian <b>diaspora</b> politics and unionist aspirations. He was joined there by Octavian Goga, who had crossed over Bolshevik territory and Finland with false papers, claiming to be a Volunteer Corps veteran.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, after Germany's capitulation, many Armenians in {{both the}} Republic, {{including}} Armenian Communist Party First Secretary Grigor Harutyunyan (Arutyunov), and the <b>diaspora</b> lobbied Stalin to reconsider the issue of taking back the provinces of Kars, Iğdır, and Ardahan, which Armenia had lost to Turkey in the Treaty of Kars. In September, 1945, the Soviet Union announced that it would annul the Soviet-Turkish treaty of friendship that was signed in 1925. Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov presented the claims put forth by the Armenians to the other Allied heads.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré <b>diaspora,</b> {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
5|$|During his Prime Ministry, Sargsyan {{helped to}} {{organize}} three major events. On 28 August 1999, the first Pan-Armenian Games began in Yerevan. Over 1,400 Armenian athletes from 23 countries {{participated in the}} games. The closing ceremony {{took place in the}} Yerevan Sports and Concerts Complex on September 5, with President Robert Kocharyan and Vazgen Sargsyan in attendance. Just after the Games, which involved thousands of <b>diaspora</b> Armenian youth, the preparations for the eighth anniversary of Armenia's independence began.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a greatly}} {{improved}} security {{situation in the}} city in 2012, many Somali expatriates began returning to Mogadishu for investment opportunities and {{to take part in}} the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. Through both private efforts and public initiatives like the Somali <b>Diaspora</b> Corps, they have participated in the renovation of schools, hospitals, banks and other infrastructure, and have played a leading role in the capital's recovery. They have also helped to propel the local real estate market.|$|E
5|$|Haleem {{originated}} as an Arabic {{dish with}} meat and pounded wheat {{as the chief}} ingredients. It was introduced to Hyderabad by the Arab <b>diaspora</b> during {{the rule of the}} sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan, and later became an integral part of Hyderabadi cuisine during the rule of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Sultan Saif Nawaz Jung Bahadur, an Arab chief from Mukalla, Hadhramaut, Yemen, who was among the seventh Nizam's court nobility, popularised it in Hyderabad. Addition of local flavours to the original recipe resulted in a taste distinct from other types of haleem.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} <b>diaspora</b> of {{artists from the}} city to all of {{northern}} Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now the hegemony of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Wałęsa {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize. Since then he has {{received}} more than 30 state decorations and more than 50 awards from 30 countries, including Order of the Bath (UK), Order of Merit (Germany), Legion of Honour (France) and European Human Rights Prize (EU 1989). In 2011, he declined to accept the Lithuanian highest order, citing his displeasure at Lithuania's policy towards the Polish <b>diaspora.</b> In 2008, he established the Lech Wałęsa Award.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Volition {{released}} the source code {{for the game}} engine under a non-commercial license. This code became {{the core of the}} FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project, which continuously improves it and enables new features. In cooperation with the FreeSpace Upgrade Project the game's graphics are kept up to date. The improved game engine is also used by various mod projects, for example The Babylon Project and <b>Diaspora</b> which are based on the science fiction series Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica respectively.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 1952, Jevđević visited Canada and {{addressed}} the Congress of the Serbian National Defense (Srpska Narodna Odbrana) in Niagara Falls regarding developments within Italy's Serb émigré community. The following year, he and Đujić issued a proclamation in Chicago declaring {{their intention to}} organize Chetnik groups against Damjanović, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jevđević later received threatening letters warning him not {{to go through with}} such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav <b>diaspora.</b> Little is known of his activities after 1953. He continued to live in Rome until his death in October 1962.|$|E
5|$|In November 1866, Levski visited Rakovski in Iaşi. Two revolutionary bands led by Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu {{had been}} inciting the Bulgarian <b>diaspora</b> {{community}} in Romania to invade Bulgaria and organise anti-Ottoman resistance. On {{the recommendation of}} Rakovski, Vasil Levski {{was selected as the}} standard-bearer of Hitov's detachment. In April 1867, the band crossed the Danube at Tutrakan, moved through the Ludogorie region and reached the Balkan Mountains. After skirmishing, the band fled to Serbia through Pirot in August.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to high-profile lawsuits against Chinese officials and corporations, Falun Gong practitioners {{have filed a}} number of complaints and civil suits alleging discrimination outside China, most of them centered within the Chinese <b>diaspora</b> community. Several complaints have been made after Falun Gong groups were barred from participating in parades or events, with mixed results. In Canada and in New York, Falun Gong practitioners won judgments against Chinese businesses or community organizations for discriminating against them {{on the basis of}} their religious creed.|$|E
5|$|In {{parliamentary}} elections, 14-member election lists may {{be submitted}} to the State Electoral Commission {{for any number of}} constituencies in Croatia. A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian <b>diaspora</b> constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported by one or more political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in Jerusalem {{as early as the}} fourth century, after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the fifth century. Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living <b>diaspora</b> community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E
5|$|Juventus are the best-supported {{football}} club in Italy, with over 12million fans or tifosi, which represent approximately 34% {{of the total}} Italian football fans according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos & Pi, {{as well as one}} of the most supported {{football club}}s in the world, with over 300million supporters (41million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of Italian <b>diaspora</b> have emigrated. The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{returned}} to Africa and took {{command of the}} RPF forces, which {{had been reduced to}} fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor. From there he re-armed and reorganized the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi <b>diaspora.</b> Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. Benefiting from the element of surprise, the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, refugee camps in nearby countries {{as well as by}} the Palestinian <b>diaspora.</b> The cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled in the region of Palestine, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Ummayad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from the coming of the Ottoman Turks. It is similar to other Levantine cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E
