Whey protein aggregation prior to homogenization is a means to modifyemulsion heat stability but the underlying mechanism of heat stabilization has hardly been studied in anindustrial context where whey protein ingredients contain caseins. Emulsions were prepared with 30 %anhydrous milk fat and 70 % whey protein/casein solutions with protein concentrations ranging from 3 to 6 %. The proteins were either unheated (WP/Cas samples) or heat-aggregated (A-WP/Cas samples). Afterhomogenization, the fat droplet interface was characterized and emulsion stability was analyzed visuallyand at microscopic level. WP/Cas emulsions were heat stable at low protein concentrations but exhibiteda gradual decrease in heat stability when the protein concentration increased (> 3 %).

There are seldom any reports on the properties of electrodeposited Ni- CeO 2 -TiO 2 composite coating.

Attempts were also made to study the effect of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the properties of the Ni-ceria-titania composite coatings. Irrespective of the current density used for electrodeposition, higher microhardness values were obtained for the coatings electrodeposited at lower current density and from a bath with higher particle loading. Similarly, higher corrosion resistance was exhibited by the coatings electrodeposited at lower current density. The incorporation of CNT in the nickel matrix along with ceria-titania composite powder increased the roughness and decreased the microhardness, wear and corrosion resistances of the coatings. However, the coefficient of friction of the coatings decreased with the incorporation of CNTs. The coatings were also characterized by X-ray diffractometry, Raman spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy. This study clearly shows that ceria-titania is a promising candidate material which {{can be used as a}} reinforcement phase in metal matrix composites for increasing the microhardness, wear and corrosion resistances of the coatings...|$|E
40|$|To study {{different}} {{formulations of}} Budesonide-containing microparticles for a colon-specific {{delivery of the}} drug to treat Crohn’s disease. Microparticles were prepared by solvent evaporation technique. The organic phase (10 %) was composed by 5 % (w/v) of polymer in methilene chloride and Budesonide 0. 05 % (w/v), while the <b>dispersing</b> <b>phase</b> was a solution of PVA 0. 1 % (w/w). Size and morphology of the obtained microparticles were analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopies. The loading efficiency of Budesonide within microparticles was determined by HPLC and DSC analyses. The “in vitro” release was performed using receiving solutions able to simulate gastric (FaSSGF) and intestinal (FaSSIF) conditions. The amount of Budesonide released was quantified by HPLC. Microparticles of Eudragit RS 100 or of Eudragit RS 100 /Eudragit RL 100 70 : 30 (w/w) were prepared. The production yields were about 92 % both in Eudragit RS 100 microparticles and Eudragit RS 100 /RL 100 particles. The mean diameters of microparticles preparations were superimposable being 24. 86 µm ± 5. 97 {{in the first case}} and 22. 86 µm ± 6. 24 in the second one. The DSC analysis confirms an interaction between the drug and the polymers. The loading efficiency of Budesonide was about 12 % in the two preparations with only few variations. The “in vitro” studies, performed both in FaSSGF and in FaSSIF solutions, showed that after 3 hours the drug release from Eudragit RS 100 /RL 100 microparticles was about six-fold higher than that obtained with monopolymer formulation (3. 56 % vs 22. 92 %). The intestinal simulating release after 6 hours was similar in both preparations (24. 45 % vs 23. 87 %). Microparticles produced with Eudragit RS 100 showed a better protection of the drug from gastric acidity than Eudragit RS 100 /RL 100 microparticles and an hypothetical system of colon specific controlled deliver...|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the aspect}} {{ratio of the}} filler {{particles}} (length/diameter) and their compatibility to the polymeric components one can achieve different morphologies: (i) filler contained within the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase,</b> (ii) within the matrix phase or (iii) at the interface between the two phases. If the fibers are sufficiently long and are preferentially wetted by the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> an effectively continuous network consisting of fibers welded together by the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> can be created. In such manner a pseudo-continuous fibrous reinforcement is spontaneously formed during the processing step and a composite material with better mechanical performance can be obtained.|$|R

The 1 –D steady-state model equations for the bubble column with water as the liquid continuous phase and air bubbles of diameter as a <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase,</b> constitutes the liquid continuity and momentum equations and the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> population balance equation and the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> momentum equation.

40|$|Dispersion of liquids {{are often}} {{encountered}} in industrial applications. For instance, plastics manufacturers frequently blend immiscible polymers to achieve desired mechanical properties. There are two problems {{central to the}} engineering of dispersions. One considers the influence of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure, or morphology, on material properties [...] in many applications, the smallest <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> morphology is best. The other addresses achieving a particular morphology. The morphology in a blend results from the interaction between a frequently complex or chaotic flow, and coalescence and breakup. The mixing is crucial, and, in some cases, {{it is possible to}} tailor a morphology with a flow. However, the modeling of this process is incomplete. Presently, no model can predict the spatial statistics of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> morphology. A further complication is that t! he <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> influences the macroscopic rheology of the blend. Einstein first demonstrated this behavior by showing that the effective viscosity of a system increased with <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> volume fraction of solids. Later, Taylor extended Einstein's results to allow for a <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> of spherical liquid droplets. Other researchers have improved upon Taylor's work, accounting for small deformations of the droplets, and shown that droplet deformation gives the dispersion an elasticity, resulting from surface tension. More recent developments in this area, allow for larger deformations, and coal escence and breakup. However, this area is relatively new with many inconsistencies in the literature. Furthermore, these newer phenomenological models contain a variety of adjustable parameters. The two inter-related goals of our work are a model for the spatial evolution of <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure, and a rheological description of liquidliquid systems. The ! former is accomplished by coupling pre-existing models of coalescence and breakup with the kinematics of mixing processes. We develop the latter by unifying the theory of the present phenomenological models for rheology, and by applying the description of the <b>dispersed</b> <b>phase</b> microstructure provided by our model to remove the adjustable parameters presently in the rheology models...|$|R
