40|$|Introduction: Quadriceps tendon {{injuries}} are rare. There {{is a limited}} number of studies in the literature, reporting partial quadriceps tendon ruptures. We did not find any study reporting an isolated vastus intermedius tendon injury in the literature. Presentation of case: A 22 years old professional rugby player with the complaints of pain in the right lower limb, decreased range of motion <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and a mass in the mid-anterior of the right thigh applied following an overloading on his hyperflexed knee during a rugby match. T 2 sequence magnetic resonance images revealed discontinuity in the vastus intermedius tendon and intramuscular hematoma. The patient has been conservatively treated. Discussion: Quadriceps tendon ruptures generally occur after the 4 th decade in the presence of degenerative changes. Our case is a young professional rugby player. Isolated vastus intermedius tendon rupture is unusual. Conservative treatment is performed as the intermedius tendon is in the deepest layer of the quadriceps muscle. Conclusion: We report the first case of isolated rupture of the vastus intermedius tendon in the literature and we claim that disorder may be succesfully treated with conservative treatment and adequate physiotheraphy...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare viable and nonviable bilabeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in arthritic joints with {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) and optical imaging (OI). MSCs were labeled with ferucarbotran and DiD. MRI and OI of bilabeled cells were compared with controls. Six rats with arthritis received intra-articular injections of bilabeled viable MSCs into the right knee and nonviable MSCs into the left knee. Animals underwent MRI and OI preinjection and at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours postinjection. The results were analyzed with a mixed random effects model and Fisher probability. Bilabeled MSCs showed increased MRI and OI signals compared to unlabeled controls (p <. 0001). After intra-articular injection, bilabeled MSCs caused significant T 2 and T 2 * effect on MRI and fluorescence on OI up to 72 hours postinjection (p <. 05). There was no significant difference between viable and nonviable MSC signal in the knee joints; however, some of the viable cells migrated to an adjacent inflamed ankle joint (p <. 05). Immunohistochemistry confirmed viable MSCs <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> and ankle joints and nonviable MSCs in the left knee. Viable and nonviable cells could not be differentiated with MRI or OI signal intensity but were differentiated based on their ability to migrate in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} disease characterized by joint pain and progressive loss of articular cartilage. Entada pursaetha has been traditionally {{used in the}} treatment of inflammatory disease, liver ailment, etc. In this study we investigated suppressive effect of ethanolic extract of E. pursaetha (EPE) on monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) -induced osteoarthritis pain and disease progression by histopathological changes in joints in a rat model. Methods: OA was induced <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> of rat by intra-articular injection of 3 mg of MIA and characterized by pathological progression of disease and pain of affected joint. Spontaneous movements, mechanical, thermal and cold sensitivity were monitored at days 0 (before drug and MIA injection), 7, 14 and 21 of MIA administration. EPE (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg), vehicle or etoricoxib (10 mg/ kg; reference drug) were administered daily for 21 days by oral route. Results: EPE at various doses significantly reduced mechanical, heat, cold hyperalgesia and increased the horizontal and vertical movements in intra-articular MIA injected rats. EPE prevented the damage to cartilage structure and reduced the cellular abnormalities. Articular cartilage of rats treated with EPE at 300 mg/kg group was almost normal with well-developed smooth surface and chondrocytes were distributed individually or arranged in column. Interpretation & conclusions: The present findings showed that the EPE was not only able to mitigate pain and hyperalgesia but also inhibited MIA-induced cartilage degeneration in vivo. EPE may have the potential to become therapeutic modality {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. However, further studies need to be done to confirm these findings in other models and clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Axial and {{peripheral}} arthropathy {{affects the}} majority of patients with acromegaly, being {{a leading cause of}} morbidity and functional disability. Treatment with octreotide (OCT) improves symptoms and signs of acromegalic arthropathy, but objective detection of structural changes in bone and cartilage has not been reported to date. This open prospective study was designed to evaluate the effect of a long term treatment with OCT on acromegalic arthropathy assessed by ultrasonography examination. Articular cartilage thicknesses of shoulder, wrist, and knee as well as sizes of heel tendons were measured in 30 acromegalic patients (18 with active and 12 with inactive disease) and 18 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy subjects. The thicknesses of shoulder, wrists and knees articular cartilages and that of heel tendons were significantly increased in patients with active acromegaly compared to those in healthy subjects (P < 0. 01). With the exception of shoulder cartilage, significant increases in wrist and knee cartilages (P < 0. 01) and right and left heel tendon sizes (P < 0. 05) were found in patients with active compared to those with inactive disease. After 6 months of OCT treatment, a significant decrease in shoulder, wrist, and left knee articular cartilage was found (P < 0. 001). No significant change was recorded <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> cartilage or heel tendon size. The decrease in thickness of shoulder and wrist cartilages was more pronounced than that measured at the level of left knee (26. 3 +/- 3. 3 % and 27. 2 +/- 4. 2 % vs. 14. 2 +/- 4. 2 %, respectively; P < 0. 05).

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{progressive}} degeneration of articular cartilage leading to failure in functional mobility of joints. It {{is characterized by}} morphological, biochemical and molecular changes in histology of cartilage. Different biological markers are used as indicators to precisely predict the stage of cartilage destruction of joints in OA patients and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of drugs used for OA. The present research was chalked out to establish relationship between disease activity and serum level of C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) in experimentally induced OA rat model. Out of 30 male Wistar rats, 25 were used to induce OA by injecting papain (10 mg/ 0. 5 mL of 0. 05 M sodium acetate) <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> joints whereas five (control) were injected with sterile normal saline solution on day 0. Blood samples (5 mL each) were collected on weekly basis up to 28 th days of post papain injection. Sera were separated and subjected to perform ELISA for estimating CTX-II fragments as cartilage biomarker (CartiLaps ® ELISA kit) in experimental groups. Maximum level of CTX–II (pg/mL) (40. 44 ± 3. 07) was observed in sera samples of day 14 post papain injection followed by days 21 (40. 22 ± 2. 01), 28 (36. 82 ± 3. 81), 7 (34. 48 ± 4. 17), 1 (15. 08 ± 4. 22) and day 0 (2. 55 ± 0. 10). The early changes in serum CTX-II from day 0 to 14 showed significant association with cartilage damage. Later on, no significant difference was observed in CTX-II level on day 14, 21 and 28 post papain injection. It is concluded that elevation in serum CTX-II level was concomitant {{with the onset of}} disease and degradation of cartilage. Moreover, CTX-II is a sensitive diagnostic biomarker to monitor joint disorder severity in papain induced OA rat experimental model on different days. These findings may be used as base line for early diagnosis of disease and initiation of therapy for successful outcome. ...|$|E
40|$|A Síndrome Pós-Pólio (SPP) caracteriza-se por um novo episódio de fraqueza muscular e/ou fadiga muscular anormal em indivíduos que apresentaram poliomielite {{anterior}} aguda (PAA) anos antes. Ainda são poucos os relatos na literatura sobre o gerenciamento da dor na SSP. O objetivo deste trabalho é analisar o controle da dor na síndrome pós-pólio por meio de um relato de caso. Um homem de 57 anos com SPP foi submetido a 24 sessões de fisioterapia para controle do quadro álgico na síndrome, baseada em recursos eletrotermofototerápicos e cinesioterapia. Para análise da dor pré e pós-intervenção fisioterapêutica foram aplicados dois instrumentos: a Escala Analógica Visual (EVA) e a Intensidade de Dor Presente (ID). O quadro álgico no joelho direito sofreu redução de grau 8 para 4 pela EVA e grau 5 para 2 pela ID, enquanto a dor no tornozelo direito reduziu de grau 2 pela EVA e grau 1 pela ID para zero em ambas as escalas. A dor é apontada como um sintoma predominante por muitos pacientes com SPP. O sujeito deste relato, após o programa de tratamento, apresentou melhora expressiva da dor. Entretanto, devido à escassez da literatura sobre dados substanciais referentes ao seu gerenciamento, especialmente na fisioterapia, novos estudos devem ser propostos para gerar maior fundamentação teórica à abordagem fisioterapêutica na SPP.

40|$|Artrite Ã uma doenÃa inflamatÃria que afeta as articulaÃÃes sinoviais. Os sintomas mais comuns sÃo o aumento da sensibilidade Ã dor nas articulaÃÃes (hiperalgesia ou hipernocicepÃÃo) e edema. Uma alternativa para o tratamento da doenÃa Ã a inclusÃo de plantas {{medicina}}is. O Ãleo extraÃdo dos frutos do pequi (Caryocar coriaceum Wittm), tem ampla aplicabilidade na medicina popular. Ensaios prÃ-clÃnicos demonstraram propriedades terapÃuticas do Ãleo, tais como anti-inflamatÃria, gastroprotetora e cicatrizante. Com base neste contexto, o objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar a atividade antinociceptiva e anti-inflamatÃria do Ãleo de pequi (OPCC) na artrite induzida por zymosan em ratos. O estudo foi aprovado pela ComissÃo de Ãtica em Pesquisa Animal da Universidade Federal do CearÃ (nÂ 83 / 11). A artrite foi induzida por uma injeÃÃo intrarticular, no joelho direito, de zymosan (1 mg/ 50 ÂL) e foram avaliados a incapacitaÃÃo articular (hipernocicepÃÃo), edema articular, migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos, liberaÃÃo de citocinas e expressÃo de mediadores inflamatÃrios. Os animais foram prÃ-tratados, por via oral, com OPCC (100, 200 e 400 mg/kg) ou veÃculo durante 7 dias consecutivos ou em dose Ãnica, 45 minutos, antes da induÃÃo de artrite. Dexametasona, indometacina ou dipirona foram utilizadas como controles positivos. A incapacitaÃÃo articular foi avaliada durante 4 horas apÃs a injeÃÃo de zymosan. Em seguida os animais foram eutanasiados, procedendo-se a lavagem da cavidade articular com EDTA em PBS para avaliaÃÃo de infiltraÃÃo de leucÃcitos, atividade de mieloperoxidase e dosagem de citocinas. O tecido sinovial foi colhido para anÃlise imunohistoquimica de TNF-&# 945; e COX- 2. TambÃm foram avaliados o edema (diÃmetro transversal da articulaÃÃo) e o aumento da permeabilidade vascular pelo mÃtodo de extravasamento do Azul de Evans. O efeito antinociceptivo foi avaliado ainda atravÃs do teste de hiperalgesia mecÃnica plantar (Von Frey eletrÃnico) utilizando carraginia e PGE 2. Os resultados demonstraram uma diminuiÃÃo significativa (p< 0, 05) da incapacitaÃÃo articular de todos os grupos tratados com OPCC durante 7 dias, no entanto com a dose Ãnica apenas as doses maiores foram eficazes. Em relaÃÃo Ã migraÃÃo de leucÃcitos para o lÃquido sinovial todos os grupos tratados com o OPCC (dose Ãnica e doses diÃrias) apresentaram significativa reduÃÃo (p< 0, 05) do nÃmero de leucÃcitos no lavado articular, acompanhada de uma diminuiÃÃo (p< 0, 05) na atividade da mieloperoxidase. Observou-se uma diminuiÃÃo (p< 0, 05) da liberaÃÃo de citocinas (TNF-&# 945; e IL- 1 &# 946;) no lÃquido sinovial, assim como expressÃo de TNF&# 945; e COX- 2 no tecido sinovial. O edema foi inibido (p< 0, 05) com o tratamento com OPCC em todas as doses administradas diariamente. AlÃm disso, os grupos tratados com 100 e 400 mg/kg de OPCC apresentaram uma reduÃÃo significativa (p< 0, 05) da permeabilidade vascular. Os resultados mostraram ainda que a OPCC reduziu significativamente (p < 0, 05) a hipernocicepÃÃo induzida pela carragenina e PGE 2. Os dados sugerem que o OPCC exibe efeito anti-inflamatÃrio evidenciado pelo modelo de artrite induzida por zymosan em ratos, que pode ser associada com a inibiÃÃo da produÃÃo de citocinas prÃ-inflamatÃrias (TNF-&# 945; e IL- 1 &# 946;). Aparentemente essa aÃÃo pode estar envolvida com a inibiÃÃo da migraÃÃo de neutrÃfilos. Sugerimos ainda que o OPCC previne o desenvolvimento da hipernocicepÃÃo inflamatÃria mecÃnica evocada por carragenina e PGE 2 (bloqueio direto da hipernocicepÃÃo) em ratos. Arthritis is {{an inflammatory}} disease that affects synovial joints. The most common symptoms are increased sensitivity to joint pain (hyperalgesia or hypernociception) and edema. An alternative to treating {{the disease is}} the inclusion of medicinal plants. The oil extracted from the fruits of Pequi (Caryocar coriaceum Wittm) has wide applicability in popular medicine. Pre-clinical tests have demonstrated the therapeutic properties of the oil, such as anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and healing. Based on this background, {{the objective of this}} study was to investigate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory oil Pequi (OPCC) in zymosan-induced arthritis in rats. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of the Federal University of CearÃ (nÂ 83 / 11). Arthritis was induced by intraarticular injection <b>in</b> <b>right</b> <b>knee</b> of zymosan (1 mg/ 50 ÂL) and evaluated the articular incapacitation (hypernociception), joint swelling, leukocyte migration, cytokine release and expression of inflammatory mediators. The animals were pretreated orally with OPCC (100, 200 e 400 mg/kg) or carrier for 7 consecutive days either as a single dose 45 minutes before the induction of arthritis. Dexamethasone, indomethacin or dipyrone were used as positive controls. The articular incapacitation was assessed 4 hours after injection of zymosan. Then the animals were euthanized, proceeding to wash the joint cavity EDTA in PBS for evaluation of leukocyte infiltration, myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine. The tissue synovial fluid was harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of TNF-&# 945; and COX- 2. We also evaluated edema (transverse diameter of the joint) and increased vascular permeability by the method of Evans blue extravasation. The antinociceptive effect was evaluated further by testing plant mechanical hyperalgesia (von Frey electronic). The results showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 05) joint of disability in all groups treated with OPCC for 7 days, but with only a single dose, higher doses were effective. Compared to the migration of leukocytes into the synovial fluid all groups treated with the OPCC (single dose and daily doses) showed a significant reduction p < 0. 05) in the number of leukocytes in the BAL joints, accompanied by a decrease (p < 0. 05) in myeloperoxidase activity. There was a decrease (p < 0. 05) cytokine release (TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;) in the synovial fluid as well as expression of TNF and COX- 2 in synovial tissue. The edema was inhibited (p < 0. 05) treatment with all doses in OPCC. Moreover, the groups treated with 100 and 400 mg/kg of OPCC showed a significant reduction (p < 0. 05) in vascular permeability. The results also showed that the OPCC significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) hypernociception and PGE 2 induced by carrageenan. The data suggest that the OPCC exhibits anti-inflammatory effect evidenced by arthritis model in rats induced by zymosan, which can be associated with the inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&# 945; and IL- 1 &# 946;). Apparently this action may be involved in the inhibition of neutrophil migration. We also suggest that the OPCC hypernociception prevents the development of carragenan-evoked inflammatory mechanical and PGE 2 (direct blockade of hypernociception) in rats...|$|E
