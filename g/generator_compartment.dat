2500|$|All cars' toilets were removed. There were {{originally}} nine five-car and three four-car sets. The first sets to enter service had the locomotive {{at the north}} end, but later ones were marshalled with the locomotive at the south end; the earlier sets were then turned on the triangle at Limerick Junction to standardise the position. However, the number of available driving trailers declined due to a spate of fires (at one stage, a [...] "spare man" [...] travelled in each driving trailer's <b>generator</b> <b>compartment</b> to detect and extinguish fires) and the fatal collision at Gormanston in 1974. There were only six driving trailers available by 1982; conventional locomotive haulage was, thus, often substituted for push–pull operation.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward <b>generator</b> <b>{{compartments}},</b> which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|R
5000|$|On July 23, 2015, V.C. Summer Unit 2 {{reached a}} {{landmark}} milestone with the successful {{placement of the}} CA-01 module, one of the largest, heaviest, and most complicated modules within the Nuclear Island, {{also referred to as}} a super module because it was so large that huge submodules had to be shipped from the manufacturer and final assembly was completed on site in the twelve-story Module Assembly Building. Installation of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It is the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam <b>Generator</b> <b>compartments,</b> Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds. Because of how much it weighs, lifting and placing the CA-01 module into the Unit 2 Nuclear Island resulted in the heaviest lift for the V.C. Summer construction project to date.|$|R

5000|$|A {{consideration}} when rebuilding an SDP40 is {{that the}} rear corner steps do not comply with current Federal Regulations.

40|$|Objectives The {{composition}} of thermal degradation products from {{two types of}} polyurethane foams, one based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) {{and the other on}} diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), was analyzed and their toxic lung effects were compared. Methods Isolated perfused lungs of guinea pig were subjected to thermal decomposition products of polyurethane foams from an aerosol <b>generator</b> with <b>compartments</b> for diluting, mixing, and sampling. Results Thermal degradation of MDI-based polyurethane foams released MDI, phenyl isocyanate, and methyl isocyanate. The emitted particulate fraction was 75 % for MDI, whereas that for TDI from TDI-based polyurethane foam was 3 %. Thermal degradation products from MDI-based foam caused a pronounced dose-dependent decrease in the measured lung function parameters (conductance and compliance). In contrast, the thermal degradation products from TDI-based foam did not cause any decrease in lung function. Conclusions Thermal degradation products generated from MDI-based polyurethane foam were more toxic to the lung than those generated from TDI-based polyurethane foam. This difference was probable due to MDI in the particle phase...|$|R
2500|$|T-55 (Ob'yekt 155) - Produced 1958–1963, in Poland 1958–1964, in Czechoslovakia from 1958 to 1983. It {{has a new}} turret with floor, PAZ nuclear-blast {{protection}} and over-pressure NBC system, gamma ray detector, improved V-55 engine developing [...] (the engine output was boosted by increasing both pressure of injected fuel and degree of compression) and power-assisted clutch, MC-1 internal oil filter, AK-150S compressor which allows pneumatic start of the engine (the electric starter was removed), new internal fuel tanks with a capacity of 300 l situated {{in the front of}} the hull (this increased the overall capacity of the internal fuel tanks to 680 l), ammunition load for the main gun was increased from 34 rounds to 43 (18 of which are stored in [...] "wet containers" [...] situated inside the hull fuel tanks), [...] "Rosa" [...] fire-protection system and TDA exhaust smoke <b>generator.</b> The engine <b>compartment</b> was equipped with a heating system. To compensate for the increase in mass caused by the new equipment the rear hull armour was thinned. The loader's DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun was removed. The T-55 also lacks a turret dome ventilator. Early units had flush loader's hatch. [...] "Starfish" [...] road wheels replaced earlier [...] "spider" [...] style. Also a snorkel can be placed on T-55 (unlike its predecessors) to allow it to cross 5.5 m depths at a speed of [...] (without preparation T-55 can cross 1.4 m depths). This equipment takes about 30 minutes' preparation, but can be jettisoned immediately on leaving the water.|$|R

50|$|Presence {{of water}} in {{hydrogen}} has to be avoided, as it causes deterioration to hydrogen cooling properties, corrosion of the generator parts, arcing in the high voltage windings, and reduces the lifetime of the generator. A desiccant-based dryer is usually included in the gas circulation loop, typically with a moisture probe in the dryer's outlet, sometimes also in its inlet. Presence of moisture is also an indirect evidence for air leaking into the <b>generator</b> <b>compartment.</b> Another option is optimizing the hydrogen scavenging, so the dew point is kept within the generator manufacturer specifications. The water is usually introduced into the generator atmosphere as an impurity in the turbine oil; another route is via leaks in water cooling systems.|$|E

50|$|Although SAL {{successfully}} used the SDP35 in high-speed passenger service {{as well as}} on expedited freight and piggyback trains, Union Pacific found it unsuitable and relegated its entire fleet to freight service while its famous yellow E-units continued to handle passengers. With the July 1, 1967 Seaboard Coast Line merger, SAL units received passenger numbers 601-620 and also served SCL in both high-speed freight service and on passenger trains. With the arrival of Amtrak, SCL renumbered them into the freight series and numbers 1951-1970. Later in their SCL years, they were renumbered again and assigned into the heavy yard duty and assigned 4500-series numbers. ACL's lone unit was renumbered 1099 when the line acquired former MKT E8s. At the SCL merger, it was assigned number 600 and then later received SCL number 1950.Louisville & Nashvilles four SDP35s, (1700-1703) ordered in spring 1964 to replace ageing E and F units in passenger service were completed and delivered without steam generation equipment installed, after approval of several passenger train cancellations from Government regulatory Agencies were approved during the locomotives assembly, leaving L&N with a surplus of passenger locomotives. After delivery L&N assigned the SDP35s to general freight service, installing radio control locomotive equipment in the steam <b>generator</b> <b>compartment,</b> and using the engines in locotrol service until 1969.In 1966, when the EMD 645 prime mover superseded the EMD 567, the SDP35 was replaced in EMD's catalog by the EMD SDP40.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian inner {{hair cells}} transduce the sound waves amplified by the {{cochlear}} amplifier (CA) into a graded neurotransmitter release that activates channels on auditory nerve fibers (ANF). These synaptic channels then charge its dendritic spike generator. While the outer hair {{cells of the}} CA employ positive feedback, poising on Andronov-Hopf type instabilities which make them extremely sensitive to faint sounds and make CA output strongly nonlinear, the ANF appears {{to be based on}} different principles and a different type of dynamical instability. Its spike generator "digitizes" CA output into trains of action potentials and behaves as a linear filter, rate-coding sound intensity across a wide dynamic range. Here we model the spike generator as a 3 dimensional version of a saddle node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation. The generic 2 d SNIC increases its spike rate as the square root of the input current above its spiking threshold. We add negative feedback {{in the form of a}} low voltage-threshold potassium conductance that slows down the generator's rate of increase of its spike rate. A Poisson random source simulates an inner hair cell, outputting a series of noisy periodic current pulses to the model ANF whose spikes phase lock to these pulses and have a linear frequency to current relation with a wide dynamic range. Also, the spike <b>generator</b> <b>compartment</b> has a cholinergic feedback connection from the olive and experiments show that such feedback is able to alter the amount of H conductance inside the <b>generator</b> <b>compartment.</b> We show that an olive able to decrease H would be able to shift the spike generator's dynamic range to higher sound intensities. In a quiet environment by increasing H the olive would be able to make spike trains similar to those caused by synaptic input...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{auditory}} nerve fibers (ANF) are remarkable {{for being able}} to encode a 40 dB, or hundred fold, range of sound pressure levels into their firing rate. Most of the fibers are very sensitive and raise their quiescent spike rate by a small amount for a faint sound at auditory threshold. Then as the sound intensity is increased, they slowly increase their spike rate, with some fibers going up as high as ∼ 300 Hz. In this way mammals are able to combine sensitivity and wide dynamic range. They are also able to discern sounds embedded within background noise. ANF receive efferent feedback, which suggests that the fibers are readjusted according to the background noise in order to maximize the information content of their auditory spike trains. Inner hair cells activate currents in the unmyelinated distal dendrites of ANF where sound intensity is rate-coded into action potentials. We model this spike <b>generator</b> <b>compartment</b> as an attenuator that employs fast negative feedback. Input current induces rapid and proportional leak currents. This way ANF are able to have a linear frequency to input current (f-I) curve that has a wide dynamic range. The ANF spike generator remains very sensitive to threshold currents, but efferent feedback is able to lower its gain in response to noise...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{accumulation}} in {{the containment}} compartments under severe accidents {{would result in}} high concentration, {{which could lead to}} hydrogen deflagration or detonation. Therefore, getting detailed hydrogen flow and distribution is a key issue to arrange hydrogen removal equipment in the containment compartments. In this study, hydrogen flow behavior in local compartments has been investigated in two horizontal compartments. The analysis model is built by 3 -dimensional CFD code in Cartesian coordinates based on the connection structure of the Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) compartments. It consists of two cylindrical vessels, representing the Steam <b>Generator</b> <b>compartment</b> (SG) and Core Makeup Tank compartment (CMT). With standard k-ε turbulence model, the effects of the connecting pipe size and location on hydrogen concentration distribution are investigated. Results show that increasing the diameter of connection pipe (IP) which is located at 800 [*]mm from 150 [*]mm to 300 [*]mm facilitates hydrogen flow between compartments. Decreasing the length of IP which is located at 800 [*]mm from 1000 [*]mm to 500 [*]mm can also facilitate hydrogen flow between compartments. Lower IP is in favor of hydrogen mixing with air in non-source compartment. Higher IP is helpful for hydrogen flow to the non-source term compartment from source term compartment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of steel plate reinforced concrete (SC) walls of nuclear power plant steam generator compartments subjected to simultaneous combination of thermal and mechanical loads. Two different types of wall designs were studied and compared. These included: (1) a conventional design that is currently in use in industry, and (2) an alternative Bechtel proprietary design. The conventional design consisted of a steel/concrete/steel sandwich with composite action developed with shear studs. The Bechtel proprietary design replaced the shear studs with pre-tensioned rods that provided composite action and acted as form ties during concrete casting. ^ The experimental program was designed to determine the thermal and structural behavior of beam segments of steam <b>generator</b> <b>compartment</b> walls subjected to a postulated plant accident consisting of: (1) an approximate uniform fluid/gas pressure of 10 psi, and (2) heating of the interior surface to 300 º F for a two hour duration. The beam specimens represented one-way sub-section strips from the corresponding wall modules. Two full-scale beam specimens of each wall design were tested. The beam specimens were subjected to structural loading using a four-point loading configuration, which served to replicate {{the effects of a}} 10 psi uniform pressure. The loaded specimens were heated to 300 º F using electric radiant heaters. After two hours of heating, the applied structural loading was increased to 360 % of the initial value. The experimental results indicate that both types of wall designs, namely the conventional and Bechtel proprietary designs demonstrated satisfactory performance with minimal loss of stiffness and no evidence of ultimate failure under the initial load or the subsequent overload. ^ Fiber-based analytical models were developed and validated to predict {{the behavior of}} the beam specimens. The validated models were used to develop simple design equations for calculating the: (1) stiffness, (2) strength, and (3) stresses produced in SC beam specimens with different boundary conditions subjected to combined thermal and mechanical loading. ...|$|E
