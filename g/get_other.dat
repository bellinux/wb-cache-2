But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could <b>get</b> <b>other</b> than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school’s manual labor program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than half what male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E

Though {{she had been a}} professional writer for almost two decades, Scott and Bailey marked the first instance of Bullmore writing and starring in the same production. Due to Wainwright's increased workload on her other drama series' Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley, Bullmore was chosen to be the head writer for Scott and Baileys fourth series in 2014.

500|$|Hay's {{involvement}} in the efforts to have a canal joining the oceans in Central America {{went back to his}} time as Assistant Secretary of State under Hayes, when he served as translator for Ferdinand de Lesseps in his efforts to interest the American government in investing in his canal company. [...] President Hayes was only interested in the idea of a canal under American control, which de Lesseps's project would not be. By the time Hay became Secretary of State, de Lesseps's project in Panama (then a Colombian province) had collapsed, as had an American-run project in Nicaragua. The 1850 Clayton-Bulwer Treaty (between the United States and Britain) forbade the United States from building a Central American canal that it exclusively controlled, and Hay, from early in his tenure, sought the removal of this restriction. [...] But the Canadians, for whose foreign policy Britain was still available, saw the canal matter as their greatest leverage to <b>get</b> <b>other</b> disputes resolved in their favor, persuaded Salisbury not to resolve it independently. [...] Shortly before Hay took office, Britain and the U.S. agreed to establish a Joint High Commission to adjudicate unsettled matters, which met in late 1898 but made slow progress, especially on the Canada-Alaska boundary.|$|E
500|$|However, as {{the season}} progressed, head coach Seth Greenberg began giving Garland fewer minutes. Following the {{recovery}} of freshman Marquis Rankin from a torn meniscus, Garland played a total of one minute in three games. He also scored a combined six points following his initial two performances that season. On December 11, 2011, Garland did not even remove his warm-up shirt in his team's game vs Norfolk State. When Greenberg was asked about Garland's playing time, the coach said, [...] "Marquis [...] is right now a good play-starter and good on ball defender. We've got to <b>get</b> <b>other</b> guys more minutes". When asked a similar question the day before, he said that [...] "you can't play 13 guys". On December 16, 2011, Garland announced on Twitter that {{he was planning to}} transfer out of Virginia Tech. Following his exams, he returned to his hometown of Philadelphia. Garland became the third men's basketball player to transfer out of the Hokies' team in the past academic year, following the footsteps of Ben Boggs, who moved to Valparaiso, and Manny Atkins, who would end up with Georgia State. Garland finished his sophomore year at Virginia Tech averaging 4.6 points, 1.3 assists, and 1.3 turnovers in eight appearances. In late December 2011, he began competing for La Salle. Explorers head coach John Giannini said, [...] "We recruited Tyrone extremely hard out of high school. He is known as a scorer and can also be a very good passer and defender. He is the type of all-around guard, talent and person that will make our team better. He gives us an experienced player to continue our growth over the next 2 years. With his addition we will have tremendous team quickness and depth." [...] Several of the team's top scorers in 2011–12 had experience playing high school basketball in the Philadelphia Public and Catholic Leagues.|$|E
500|$|Mani Ratnam {{developed}} a script—originally written in English—into a film and named it Pallavi Anu Pallavi. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed {{to produce the}} film but imposed a condition {{that it should be}} made under a limited budget in Kannada, to which he agreed. As a debutant, Mani Rahman {{wanted to make sure that}} the technical aspects of the film are good. He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter's work to be very impressive. He managed to <b>get</b> <b>other</b> crew members B. Lenin (for editing), Thotta Tharani (for art direction) and Ilaiyaraaja (for music composer music), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then. For the male lead, he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Lakshmi who was a leading actress then, was signed up as the female lead. The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983. After watching Pallavi Anu Pallavi, N. G. John, a Malayalam film producer, offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by T. Damodaran, Unaru was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala. The film was completed with in two months and got released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had. Following this, he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct Pagal Nilavu (1985). The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles. It was different from his previous two films in a way that it included dance sequences and a [...] "comedy track". However, the film turned out to be another failure for him. The same year, he directed another Tamil film Idaya Kovil, a romantic drama. He remodeled a ready made script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952). Described by himself as an unsatisfied work, the film was a major box-office success. The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only Pallavi Anupallavi being a satisfiable film; the rest three were done with a lot of [...] "compromises".|$|E
