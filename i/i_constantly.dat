500|$|A {{teenager}} {{struggling to}} find his place in life ever since his parents disappeared {{when he was a}} child. A spider bites him {{on the back of his}} neck, giving him spider-powers. He becomes Spider-Man. Garfield described Parker as someone he can relate to and stated that the character had been an important influence on him since he was little. [...] Garfield drew from his life experiences as inspiration for the role, revealing, [...] "I was thinking of my history and thinking of the kid at school who I wasn't as strong as, who behaved badly to a lot of people– including myself– and who <b>I</b> <b>constantly</b> tried to stand up to but never had the physical prowess to". Discussing his predecessor, Garfield said he respects Tobey Maguire as an actor and that when he first saw Maguire play Spider-Man he [...] "was blown away by his interpretation." [...] Garfield said in interviews, including one in which he was interviewed by Maguire, that when he watched the film Spider-Man when he was younger, he would jokingly recite Maguire's lines in the mirror with a friend who joked that he would never be Spider-Man. On accepting the role Garfield explained, [...] "I see it as a massive challenge in many ways... To make it authentic. To make the character live and breathe in a new way. The audience already has a relationship with many different incarnations of the character. I do, as well. I'm probably going to be the guy in the movie theater shouting abuse at myself. But I have to let that go. No turning back. And I wouldn't want to." [...] After taking the role, Garfield studied the movements of athletes and spiders and tried to incorporate them, saying Parker is [...] "a boy/spider in terms of how he moves, and not just in the suit." [...] He did yoga and Pilates for the role in order to be as flexible as possible. When first wearing his costume Garfield admitted to shedding tears and trying to imagine [...] "a better actor in the suit", which he described as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] and admitted to wearing nothing beneath it since it is skintight. When filming Garfield explained that he had four months of training and described his physical roles on stunts as terribly challenging and exhausting.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why <b>I</b> <b>constantly</b> want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
2500|$|When Toole toured Australia in 1890, Vanbrugh was {{a member}} of his company, acting in every play in its repertoire. She later commented, [...] "I think this was even better {{training}} than Miss Thorne's school; not only was <b>I</b> <b>constantly</b> playing a new part, but I was constantly playing to a different type of audience. We visited all sorts of Australian cities, large and small, and one was pretty certain before long to find out the weak points in one's method." [...] On her return, she remained with Toole's company, and played her first original roles as Thea Tesman in James Barrie's, burlesque Ibsen's Ghost (1891), and as Bell Golightly in Barrie's Walker, London (1892).|$|E

Colette. The best are the writers {{that can turn}} a phrase devastatingly funny. The witticisms and bon mots of Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Dorothy Parker. Andy Warhol was a riot. That's probably why I have captions in my paintings. I want the women in my paintings to speak." ...|$|R

60|$|Religion {{is still}} very strong. I went into many churches, where I saw {{obviously}} famished priests in gorgeous vestments, and a congregation enormously devout.

60|$|Like all {{the natives}} of Tibet and Sikkim, the priests are intolerably filthy; {{in some cases}} so far {{carrying}} out their doctrines as not even to kill the vermin with which they swarm.

6000|$|... "You must lose {{no time in}} {{committing}} it to paper, young man," [...] said Bardo, {{with growing}} interest.
