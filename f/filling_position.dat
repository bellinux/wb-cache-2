40|$|This study {{addressed}} how hospital Registered Nurses {{experienced the}} unexpected departure of their Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) and the succession events that followed. The human resource interventions {{that were used}} and projected as meaningful to restore equilibrium were uncovered. ^ A naturalistic inquiry was conducted. The nurse participants were purposefully selected from management, coordinating, and clinical practice roles. Semi-structured tape recorded interviews, field notes, and artifacts {{were used in the}} analysis which revealed 38 themes clustered into six reporting categories. ^ The data confirmed that nurses at all levels experienced various emotions over the CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure, with those hierarchically situated the closest to the CNO experiencing the most intense loss. The duration of emotional responses ranged from several days to two months. Some staff experienced apathy and diminished work output. Patient care was indirectly affected due to extra time spent in shift report and at the nurses 2 ̆ 7 station discussing rumors, and by management and staff resignations that were partially attributed to the CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure. The CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure symbolized a downward spiral for the organization, resulting in employee job insecurity. ^ The importance of the search for a successor was validated. The search marked an opportunity for staff to project future hopes for the nursing division and served to solidify for nurses the attributes they desired in a CNO. The search became tainted when the CEO projected support of an internal candidate before the legitimate search was conducted. In a change-driven environment, an internal candidate may have an edge over outside applicants in gaining the appointment. ^ Human resource interventions restore a destabilized nursing division, however few formal strategies were implemented beyond rumor control and initial staff communication. Recommended interventions were classified into four strategic areas: communication, transition, search process and candidate authentication, and CNO stabilization. ^ The replacement CNO faces a formidable task of taking charge by honoring staff emotions, establishing nursing division priorities, <b>filling</b> <b>position</b> vacancies, and promoting a future vision. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} optimization of {{die temperature}} in high pressure die-casting (HPDC) of A 380 alloy by experimental observation and numerical simulation {{with the use}} of statistical tools. The goal of this research is to determine the optimum die temperature to minimize incidence of these defects and thus maximize production of parts without defects.    In HPDC, molten metal is injected into the die at high speed (40 - 60 m/s for aluminum alloys). Die temperature plays an important role on the rate of rejected parts. Therefore, flow patterns of molten metal in HPDC of an automotive component with very complex geometry (the ladder frame from the EF 7 motor) were examined to determine the optimal die temperature. Defects in the production process fall into three categories, including surface, internal and dimensional defects. Samples produced in the experiments were classified according to any present defects. Another important parameter that influences casting defects is the cooling rate. Die temperatures were measured at the initial step and final filling positions. Experiments were performed with die temperatures ranging from 150 °C to 250 °C. The results show that the melt temperature difference in the die between the initial step and the final <b>filling</b> <b>position</b> was between 20 and 25 °C. Statistical tools such as regressions, relationships, max, min, correlations, ANOVA, T-test, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and descriptive statistics were used to facilitate interpretation of data from the die-cast experiments. Perform some case studies in order to study the process behavior, take a better knowledge of effective parameters, and measure the required parameters. The collected data are utilized to: Set the model Validate/ verify the model ProCast software was used to simulate the fluid flow and solidification step, and the results were verified by experimental measurements. The optimal die temperature for this alloy was found to be above 200 oC. Statistical analysis of the experimental results found that defects were minimized and confirmed parts were maximized in HPDC of the ladder frame within a die temperature range of 210 ° C to 215 ° C...|$|E
40|$|When agrochemicals are used, {{there is}} a risk for polluting soil and water, {{expressed}} as diffuse pollution and pollution through point sources. Point sources are normally related to handling and storage of pesticides and operations such as filling, cleaning, etc. This aspect has not earlier been studied for the greenhouse industry, in spite {{the fact that many of}} given advice and methods for field agriculture are hardly possible to imply in greenhouse production. The objective of this project has been, through case studies, to investigate and collect information on real life handling of chemicals, in order to survey high risk operations and need for improvements. The term ‘handling’ covers all operations, except spraying. The case studies covered 18 pot plant producers, where operations were documented and spray operators were interviewed. The study shows snapshots from these operations and must not be generalised to Swedish pot plant production as a whole. The study showed differences between companies and in many cases space for improvement. The result of the project could be summarised in the following points: • Storing of chemicals was satisfactory, but the location of the storage room implied unsafe transports within the greenhouse complex • Measuring of pesticides were made at places, where a possible spill would cause pollution of soil and water • Filling of sprayers were made at places, where a possible spill would cause pollution of soil and water • Some companies had established biobeds or closed tanks, which considerable reduced the risks in mixing, filling and cleaning • Cleaning of sprayers was a rare operation • The most obvious reduction of risks would be obtained if the chemical storage was moved close to the <b>filling</b> <b>position</b> and the filling site was hard surfaced with a drain pipe connected to a biobed or closed tank • Use of equipment for personal protection made work operations difficult and complicated, thus giving lower priority to personal protection. Improvements seemed possible. The original objectives of the project were, besides the documentation, to develop safe and appropriate systems (a suitable combination of technical equipment, structural components, working routines, etc), corresponding to what we find in field agriculture, but suitable for the conditions of greenhouse production. As the project only was financed partly, the later part has been reduced, giving the suggestions a character of preliminary sketches. A continuation of the project has been applied for. The project has been financed by LRF Konsult, Malmö, Partnership Alnarp and by the Swedish Board of Agriculture. The results will be distributed to greenhouse growers, mainly through cooperation with advisers and at spray operator license courses...|$|E
