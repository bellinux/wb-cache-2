40|$|Abstract – A {{majority}} of server {{applications such as}} web server, database, E-mail, storage, etc. process a lot of network data, making them very network I/O intensive. TCP/IP is {{the most commonly used}} network protocol by these applications. TCP/IP runs over Ethernet, which is the de-facto Local Area Network (LAN) protocol. Rapid growth of Internet-enabled applications has resulted in development of <b>faster</b> <b>Ethernet</b> network technologies (from 100 Mbps to 1 and 10 Gbps). This sudden jump in Ethernet speeds necessitates TCP/IP processing to scale proportionately so that the server applications can ultimately benefit. This {{turns out to be a}} big challenge for server platforms, given that the CPU and memory speeds improve at a slower rate (tracking Moore’s law). Work done in the past has shown that TCP/IP processing, especially the receive side, is very memory intensive and therefore limits achievable network throughput considerably. To understand this, we have done a thorough cache characterization of TCP/IP processing. Results from this work have pointed out that only a small fraction of TCP/IP data (TCB and hash nodes) exhibits temporal locality, while the majority (descriptors, protocol headers, and payload) exhibits no temporal locality and thus generates a lot of memory accesses. To address these issues, we use two caching techniques in this paper: (1) Cache Region Locking (CRL) with Automatic-Actions, and (2) Cache Region Prefetching (CRP). We describe these techniques and analyze their performance benefits. To measure performance benefits, we implemented these caching techniques in an execution-driven CPU simulator and applied these to a Free BSD TCP/IP stack. Our simulation results show that the proposed caching techniques improve TCP/IP performance up to 65 % by reducing the memory stall time. ...|$|R
50|$|Indirect {{rendering}} can {{be shown}} to perform well if the network is sufficiently <b>fast</b> (Gigabit <b>Ethernet,</b> for instance), if the application does not dynamically modify the geometry of the object being rendered, if the application uses display lists, and if the application does not use {{a great deal of}} texture mapping. Many OpenGL applications, however, do not meet these criteria. To further complicate matters, some OpenGL extensions do not work in an indirect rendering environment. Some of these extensions require the ability to directly access the 3D graphics hardware and thus can never be made to work indirectly. In other cases, the user's X display may not provide explicit support for a needed OpenGL extension, or the extension may rely on a specific hardware configuration that is not present on the user's desktop machine.|$|R
40|$|Networks of {{workstations}} (NOWs) offer a {{cost effective}} platform for high-performance, long-running parallel computations. However, these computations {{must be able}} to tolerate the changing and often faulty nature of NOW environments. We present high-performance implementations of several fault-tolerant algorithms for distributed scientific computing. The fault-tolerance is based on diskless checkpointing, a paradigm that uses processor redundancy rather than stable storage as the fault-tolerant medium. These algorithms are able to run on clusters of workstations that change over time due to failure, load or availability. As long as there are at least n processors in the cluster, and failures occur singly, the computation will complete in an efficient manner. We discuss the details of how the algorithms are tuned for fault-tolerance and present the performance results on a PVM network of Sun workstations connected by a <b>fast,</b> switched <b>ethernet...</b>|$|R
