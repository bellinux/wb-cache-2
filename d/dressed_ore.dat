This methodology has been used to study alterite iron <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> activities and remains in the Jura Mountains and its margins: the Sa√¥ne Valley.

50|$|Vanning {{is a type}} of <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> {{by which}} <b>ores</b> are washed on a shovel.Typically, a {{powdered}} sample of orestuff is swirled with water on the blade of a shovel and then given a series of upward flicking motions. The heavier ore is tossed up through the water and appears as a crescent shaped patch {{at the top of the}} charge with the lighter gangue below.

40|$|The {{concentration}} and mobility {{spatial distribution of}} heavy metals (lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium) including potential ecological risk have been evaluated for the polluted surface soil from mining activities in Upper Klity village, Thailand. Soil samples were collected from the residential and agricultural areas and the area of <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant. Heavy metals content presented higher in the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant area than those found in residential and agricultural areas. Lead was the predominant polluted metal with two hot spots surrounding the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant and open pit mine. Mobility distribution of these metals was followed closely with their concentration. Vertical soil profiles proved that mobility factors were only high at the top soil layer and became lower at deeper soil layers for all metals, and the quantities of lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium in both soil profiles can be ordered from large to small as: Reducible, Residual, Oxidizable, Acid extraction and Exchangeable fractions. These {{results indicated that the}} contamination was caused by anthropogenic mining activities. Potential Ecological Risk (PER) exhibited a low potential ecological risk with the averages of 3. 79 and 81. 3 in agricultural and <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant areas, respectively. However, most individual potential ecological risk values were small and classified as low for all heavy metals. This study recommends that heavy metals were unlikely to cause additional adverse health risk effects in residential and agricultural area. On the other hand, the risk of heavy metals pollution in the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant area should be of primary concern...|$|R
500|$|With {{the need}} for {{expensive}} machinery and horses and for large numbers of workers at each mine, the traditional operation of mines by extended families or by individual entrepreneurs became impractical, and the new deep-level mines came under the ownership of groups of investors and of mining companies. A group of people known as a [...] "tribute team" [...] (often a single extended family) would bid {{for the right to}} work a specified portion of the mine; the men and older boys would dig in the appointed section, and the women, girls and young boys would <b>dress</b> the <b>ore</b> sent up by the men. In later years the practice of bal maidens <b>dressing</b> only the <b>ore</b> sent up by the men of their tribute team was abandoned, and they would instead be paid a flat wage by the mine owner to <b>dress</b> any <b>ore</b> sent up, and the tribute team which had sent up the ore would be billed for the work done. Typical work for a bal maiden in this period was picking ore from rubble, breaking and separating the ore, and carrying ore and metal. Generally girls under 12 would sort the ore, older girls would separate the ore, and grown women would carry out the heavy manual labour of breaking rocks with hammers and of transporting ore between various pieces of apparatus. As the bal maidens of the smaller tribute teams often did not have the time to <b>dress</b> all the <b>ore</b> sent up, or it was not financially worthwhile to pay for the poorer quality ore to be processed, large quantities of poor quality ore were discarded unprocessed in waste heaps. On those occasions when improved extraction techniques or rises in the price of metals made it worthwhile to process this discarded ore, sometimes separate tribute teams would bid for the right to dress and process this rubble. As the practice of using tribute teams declined in the early 19thcentury, the mine owners themselves would hire bal maidens to <b>dress</b> this waste <b>ore.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{separation}} of mineral from gangue {{is known as}} mineral processing, mineral <b>dressing,</b> or <b>ore</b> <b>dressing.</b> It is a necessary, and often significant, aspect of mining. It can be a complicated process, depending {{on the nature of}} the minerals involved. For example, galena, an ore of lead, is usually found in large pieces within its gangue, so it does not normally need extensive processing to remove it; but cassiterite, the chief ore of tin, is usually disseminated as very small crystals throughout its gangue, so when it is mined from hard rock, the ore-bearing rock first needs to be crushed very finely, and then has to be subjected to sophisticated processes to separate the ore.|$|R

25|$|During {{his years}} in Cornwall, Lewis credits Kranich with {{introducing}} useful innovations at Sir Francis Godolphin's tin works, among them the hydraulic stamp mill and improved methods of <b>dressing</b> <b>ore,</b> {{as well as the}} use of charcoal as fuel for smelting instead of the traditional peat. However Lewis also allows for the possibility that these innovations should be credited to Daniel Hoechstetter. Richard Carew, on the other hand, mentions the 'rubble of certain mines and remains of a fining house' which demonstrate Kranich's 'vain endeavour in seeking of silver ore' in Cornwall. After Kranich had left Cornwall, a 16-page memorandum was prepared by William Carnsew 'relating to silver and lead mines in Cornwall and activities of Dr Burchard Kranich' in response to a request for information about the potential profitability of the mines from Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele. Among the matters covered in the memorandum were 'the many disputes and arguments Kranich had with his sponsors'. According to Wallis, Kranich's mining enterprises in the West Country were ultimately a failure, and he moved to London.|$|R

40|$|Ball mill {{is vital}} {{equipment}} in industries viz. mineral <b>dressing,</b> <b>ore</b> processing, fertilizers, food and diary, pharmaceuticals and many others. The present work involves a meticulous {{study of the}} effect of the various parameters on the performance of a ball mill. The parameters studied in this work are particle size, number of balls, time of grinding, particle density, and speed of the ball mill (rpm). An attempt has been made to develop correlation for the performance of the ball mill by correlating these variables with the grindability on the basis of dimensional analysis approach as well as fractional factorial design method. It is observed that these parameters influence the performance of the ball mill significantly. The performance of a ball mill is measured with reference to the quantity of undersize or fines (amount of grounded material passing through 120 mesh screen) per revolution of the mill, collected for variation of each of the individual parameters. Finally the calculated values of the fines in terms of the grindability of the mill obtained through the correlations by both the above-mentioned methods are compared with the experimental values thereby justifying the analysis with reasonable deviations. Thus the developed correlations can be applied to know the grindability of the Ball Mill over a wide range of parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:-The plant Biosphere {{was shown}} to be a natural biocollector and {{concentrator}} of dispersed rhenium in environment. The bioaccumulation and preconcentration of rhenium in plants can be used for its recovery from soils and waters from <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> and work processing regions. A new approach {{to the development of a}} procedure for rhenium phytorecovery is proposed. Regional investigations on the degree of rhenium accumulation in different kinds of plants growing in the vicinity of the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> mines Asarel- Medet and copper processing Medet in Bulgaria were carried out. The results showed that the plant Biosphere in these vicinities was enriched in different but considerable amounts of rhenium, which exceeded its natural spread in Earth‚Äôs crust 1400 to 44000 times. The content of rhenium in the vegetation growing along the river exceeds its content in flowing rivers 395 -times. It was shown that the concentration of rhenium in green and dry yellow leaves from the same vegetation was equal. This evidences that the dry leaves can also be used as a source for rhenium recovery. The basic advantage of Re is that this metal is preferably accumulated (more than 98 %) in green over ground parts of all kinds of plants. It is very easy to harvest the green plant mass containing rhenium at soil level, collect it together with green and dry leaves, to incinerate or treat them in different ways to concentrate rhenium.

2500|$|Although {{individual}} grains or pebbles of alluvial tin {{collected by}} streaming were often of high purity {{it was usually}} still necessary to remove the unwanted [...] "gangue" [...] material before the ore could be smelted. The need for this process, which was known as <b>dressing</b> the <b>ore,</b> increased as the poorer sources of lode tin were exploited. The principle of concentration was a refined version of that used by the early tin-streamers: it depended on the large difference in specific gravity between the wanted tin ore and the gangue. Many different mechanical methods were used, including rectangular and circular buddles, Wilfley tables and revolving slime tables, kieves, trommels, and even magnetic separation.|$|R
50|$|After 1850 {{the small}} and {{scattered}} stamp mills and ore washeries were replaced by central <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plants. The basic steps - coarse crushing - manual separation - sieving - jigging - fine crushing - table work and slime washing - remained much the same. The process was increasingly mechanised and perfected. In 1905 the most modern <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant in Germany went into operation in Clausthal using the gravity dressing process.
