5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction</b> on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction</b> (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E

40|$|Thrombolysis with tissue {{plasminogen}} activator {{increases the risk of}} brain hemorrhage after ischemic stoke. However, the relationship between the duration of ischemia and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is still unclear. In the present study, we used a rat model of thrombolysis with {{tissue plasminogen}} activator after different periods of middle cerebral artery occlusion and we analyzed the effect of the duration of ischemia on the rate of hemorrhagic transformation, the extent of cerebral infarction and the degree of neurological impairment. Most of the rats reperfused before 3 h of ischemia did not develop intracerebral hemorrhages, while 90 % of the rats occluded for more than 3 h developed cerebral hemorrhages ranging from benign <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions</b> to severe parenchymal hemorrhages. After 6 -hour occlusion, the proportion of parenchymal hemorrhages, as seen in 50 % of the animals, was significantly augmented compared to the 11 to 13 % of parenchymal hemorrhages observed in animals occluded for less than 6 h. Meanwhile, the quantity of hemoglobin measured in the brain parenchyma of animals showing <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions</b> was doubled (0. 19 mg/hemisphere in rats reperfused after 6 h of ischemia compared to 0. 08 mg/hemisphere in rats reperfused earlier). Neurological outcome did also worsen with the duration of ischemia. However, the amplitude of cerebral infarction was not statistically different in animals subjected to short or longer time of ischemia. In addition, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation and the degree of neurological impairment were not statistically different between animals occluded for less than 3 h and animals permanently occluded. Our data clearly demonstrate a progression in the risk and gravity of hemorrhagic transformation that parallels the increase in the duration of transient cerebral ischemia. The results suggest a relationship, which is independent on the duration of ischemia, between neurological deficit and hemorrhagic transformation and confirm the expected but still debated principle that early recanalization of an occluded artery reduces the hemorrhagic risk after thrombolysis with {{tissue plasminogen activator}}...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{factor is}} the prime {{initiator}} of blood coagulation. Expression of tissue factor in tumor endothelial cells leads to thrombus formation, occlusion of vessels and development of <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarctions</b> in the tumor tissue, often followed by regression of the tumor. Tumor cells produce endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which sensitizes endothelial cells for systemically administered tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and synergistically enhances the TNF-induced expression of tissue factor. We have analyzed the pathways involved in the induction of tissue factor in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after combined stimulation with TNF and VEGF. By using specific low molecular weight inhibitors, we demonstrated that protein kinase C (PKC), p 44 / 42 and p 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and stress-activated protein kinase (JNK) are essentially involved in the induction of tissue factor. In contrast, the application of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3) -kinase, led to strongly enhanced expression of tissue factor in TNF- and VEGF-treated cells, implicating a negative regulatory role for PI 3 -kinase. In vivo, the application of wortmannin promoted the formation of TNF-induced hemorrhages and intratumoral necroses in murine meth A tumors. The co-injection of wortmannin lowered the effective dose of applied TNF. Therefore, {{it is conceivable that}} the treatment of TNF-sensitive tumors with a combination of TNF and wortmannin will ensure the selective damage of the tumor endothelium and minimize the risk of systemic toxicity of TNF.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our {{objective}} was to identify risk factors that were associated with mortality and adverse neurologic outcome at 18 months of age in preterm infants with periventricular <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction.</b> METHODS. This was a retrospective cohort study of all preterm infants who were < 37 weeks' gestation, had periventricular <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarction,</b> and were admitted between 1995 and 2006. Ultrasound scans were reviewed for grading of germinal matrix hemorrhage, localization and extension of the infarction, and other abnormalities. Several clinical factors were scored. Outcome measures were mortality, cerebral palsy, and Gross Motor Function Classification System level. Odds ratios were calculated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS. Of 54 infants, 16 (30 %) died. Twenty-five (66 %) of 38 survivors developed cerebral palsy: 21 mild (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels 1 and 2) and 4 moderate to severe (levels 3 and 4). Several perinatal and neonatal risk factors were associated with mortality. After multivariate logistic regression, only use of inotropic drugs and maternal intrauterine infection were predictors of mortality.
