40|$|Drying {{of biomass}} is crucial prior {{utilizing}} its high intrinsic and readily available energy. The reduction of moisture content is mandatory to increase overall {{energy efficiency and}} reduce emission in systems operating with biomass, especially during combustion or gasification. One of the established methods of drying biomass is through fluidized bed drying. As such, the current work addresses {{the development of a}} biomass drying apparatus, designated as the swirling fluidized bed dryer (SFBD). The SFBD features an annular bed with inclined injection of gas through an array of blades which acts as the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>distributor,</b> which then imparts the swirling motion to the bed. This secondary motion inside the bed promotes the highly desired mixing and solid-fluid contact. The performance of SFBD was studied in terms of its hydrodynamic characteristic using PVC beads before tested with actual biomass from palm frond. The results show that SFBD exhibits excellent hydrodynamic characteristic with distributor to bed pressure drop ratio less then 10 %. It is also found that bed pressure drop is proportional with superficial velocity of <b>hot</b> <b>air,</b> but still reasonably low for bed weight up to 2 kg. The findings lead to a conclusion that the SFBD is capable of achieving good fluidization quality for low bed heights and suitable for biomass drying, especially that operates with batch processing...|$|R
40|$|A {{steady-state}} single-phase three-dimensional electro-chemical {{model is}} combined with a nonlinear constrained optimization procedure to maximize {{the performance of the}} cathode and the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The cathode and the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> design parameters considered include: the cathode thickness, the thickness of the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> channels and the width of the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> channels. A statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine robustness of the optimal PEM fuel cell design. The results of the optimization analysis show that higher current densities at the membrane/cathode interface are obtained in the PEM cathode and the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> geometries that promote convective oxygen transport to the membrane/cathode interface and reduce the thickness of the boundary diffusion layer at the same interface. The statistical sensitivity analysis results show that, while the predicted average current density at the membrane/cathode interface is affected by uncertainties in a number of model parameters, the optimal designs of the PEM cathode and the interdigitated <b>air</b> <b>distributor</b> are quite robust...|$|R

The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated.
