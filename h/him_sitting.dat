5|$|From 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud as {{a leader}} of the Oglala Lakota fought against US forces, attacking their forts {{in an effort to keep}} control of the Powder River Country of Montana. In support of <b>him,</b> <b>Sitting</b> Bull led {{numerous}} war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868. Sitting Bull also made guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.|$|E
5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding <b>him</b> <b>sitting,</b> covered in blood, {{on the kitchen floor}} beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter from the airport to their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} an OBE in 1974. In 1996, {{he was awarded}} honorary Irish citizenship. The honour amounts to full Irish citizenship; it is the highest honour the Irish state gives and is rarely granted. In 1994, he was made a Freeman {{of the city of}} Dublin, and was given a honorary doctorate by the University of Limerick. In 1997, he {{was appointed}} a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland. Charlton was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game. There is a life-size statue of him at Cork Airport in Ireland, representing <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> in his fishing gear and displaying a salmon.|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E

25|$|In September 1909, Erhardt {{was staying}} at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their {{daughter}} at York Harbor, Maine {{for part of the}} summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club noticed that he had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room and saw <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> at the side of his bed. Erhardt told them to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1.20a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, Macdonald {{became a}} {{part-time}} lecturer {{at the law}} school. When he left the attorney-general's office in 1924, he became a full-time professor. Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher. One former student describes <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> at his desk on the rostrum speaking slowly and deliberately while gazing intently at the ceiling. [...] "The more students disagreed (with one another in class) the more Angus encouraged it." ...|$|E
500|$|The video then {{continues}} to alternate between three different settings: Nas' journey in the Rolls Royce, {{during which he}} is driven around New York; him standing in the ring of fire, performing lyrics from the song; and <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> in a club, surrounded by several women, also performing lyrics from the song. Black-and-white shots are then shown of Nas performing at a concert, with many fans shown supporting him. Finally, the video ends with several aerial shots of New York City, and {{an image of the}} letter [...] "N" [...] burned into the ground.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Favre {{was asked}} to {{consider}} returning to the NFL {{to play for the}} injury-plagued St. Louis Rams. [...] He turned down the offer, telling WSPZ radio in Washington, D.C. that he has suffered memory loss and that he feared it was related to the multiple concussions he suffered throughout his career. He was previously asked in a 2009 interview with NBC how many times he had played with a concussion that with the new standards would have resulted in <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> out. 'A lot.', he replied.|$|E

500|$|Eric Duvauchelle, who {{was then}} part of Roc-A-Fella's {{in-house}} brand design team, was assigned for the artwork of The College Dropout. West had already taken pictures dressed as the Dropout Bear - which would reappear in his later work - and Duvauchelle picked the image of <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> {{on a set of}} bleachers, as he got attracted to the loneliness of {{what was supposed to be}} [...] "the most popular representation of a school". The image is framed inside gold ornaments, which Duvauchelle found in a book of illustrations from the 16th-century and West wanted to use to [...] "bring a sense of elegance and style to what was typically a gangster-led image of rap artists". The inside cover follows a college yearbook, with photos of the featured artists of the albums from their youth.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010 as the Jets were {{preparing}} for the playoffs, a foot fetish video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having her bare feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> at his desk with a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{faithfulness}} to Christianity, Muslim {{influence in}} the region had pervaded and influenced the culture and customs of the Christians living in Georgia and Armenia, especially after the Seljuk Turks invaded the Caucasus. Byzantine art scholar Anthony Eastmond, for example, notes that [...] "many of the outward manifestations of [...] rule were presented through Islamic customs and titles, most notably in his depiction on his principal foundation of Gandzasar." [...] The image of Hasan-Jalal on the drum of Gandzasar's dome has <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> cross-legged, which Eastmond remarks was a [...] "predominant device for depicting power at the Seljuq court." [...] Muslim influence was also seen in Hasan-Jalal's name: as a fashion of the time, many Armenians adopted Arabic patronymics (kunya) that lost any [...] "connexion with original Armenian names." [...] Hasan-Jalal's Armenian name was Haykaz but the Arabic words in his name, in fact, described his person; thus, Hasan meant handsome; Jalal, grand; Dawla, wealth and governance.|$|E
60|$|When {{they crossed}} the Epte, the King would have Richard {{in the same boat}} with <b>him,</b> and <b>sitting</b> close to Louis, and talking eagerly about falcons and hounds, the little Duke passed the {{boundary}} of his own dukedom.|$|R

500|$|Producer Norman Whitfield {{had always}} wanted to work with Paul Buckmaster, the British {{arranger}} and composer. One day he called Buckmaster and invited him to work on some recordings he had finished. After meeting, they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield's record group Rose Royce. Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and [...] "was in considerable discomfort, if not in outright pain. He didn't write a song and dance about his pain, but I remember <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> at the piano and wincing. So before jumping on the thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing, one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain." [...] Nevertheless, Whitfield and Buckmaster encouraged Gregory to write the song and the result was [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", inspired by Gregory's own situation and his deteriorating physical health.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breathing" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and premiered exclusively on PopCrush.com on November 3, 2011. The video begins with Derulo {{on the balcony of}} a building at night, as well as scenes of <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> in an old chair surrounded by cobwebs inside an industrial warehouse. There are then scenes which feature Derulo standing shirtless in a dark, blue-tinted room, digitally showing the insides of his body to show the intensity of his emotion. After the first chorus, Derulo then rises out of the chair and begins to dance. During the bridge, Derulo is shown kissing his former love interest, before several female backup dancers join him to perform choreography in the final chorus. Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro noted that the video had [...] "some impressive footwork and a great 'straight jacket' dance move with the choreographed piece with female dancers." [...] A reviewer for 4Music also praised Derulo's dance routines in the video. Contessa Gayles of AOL Music described the video as [...] "creepy" [...] and compared it to Rihanna's [...] "Disturbia" [...] (2008) video.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} of [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] was co-directed by Usher and music video {{director}} Chris Robinson, who also directed the video for the album's fourth single, [...] "My Boo". [...] "Confessions (Interlude)" [...] {{serves as the}} opening of the video. Set in a studio, Usher receives a phone message and finds out that he impregnated his mistress. After he speaks the spoken section of the interlude and gets in a car, [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] proceeds. Usher is set in a dark lit room, with only one chair. He occasionally shows a large ring on his ring finger. In the middle of the video, he lies on a piano and in his imagination, his woman and mistress are beside him. The next scene shows Usher in a brown car singing, goes out and kneels before his woman to confess. She refuses to listen and slaps Usher, then leaves and he becomes shirtless. Alone, Usher stands in front of a wide mirror, which breaks into pieces accompanied by a roaring sound, ending the same way [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] started, with <b>him</b> <b>sitting</b> on a chair.|$|E
