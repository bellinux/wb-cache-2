5|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from its <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> on other matter, as no dark matter particles {{have been observed}} in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.|$|E
5|$|The Planet Nine {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the orbits of several detached objects {{can be explained by}} the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of a large, unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU from the Sun and/or the influence of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E
50|$|Most meteoroids {{come from}} the {{asteroid}} belt, having been perturbed by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> of planets, but others are particles from comets, giving rise to meteor showers. Some meteoroids are fragments from bodies such as Mars or our moon, that have been thrown into space by an impact.|$|R
50|$|Partly {{because of}} their small total mass, open {{clusters}} have relatively poor gravitational cohesion. Consequently, open clusters tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically some 10 million years, because of external <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> amid other factors. Under exceptional conditions, open clusters can remain intact for up to 100 million years.|$|R

5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2014, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation, reached Mars orbit. ISRO launched MOM on November 5, 2013, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. The Mars Orbiter Mission used a Hohmann transfer orbit to escape Earth's <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars. The mission is the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.|$|E
5|$|SDOs are {{typically}} characterized by orbits with medium and high eccentricities with a semi-major axis greater than 50AU, but their perihelia bring them within influence of Neptune. Having a perihelion of roughly 30AU {{is one of}} the defining characteristics of scattered objects, as it allows Neptune to exert its <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{bodies in}} the Solar System, {{including}} Saturn's moon Hyperion and the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, lack a stable geographic north pole. They rotate chaotically because of their irregular shape and <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> from nearby planets and moons, {{and as a result}} the instantaneous pole wanders over their surface, and may momentarily vanish altogether (when the object comes to a standstill with respect to the distant stars).|$|R
30|$|We place 2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1 Jovian-mass planets to {{simulate}} their <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> on planetesimals initially distributed from 5 to 110 AU in a disk {{according to a}} power-law radial distribution {{with the power of}} - 0.5. Our results on the relative abundance of planetesimals do not depend on the assumed distribution of planetesimals, because each test particle in our simulation has no gravitational force on the other particles.|$|R
25|$|The {{orbit of}} each of the planets is {{slightly}} affected by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> of the other planets. Discrepancies in the early 1900s between the observed and expected orbits of Uranus and Neptune suggested that there were one or more additional planets beyond Neptune. The search for these led to the discovery of Pluto in February 1930, which was too small to explain the discrepancies. Revised estimates of Neptune's mass from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989 showed that the problem was spurious.|$|R
5|$|While most planets with orbital {{periods of}} less than 10 days have almost {{circular}} orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized {{that this could be}} due to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU). Confirmation of the existence of a second planet, HD 217107 c, followed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's {{equatorial}} plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of two masses is {{not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard quadrupole formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} a {{possible}} tenth planet {{in our solar system}} is examined. The history of the discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are reviewed. Searches of the sky with telescopes and theoretical studies of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> on the orbits of known objects in the solar system are discussed. Information obtained during the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions which could suggest the presence of an undiscovered planet and computer simulations of the possible orbit of a tenth planet are presented...|$|R

40|$|Typical {{commercial}} or laboratory-prepared samples of polycrystalline AlSb contain microstructural inhomogeneities of Al- or Sb-rich phases {{in addition to}} the primary AlSb grains. The paper reports on <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences,</b> such as density-driven convection or sedimentation, that cause microscopic phase separation and nonequilibrium conditions to exist in earth-based melts of AlSb. A triple-cavity electric furnace is used to homogenize the multiphase AlSb samples in space and on earth. A comparative characterization of identically processed low- and one-gravity samples of commercial AlSb reveals major improvements in the homogeneity of the low-gravity homogenized material...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, the {{discovery}} of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Bo√∂tis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae. The planet was discovered by measuring the star's radial velocity, which showed a periodicity of around 14.7 days corresponding to a planet at least 78% of the mass of Jupiter. These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted-for by this planet, which could be explained by the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of a more distant object.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
50|$|Periods in {{astronomy}} are conveniently expressed in various units of time, often in hours, days, or years. They can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> by other celestial objects. Such variations {{also include the}} true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies (barycenter), perturbations by other planets or bodies, orbital resonance, general relativity, etc. Most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional observations of celestial objects via astrometry.|$|R
5000|$|Solution of Majorana's {{equation}} yields {{particles that}} are their own anti-particle, now {{referred to as}} Majorana Fermions. In April 2012, some of what Majorana predicted may have been confirmed in experiments on hybrid semiconductor-superconductor wire devices. These experiments may potentially lead {{to a better understanding}} of quantum mechanics and may help build a quantum computer. There has also been speculation that at least some part of the [...] "missing mass" [...] in the universe, which cannot be detected except by inference of its <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences,</b> may be composed of Majorana particles.|$|R
30|$|However, the self-gravitating {{destabilizing}} influence {{could not}} be suppressed whatever is the greatest value of the magnitude and frequency of the periodic electric field because the <b>gravitational</b> destabilizing <b>influence</b> will persist.|$|R
5|$|The {{outer edge}} of the vulcanoid zone is {{approximately}} 0.21AU from the Sun. More distant objects are unstable due to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of Mercury and would be perturbed into Mercury-crossing orbits on timescales of the order of 100 million years. The inner edge is not sharply defined: objects closer than 0.06AU are highly susceptible to Poynting‚ÄìRobertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect, and even out to 0.09AU vulcanoids would have temperatures of 1,000K or more, which is hot enough for evaporation of rocks to be the limiting factor in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence),</b> but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Pocket watches {{were the}} {{predecessor}} of modern wristwatches. Pocket watches, {{being in the}} pocket, were usually in a vertical orientation. Gravity causes some loss of accuracy as it magnifies over time any lack of symmetry in {{the weight of the}} balance [...] The tourbillon was invented to minimize this: the balance and spring is put in a cage which rotates (typically but not necessarily, once a minute), smoothing gravitational distortions. This very clever and sophisticated clock-work is a prized complication in watches, even though the natural movement of the wearer tends to smooth <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> much more than for a pocket watch.|$|R

The results of this sample, combined with those for a sample of 30 galaxies previously analysed (Buta & Block 2001), show that the gravitational bar torque correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed in the Revised Shapley-Ames and de Vaucouleurs systems. In fact, Some classically unbarred galaxies have larger bar torques than classically barred galaxies.

50|$|In October 1807 Bode, Johann Karl Burckhardt and Francis Triesnecker {{calculated}} {{estimates of}} a parabolic orbit for the comet. Initially Bessel also calculated a parabolic orbit, but additional observations {{enabled him to}} calculate an elliptic orbit. Since this estimate of an elliptic orbit still {{did not agree with}} the observations to Bessel's satisfaction, he developed a novel method for calculating the orbital elements. Bessel's method took into account the changing <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> of the Sun and planets near to the comet and made better use of the observational data by means of a least squares estimation technique developed a few years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|R
5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc ‚Äîa disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region‚Äîwhereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the Sun to form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's <b>gravitational</b> <b>influence</b> (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.|$|E

This will allow us to generalize Newton theorem of revolving orbits to include nonlocal transforms of curves. Finally, we apply developed methods to solve the "dark Kepler problem", i. e. central force problem where in addition to the central body, <b>gravitational</b> <b>influences</b> of dark matter and dark energy are assumed.
