5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 03F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 07P) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclones ever to affect the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga. Waka originated within the near-equatorial trough in mid-December 2001, although the system remained disorganized <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December29. Subsequently, Waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a Category4 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) on December31, with winds of 185km/h (115mph). Shortly thereafter, it passed directly over Vavaʻu, Tonga, resulting in widespread damage. By January1, 2002, the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the Southern Ocean on January6.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Typhoon Bopha in the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau were significant, though limited in extent in {{comparison}} to the cyclone's intensity. Typhoon Bopha originated from a tropical depression south of Pohnpei on November25, 2012, and tracked generally westward <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> During this time, it threatened several islands across Micronesia, prompting the issuance of typhoon watches and warnings. The system skirted the Nomoi Islands on November28 where it caused limited damage. Thereafter, it became a threat to Palau as an intense typhoon. Residents there boarded up their homes and some evacuated to public shelters while officials enacted a strict curfew during the typhoon's passage. Bopha passed 55km (35mi) south of Angaur island, or 100km (65mi) south of Babeldaob, on December2 with winds of 185km/h (115mph).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Belle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, skirting the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August15 to the south of Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Guillermo was {{the ninth}} most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record, attaining peak winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure of 919hPa (27.14inHg). Forming {{out of a}} tropical wave on July30, 1997, roughly 345mi (555km) south of Salina Cruz, Mexico, Guillermo tracked in a steady west-northwestward direction while intensifying. The system reached hurricane status by August1 before undergoing rapid intensification the following day. At {{the end of this}} phase, the storm attained its peak intensity as a powerful Category5 hurricane. The storm began to weaken during the afternoon of August5 and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August8. Once entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, Guillermo briefly weakened to a tropical depression before re-attaining tropical storm status. On August15, the storm reached an unusually high latitude of 41.8°N before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants persisted <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> as they tracked towards the northeast and later south and east before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system off the coast of California on August24.|$|E

It remained at number one the following week; for its third week, it was replaced by Supremo. The album reached number one again for the week ending 12 November, and later for the week ending 11 February 2012. For its second run it remained three weeks at the top before being replaced by Maná's Drama y Luz for a week; for its third run at number one, it remained at the top spot for five weeks. For the week ending 2 June 2012, Independiente returned again to number one.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a few instances. One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
