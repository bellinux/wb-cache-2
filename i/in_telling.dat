5|$|Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. {{carriers}} {{covered the}} delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both military sides strategically considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local battle area airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based upon it soon resulted <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> effects on the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Historically, Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|Riley had {{previously}} presented a fictionalized version of Mary Alice Smith in his short story “Where Is Mary Alice Smith?,” published in The Indianapolis Journal of 30 September 1882. In it, Mary Alice arrives at her benefactor family’s home and wastes no time <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> the children a grisly story of murder by decapitation {{and then later}} introduces them to her soldier friend Dave who is soon killed upon going off to war. The plot of this short story was heavily incorporated into the 1918 movie adaptation as well as Johnny Gruelle’s 1921 storybook.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Karman, {{both men}} were PKI members and intent on making him join the party. They gave him {{communist}} pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman was late <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his emotions to make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he was more interested <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> stories and learning about art than anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who {{introduced him to the}} works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus <b>in</b> <b>telling</b> friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios <b>in,</b> <b>telling</b> Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides {{to live in a}} world without fear.|$|E
