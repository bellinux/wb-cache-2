25|$|At {{least two}} Thai films were {{produced}} in 1946. One was an action film, Chai Chatree (Brave Men), directed by journalist-turned-filmmaker Chalerm Sawetanant. The screenplay was by writer Malai Chupinij, {{who would go}} on to script other films of the era, including Chao Fah Din Salai (Till Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part). The other film noted by the National Film Archive for 1946 was an adaptation of a Thai folktale, Chon Kawao (The Village of Chon Kawao).|$|E
25|$|On the efflux of specie, Petty {{thought it}} vain {{to try to}} control it, and dangerous, as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money. He noted in Quantulumcunque {{concerning}} money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie. On exports in general, he regarded prescriptions, such as recent Acts of Parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn, as 'burthensome'. Further restrictions 'would <b>do</b> <b>us</b> twice as much harm as the losse of our said Trade' (p.59), albeit with a concession that he is no expert {{in the study of}} the wool trade.|$|E
500|$|Dot's second {{significant}} romance {{was built}} upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on {{the behest of}} producer John Yorke. Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. The Guardian critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as [...] "uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death <b>do</b> <b>us</b> part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most." ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism was {{directed}} {{at some of the}} character's aspects, and toward the introduction of the character. Jim Johnson-Smith, in American Science Fiction TV, uses an example of Ezri and Worf's concentration on their romantic relationship in the episode [...] "'Til Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] instead of being more concerned with their capture by the Breen. Ezri was described as [...] "an ill-conceived idea that never really took off and has left many DS9 fans angry that a show favourite (Jadzia Dax) isn't around any more" [...] by the website Flickering Myth. The review on DVD Talk also stated [...] "With its large ensemble cast, DS9 could have gone on perfectly well without a replacement for Jadzia. Instead, we get a [...] "replacement Dax" [...] who turns out to be, hands down, the least interesting and most annoying character DS9 has been stuck with." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the poor}} workers at whom the Noel Park {{development}} was aimed found themselves {{unable to afford}} railway tickets. The issuing of cheap early morning workman's fares on the Great Eastern Railway's lines further east in Tottenham, Stamford Hill and Walthamstow had led to overcrowding on trains and large numbers of poor workers moving to the areas (many of them displaced by {{the construction of the}} GER's Liverpool Street station in the City of London and rehoused by the company). William Birt, General Manager of the GER, was strongly against extending the policy of workmen's fares, stating that [...] "to issue them from Green Lanes would <b>do</b> <b>us</b> a very large amount of injury, and would cause the same public annoyance and inconvenience as exists already upon the Stamford Hill and Walthamstow lines" [...] and that [...] "no one living in Noel Park could desire to possess the same class of neighbours as the residents of Stamford Hill have in the neighbourhood of St Ann's Road".|$|E
500|$|This Type of Thinking (Could <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> In) was {{recorded}} in early 2004, and was released in September 2004. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA six weeks later. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic described the songs on the album as [...] "strong dynamically, but sound predetermined — they don't separate from the general loud rock malaise." [...] The song [...] "Vitamin R (Leading Us Along)" [...] was released as the first single from the album and reached the No.1 position on the Mainstream Rock chart. Two other singles were released from the album, the titles of which are [...] "The Clincher" [...] peaking at No. 3 on the Mainstream rock chart, and [...] "Panic Prone" [...] which peaked at No. 26 on the same chart. Before the album's release, Chevelle received attention when [...] "The Clincher" [...] was featured in the video game Madden NFL 2005.|$|E

On October 25, 2012, the singer performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman. For the performance, Jepsen sported a shimmery dress and slick jacket. Jepsen also performed the song at the halftime show of the 100th Grey Cup, in a medley with [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] at the 2012 American Music Awards, and at Walmart Soundcheck. Although Jepsen did {{not appear in the}} film, [...] "This Kiss" [...] was featured in the comedy Fun Size. As a promotion for the song and the film, people who bought a ticket to watch Fun Size before November 4, 2012 would get a free download of [...] "This Kiss".

500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions {{for his second}} album, tentatively named [...] "Life After Death... 'Til Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part", later shortened to Life After Death, Wallace {{was involved in a}} car accident that shattered his left leg and temporarily confined him to a wheelchair. The injury forced him to use a cane. He and Lil' Cease were arrested for smoking marijuana in public and had their car repossessed. Wallace chose a Chevrolet Lumina rental SUV as a substitute, despite [...] Lil' Cease's objections. The vehicle had brake problems before the accident but Wallace dismissed them. According to Lil' Cease, Wallace's leg was shattered when they hit a rail along with Lil's Cease's jaw. Wallace spent months in a hospital following the accident and had to complete therapy. Despite his hospitalization, he continued to work on the album. The accident was referred to in the lyrics of [...] "Long Kiss Goodnight": [...] "Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be / Til Lil' Cease crippled me." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So <b>do</b> <b>us</b> all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E

500|$|The band Motörhead {{was founded}} in 1975 by already {{experienced}} musicians. Their leader Ian [...] "Lemmy" [...] Kilmister was {{a former member of}} the space rock band Hawkwind, Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies, and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus. Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal. Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene. Motörhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions program and the first to reach No.1 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981. Lemmy himself said, [...] "the NWOBHM... didn't <b>do</b> <b>us</b> much good", because Motörhead [...] "came along a bit too early for it".|$|E
500|$|Following Bad Blood, Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Shawn Michaels and Triple H {{by making}} them shake hands. As Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, with Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a wedged chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. Lita's pregnancy was scripted into a storyline. On the June 21 episode of Raw, it appeared that Lita's then-boyfriend, Matt Hardy was going to propose to Lita, having {{found out she was}} pregnant, but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of Lita's child. Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, indeed, the father. At SummerSlam, the rivalry between Kane and Hardy intensified, when they were booked in a [...] "Till Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] match, with the stipulation that Lita would be obliged to marry Kane should Hardy lose. Kane won the match, leading to he and a reluctant Lita marrying one another on an episode of Raw. On the August 30 episode of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to them was to name any match he wanted for at the September annual event, Unforgiven. Continuing with the scripted angle, Lita informed Kane that his opponent at the event was Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband, Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. While writing the songs for Like a Prayer, Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed-the-Plow. In the play, she portrayed Karen, a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends. Karen later gets revenge, but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as {{the men who had}} partaken in this bet and exploited her. Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception, which she vented into her lyrics. The result was a set of three songs—"Till Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part", [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Oh Father"—where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons. Written with producer Patrick Leonard, in [...] "Oh Father" [...] the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father. Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment, Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind [...] "Oh Father", except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel, her favorite band at that time. She added, [...] " [...] is what the listener thinks it is, all open to interpretation. I just wrote the song, it's up to others to interpret them to mean what they want them to mean." ...|$|E
