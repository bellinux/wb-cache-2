50|$|Electrical safety {{testing is}} {{essential}} to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. In most markets it is mandatory for a product to conform to safety standards promulgated by safety and standard agencies such as UL, CE, VDE, CSA, BSI, CCC and so on. To conform to such standards, the product must pass safety tests such as the high voltage test (also called as Dielectric voltage-withstand test or high potential test), <b>Insulation</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>Test,</b> Ground (Earth) Bond & Ground Continuity Test & Leakage Current Test (also called as Line Leakage Test, Earth Leakage Current Test, Enclosure Leakage Current Test or Patient Leakage Current Test).

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} more {{reliability}} and functionalities in electronic devices {{have pushed the}} electronics industry to adopt newly developed materials and reduce interconnect sizes and spacing. These adaptations have led to concerns of reliability failures caused by conductive anodic filament formation (CAF). CAF is a conductive copper-containing salt that forms via an electrochemical process. It is initiated at the anode and grows along the epoxy/glass interface to the cathode, and once CAF reaches the cathode a short circuit will occur. The objective {{of this research is}} to evaluate and compare the effects of curing agents (DICY vs. phenolic-cured epoxy) and drilling methods (laser vs. mechanical drilling) on CAF formation using an <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> at 85 ºC, relative humidity of 85 %, and a voltage gradient of 0. 4 V/µm. Time-to-failure for DICY-cured and phenolic-cured epoxy with laser drilled microvias and mechanically drilled vias were determined using the <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test.</b> The failed coupons were cross-sectioned and examined using a Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to verify the existence of CAF. Weibull analysis was used to compare the reliability and identify the failure modes of the failed coupons. Test results show that DICY-cured epoxy is a better CAF resistant material than phenolic-cured epoxy. It is believed that the brittleness of phenolic-cured material might enhance the damage to the epoxy/glass fiber interface during drilling; and hence, facilitate subsequent CAF formation. The study also shows that laser drilled microvias are less prone to CAF formation than mechanically drilled vias, because there is less mechanical damage and lower glass fiber content. Finally, using Weibull analysis, it is determined that laser drilled microvias experienced infant-mortality failure, whereas mechanically drilled vias exhibited a wear-out type failure...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the use of}} electric vehicles worldwide has resulted in awareness of the importance of ensuring the safety of these vehicles for users. The safety of electric vehicles is greatly determined by the state of the insulation between the high voltage system and the ground. In this thesis, the behaviour of the insulation in a high voltage traction battery used in a hybrid vehicle has been studied and evaluated under different operational conditions. The objective of this thesis was to assess how much the <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> of the battery system is affected by the battery geometry and its environment of operation. The international standards applicable to insulation in electric vehicles have been studied to determine the requirements that the battery insulation system must adhere to and to determine which tests are recommended for testing the battery insulation system. In this work the results from the <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tests,</b> partial discharge tests and environmental tests performed on a battery system are presented. The results from <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tests</b> combined with environmental tests under varying temperature and humidity conditions show that the presence of moisture on the insulating surfaces of the battery greatly decreases the <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> of the battery.

40|$|Motivated by a need {{within the}} {{aerospace}} industry to detect and characterize degradation in the insulation of onboard wires, this thesis reports testing of several extant methods and development of novel capacitive sensors. This work focuses on measuring the electrical parameters resistance and capacitance that {{are directly related to}} the material parameters conductivity and permittivity, respectively, of the insulation. It is shown that the measured electrical parameters successfully indicate degradation in the wire <b>insulation.</b> <b>Insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on 17 wire samples, removed from various locations on a retired aircraft, and compared with those conducted on pristine wire samples, in order to assess any change in conductivity exhibited by degraded <b>insulation.</b> Timed <b>resistance</b> <b>tests</b> were also performed to determine the dielectric absorption of the insulation. Curved patch-electrode sensors were applied in order to measure the capacitance and dissipation factor of the same wires. Results from the resistive and capacitive tests both identified wire samples that were apparently significantly degraded, as indicated qualitatively by visual inspection. Further, a novel cylindrical interdigital capacitive sensor was developed. The interdigital sensor is designed with the goal of achieving a good signal-to-noise ratio, the lowest instrument error possible at 1 MHz, full circumferential coverage of the wire, and the ability to adjust the penetration depth of the electric field into the insulation layer by adjusting the separation of the sensor digits. With the aim, ultimately, of quantitative measurement of insulation complex permittivity, a numerical model was developed using a cylindrical Green 2 ̆ 7 s function and the Method of Moments to calculate theoretically the capacitance of the interdigital sensor. Benchmark experiments were carried out on large-scale dielectric-coated conductive cylinders to test the validity of the model. Experimental results agreed with measured results to within 5...|$|R

40|$|The All India Survey of Photovoltaic Module Reliability 2014 is an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} survey conducted in the previous year, with detailed characterization of PV modules including current-voltage, infrared and electroluminescence imaging, visual inspection, <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> and interconnect breakage test. More than a thousand modules were inspected {{in the field and}} the main results of the survey are presented in this paper. The average P-max degradation rate for the so-called good' modules (Group X) is 1. 33 %/year which is higher than that commonly projected by manufacturers, and widely employed in financial calculations. Modules falling in the not-so-good' category (Group Y) show even higher degradation rates, and it is at least partly due to higher number of micro-cracks in the modules, and increased degradation of the packaging materials like encapsulant, backsheet, etc. Modules in Hot' climates degrade faster than modules in the Non-Hot' climates. Degradation in fill factor is the primary cause for performance degradation in the young modules (ages < 5 years), whereas short-circuit current degradation is the main contributor to power degradation in the older modules. Small installations (< 100 kW(p) capacity) show higher degradation than large systems, which may be partly due to lack of proper due diligence by the owner at the time of procurement and installation...|$|E
40|$|Encapsulant {{discoloration}} is {{a common}} type of degradation in photovoltaic (PV) modules, which significantly affects its performance and reliability under field conditions. This paper presents the nondestruttive characterization techniques for investigation of encapsulant discoloration in crystalline-silicon PV modules. These characterization techniques have been channelized and applied to investigate various aspects of discoloration effects on 20 years old field-exposed PV modules. Dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) has been exploited for investigation of temperature variation and defects caused by uneven discoloration over the cells, while electroluminescence (EL) imaging has been proposed for relative quantification of extent of discoloration in a PV module. The spatially-resolved images obtained from both the techniques provided the qualitative and quantitative information about the optical and electrical effects of discoloration in a module, which is not possible by the conventional visual inspection method alone. The electrical methods including proposed differential current analysis, I-V measurement and <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>test</b> have also been used to aid this investigation. The results obtained from these techniques show that the power degradation due to discoloration was attributed to significant reduction in fill factor by non-uniform discoloration and increase in series resistance of cell contacts, {{and to some extent}} by its direct effect of light reduction. Electrical mismatch appeared {{to play an important role}} in accelerating the encapsulant discoloration in the module. These nondestructive characterization approaches can enable to inspect large number of PV modules in their actual encapsulated form by fast and efficient manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that water plays an {{important}} role in the degradation of adhesive strength between a wide variety of materials. It is also well established that silane coupling agents can provide excellent bond durability in aqueous environments. However, the detrimental effects of interfacial water are not limited to adhesive failure. The present study was motivated by concerns in the printed circuit board industry regarding the loss of electrical resistance, as well as adhesive failure, which may arise from water at epoxy/silane/E-glass interphases. The commercial silane finish used in this study provides excellent adhesive strength between epoxy and E-glass, and remarkable bond durability even after extensive conditioning in boiling water or a pressure cooker.

50|$|There are {{different}} causes for faulty cable insulation when considering solid dielectric or paper insulation. Hence, {{there are various}} test and measurement methods to prove fully functional cables or to detect faulty ones. While paper cables are primarily <b>tested</b> with DC <b>insulation</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>tests</b> the most common test for solid dielectric cable system is the partial discharge test.One needs to distinguish between cable testing and cable diagnosis.While cable testing methods result in a go/no go statement cable diagnosis methods allow judgement of the cable's current condition.With some tests it is even possible to locate {{the position of the}} defect in the insulation before failure. In some cases, Water trees can be detected by tan delta measurement. Interpretation of measurement results can in some cases yield the possibility to distinguish between new, strongly water treed cable. Unfortunately there are many other issues that can erroneously present themselves as high tangent delta {{and the vast majority of}} solid dielectric defects can not be detected with this method. Damages to the insulation and electrical treeing may be detected and located by partial discharge measurement. Data collected during the measurement procedure is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition of the tested cable. Just like with tangent delta, this method has many caveats but with good adherence to factory test standards, field results can be very reliable.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{presence}} of free moisture in power cables {{leading to the}} formation of tree structures - water treeing, which originate in the amorphous phase polyethylene and are a major cause of degradation of the polymer insulation. They represent the damage of the polymer size from several microns to 1 mm, developing technology for insulation defects under the combined action of the electric field and the moisture diffusing from the environment. Water treeing destroys the polymer chain, resulting in the formation of microcavities filled with moisture. The dynamics of water treeing and subtle properties largely depend on the composition, morphology of the polymer insulation, chemical nature of the defect, in which they originate. Due to the force of gravity in the water formed typical only for her region with locally ordered structure - clusters, which cause loss of relaxation. Purpose.

The dielectric loss tangent measured resonance method before and after aging. Originality. Experimentally found evidence of the existence in the polymer cable insulation free water in the form of areas with locally ordered structure - clusters. It is found that the solid polyethylene insulation in the frequency dependence of dielectric loss tangent maximum relaxation shown one at 10 MHz in the initial state, and there are two additional frequency range 500 kHz - 5 MHz after moistening. For cross-linked polyethylene insulation characteristic of large width Δf of the frequency spectrum in which the observed relaxation losses. It is obvious that the width of each of the relaxation maxima is associated with characteristic fractal cluster size. It is important that the hydrated solid and foamed polyethylene insulation to show individuality, typical only for water clusters which are detected by high-frequency dipole relaxation peaks dielectric loss tangent.
