5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] {{wanted to make a}} record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended {{to spend more time}} on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, roughly 50 million Americans—half the {{population}} at that time—attended the movies every week. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a [...] "boy" [...] in her old gang became [...] "impossible". She {{did not have any}} girlfriends, and school was a [...] "heartache" [...] and her home was [...] "miserable." [...] On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> beauty in the world. For the first time I saw distant lands, serene, lovely homes, romance, nobility, glamor". And further; [...] "I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass." [...] At 16, Bow says she [...] "knew" [...] she wanted to be a motion pictures actress, even if she was a [...] "square, awkward, funny-faced kid." ...|$|E

Next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> this chap {{in the long}} grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't. That hardens you: You get used {{to the fact that it}} can happen. And that it is the only sensible thing to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kitana {{was chosen}} as the best Mortal Kombat II fighter by the editors of Sega Power and Super Play for being [...] "good all around" [...] and due to her quick attacks and {{perceived}} similarities to Chun-Li. Amiga Power too called her [...] "a really good character to pick" [...] and Cinema Blend stated Kitana [...] "could absolutely dominate" [...] the game. However, GamePro's strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in MKII (citing her devastating combos, powerful [...] "Fan Throw" [...] move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by Complex, Kitana [...] "had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps." [...] "Kitana's big combos in the corner" [...] were among Ed Boon's own personal favourite things in the game: [...] "When I saw people do Kitana's combos <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something special, because people were taking the game to a new direction." [...] EGM described Kitana as [...] "a force to be reckoned with" [...] and predicted she would [...] "make a big impact as her Fan Wave leaves foes open to combos." [...] In the Game Gear version of MKII, however, Kitana's fan lifts the opponent too low and too far away for an easy combo.|$|E
