50|$|The {{growth of}} global trade and {{increasing}} security {{threats to the}} international movement of goods have forced customs administrations to shift their focus {{more and more to}} securing the international trade flow and away from the traditional task of collecting customs duties. Recognizing these developments, the WCO, drafted the WCO <b>Framework</b> <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> to Secure and Facilitate global trade (SAFE). In the framework, several standards are included that can assist Customs administrations in meeting these new challenges. Developing an Authorized Economic Operator programme is a core part of SAFE.|$|E
