The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman <b>just</b> <b>fell</b> short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E

Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan gave a negative review of the episode, stating: [...] "overall, the whole thing <b>just</b> <b>fell</b> a little flat." [...] Though Ryan appreciated the scene of Doc's death, she was critical of Torres' underdevelopment, the lack of chemistry with O'Malley, and her prom dress.

She also applauded Karev's intervening to calm Stevens down, and agreed that Grey's cliffhanger was not good.|$|E
500|$|It was Sarah, Duchess of York, who {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a great-great-great-grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her {{with the help of an}} historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both [...] "fought for their love" [...] in the midst of public scrutiny. A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King, to whom she pitched the idea along with several others. At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed, King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years. The producer later remembered, [...] "she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria’s early life: the precise span covered in The Young Victoria.

But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1957, 23 teams {{played for}} the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. The Midwest {{regional}} tourney was held in Dallas, Texas, {{which at the time}} was segregated. In the first game, the Jayhawks played the all-white SMU team, and KU player John Parker later said: [...] "The crowd was brutal. We were spat on, pelted with debris, and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible." [...] KU won 73–65 in overtime, after which police had to escort the Jayhawks out. The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant, with KU winning 81–61 under intense racist abuse. In the semi-finals, Chamberlain's Jayhawks handily defeated the two time defending national champion San Francisco, 80–56, with Wilt scoring 32 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and having at least seven blocked shots. (Game film is unclear whether an 8th block occurred, or the ball <b>just</b> <b>fell</b> short due to Chamberlain's withering defensive intimidation). Chamberlain demonstrated his growing arsenal of offensive moves, including jump shots, put-backs, tip-ins, and his turnaround jump shot. He was far more comfortable and effective at the foul line than he would later be during his pro career. He had outstanding foot speed throughout the game, and several times led the fast break, including blocking a shot near the basket and then outracing the field for a layup. His stellar performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead, and he rested on the bench for the final 3:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
