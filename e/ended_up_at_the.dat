5|$|Hogarth {{was well}} acquainted with the struggles of the Grub Street hack though, through the travails of his own father, Richard, who {{had been unable to}} make a living as writer and had {{eventually}} <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fleet Prison as a bankrupt. Hogarth may have been more than sympathetic to the dunce struggling with his rhymes. Jenny Uglow in her biography of Hogarth, posits that the gradual alteration of the prints above the poet's head could suggest a slow softening of attitudes towards Pope and his attack on the class of writer to which Hogarth's father had belonged, and perhaps evidence of Hogarth making his own compromises in his endeavours to become successful.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E

25|$|On March 17, 1937, Earhart and {{her crew}} flew {{the first leg}} from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. In {{addition}} to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Mantz (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the aircraft needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the Electra <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> United States Navy's Luke Field on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board. During the takeoff run, Earhart ground-looped, circumstances of which remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field including the Associated Press journalist on the scene said they saw a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources, including Mantz, cited pilot error.|$|E
25|$|On a cold {{morning of}} February 1827, John left {{his home and}} went {{to look for work}} as a farm-servant. At 12, he found life at home {{unbearable}} because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself {{at such a young age}} may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wine farm of Louis Moglia. Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years. In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.|$|E

Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as he walked back to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years.

Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
