40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the electrochemical behavior of the Ce 4 +/ 3 + redox couple has been performed, in order to attempt a rationalization of the electron transfer at strongly positive potentials. Experiments {{have been carried out}} at highly boron-doped diamond (BDD) (resistivity: 15 mOhm cm) and polycrystalline gold, in aqueous 1 M HClO 4. The influence of temperature on the electron transfer kinetics has also been investigated at both electrode materials, thus allowing a comparison that practically confirms the metal-like properties of BDD as an electrode, in spite of its being a highly <b>doped,</b> <b>semi-conductor.</b> The electron transfer rate was only slightly affected by the degree of hydrophilicity of the diamond surface. At polycrystalline gold surfaces, which are oxidized under the required experimental conditions, k 0 was found to be almost one order of magnitude higher than at BDD, as a possible consequence of higher hydroxy group coverage...|$|E

40|$|We {{apply the}} muffin-tin {{effective}} medium approximation {{to calculate the}} temperature dependence of the resistivity and thermopower of amorphous and liquid metals. The results show unambiguously that a large resistivity {{is accompanied by a}} negative temperature coefficient, in agreement with the experimental situation. This behavior is shown to result from a pseudo-gap which opens in the one-particle spectrum due to strong scattering at the quasi zone boundary and which tends to close under an increase in temperature. In turn the thermopower is found to have non-trivial density and temperature dependences. I. INTRODUCTION The influence of a disordered potential on the motion of electrons remains an interesting problem despite of decades of work. The aim of solving this problem is to elucidate the properties, if not the existence, of a whole range of materials, such as <b>doped</b> <b>semi-conductors,</b> <b>doped</b> Mott insulators, amorphous and liquid metals, to quote a few.

40|$|Abstract. A {{mathematical}} model is introduced which describes the dissipation of elec-trons in lightly <b>doped</b> <b>semi-conductors.</b> The dissipation operator is {{proved to be}} densely defined and positive and to generate a Markov semigroup of operators. The spectrum of the dissipation operator is studied and it is shown that zero is a simple eigenvalue, which makes the equilibrium state unique. Also it is shown {{that there is a}} gap between zero and the rest of its spectrum which makes the return to equilibrium exponentially fast in time. The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work. (J. von Neumann [51]) 1...|$|R
40|$|Nanofluidics {{has emerged}} {{recently}} {{in the footsteps of}} microfluidics, following the quest of scale reduction inherent to nanotechnologies. By definition, nanofluidics explores transport phenomena of fluids at the nanometer scales. Why is the nanometer scale specific ? What fluid properties are probed at nanometric scales ? In other words, why 'nanofluidics' deserves its own brand name ? In this critical review, we will explore the vast manifold of length scales emerging for the fluid behavior at the nanoscales, as well as the associated mechanisms and corresponding applications. We will in particular explore the interplay between bulk and interface phenomena. The limit of validity of the continuum approaches will be discussed, as well as the numerous surface induced effects occuring at these scales, from hydrodynamic slippage to the various electro-kinetic phenomena originating from the couplings between hydrodynamics and electrostatics. An enlightening analogy between ion transport in nanochannels and transport in <b>doped</b> <b>semi-conductors</b> will be discussed.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new method based on the {{high-frequency}} electromagnetic (EM) -semiconductor coupled simulation to analyze the impact of multi-type process variations happen around semi-conductormetal structure. It is competent to simultaneously handle geometrical variations like surface roughness and material variations like <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>doping</b> profile, which are difficult for traditional stand alone simulation methods. A sparse grid based stochastic spectral collocation method (SSCM) combined with principle factor analysis (PFA) is implemented to accelerate the stochastic simulation.

40|$|The Rhodotron is a high-voltage, {{high-power}} {{electron beam}} accelerator {{based on a}} design concept first proposed in 1989 by J. Pottier of the French Atomic Agency, Commissariat a 1 'Energie Atomique (CEA). In December 1991, the Belgian particle accelerator manufacturer, Ion Beam Applications s. a. (IBA) entered into an exclusive agreement with the CEA to develop and industrialize the Rhodotron. Electron beams have long been used as the preferential method to cross-link a variety of polymers, either in their bulk state or in their final form. Used extensively in the wire and cable industry to toughen insulating jackets, electron beam-treated plastics can demonstrate improved tensile and impact strength, greater abrasion resistance, increased temperature resistance and dramatically improved fire retardation. Electron beams are used to selectively cross-link or degrade {{a wide range of}} polymers in resin pellets form. Electron beams are also used for rapid curing of advanced composites, for cross-linking of floor-heating and sanitary pipes and for cross-linking of formed plastic parts. Other applications include: in-house and contract medical device sterilization, food irradiation in both electron and X-ray modes, pulp processing, electron beam <b>doping</b> of <b>semi-conductors,</b> gemstone coloration and general irradiation research. IBA currently markets three models of the Rhodotron, all capable of 10 MeV and alternate beam energies from 3 MeV upwards. The Rhodotron models TT 100, TT 200 and TT 300 are typically specified with guaranteed beam powers of 35, 80 and 150 kW, respectively. Founded in 1986, IBA, a spin-off of the Cyclotron Research Center at the University of Louvain (UCL) in Belgium, is a pioneer in accelerator design for industrial-scale production.

40|$|Hybrid photovoltaic/thermal (PV-T) solar {{collectors}} {{are capable of}} delivering heat and electricity concurrently. Implementing such receivers in linear concentrators for high temperature applications need special considerations such as thermal decoupling of the photovoltaic (pv) cells from the thermal receiver. Spectral beam splitting of concentrated light provides an option for achieving this purpose. In this paper we introduce a relatively simple hybrid receiver configuration that spectrally splits the light between a high temperature thermal fluid and silicon pv cells using volumetric light filtering by <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>doped</b> glass and propylene glycol. We analysed the optical performance of this device theoretically using ray tracing and experimentally through the construction and testing of a full scale prototype. The receiver was mounted on a commercial parabolic trough concentrator in an outdoor experiment. The prototype receiver delivered heat and electricity at total thermal efficiency of 44 % and electrical efficiency of 3. 9 % measured relative to the total beam energy incident on the primary mirror. © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
