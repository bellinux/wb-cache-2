40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} nature and structure of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> in the manufacturing sector of Indonesia with the following objectives: (1) examine government 2 ̆ 7 s policies toward foreign private investment and <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> (2) investigate the characteristics of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> and (3) study the impact of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> on {{the growth of the}} Indonesian manufacturing sector. ^ The study finds that 50. 2 percent of all manufacturing <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> were established between the Indonesian partners and partners from four newly industrialized countries (NICs). Compared to <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed and other developing countries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with NICs are characterized with low total investment, low investment per worker, low machinery investment per worker, high average number of Indonesian workers and expatriates, and high percentage of output intended for export. ^ In all industries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries are more capital intensive than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs. In terms of market orientation, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs are more export oriented than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries. ^ Labor productivity and labor income growth are the most important contributions of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> to manufacturing industries. Significant structural change in the manufacturing sector occurred during the study period. The output and value added shares of labor-intensive industries decreased in favor of capital-intensive industries. Labor productivity, employment, and firm size also increased notably. The study shows that <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> made significant contributions to the changes. ^ In examining Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s ability to attract foreign direct investment in manufacturing <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> the study finds that GNP growth and the ratios of gross domestic investment to GNP, the value of manufactured imports to GNP, the value of exports to value of imports, and the value of commerce, transportation and communication output to GDP are important determinants. On the ownership issue, the study showed that the foreign partners 2 ̆ 7 share of ownership is negatively related to debt/equity ratio but positively correlated to the percentage of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> 2 ̆ 7 output intended for export. ...|$|R

However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} both formal (legal) and informal (culture, language, religion) institutions determine {{the intensity of}} cross-border <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> between one U.

Utilizing a sample of cross-border <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> from 105 countries, we show that countries with weaker legal and regulatory environments and with higher cultural, language, and religious disparity from the U. S. are characterized with higher volume of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures.</b> On the other hand, compared to mergers between a foreign target and a U. S. bidder, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> are formed more likely with firms from countries with strong laws and regulations, {{as well as with}} smaller cultural, language, and religious differences from the U.

However, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> display market-like characteristics when the alternative deal structure is a merger. Our results further suggest that foreign countries receiving large U.
