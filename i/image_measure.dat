In this paper, we present a “blind ” image quality measure, where potentially neither the groundtruth image nor the degradation process are known.

40|$|A {{prerequisite}} for successful clinical use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is {{the selection of}} an appropriate imaging sequence. In this paper, 2 D and 3 D fMRI sequences were compared using different image quality assessment methods. Descriptive <b>image</b> <b>measures,</b> such as activation volume and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR), were compared with results from Visual Grading Characteristics (VGC) analysis of the fMRI results. It was found that significant differences in activation volume and TSNR were not directly reflected by differences in VGC scores. The results suggest that better performance on descriptive <b>image</b> <b>measures</b> is not always an indicator of improved diagnostic quality of the fMRI results.

40|$|Automatic <b>image</b> <b>measuring</b> is to {{identify}} and to measure conjugate points in two or more overlapping photographs automatically. In digital photogrammetry, this process is done by image matching. A straightforward way to make image matching well-posed is to restrict the space of possible solutions and provide good initial parallax. Initial parallax {{is related to the}} searching space. The better the initial parallax, the smaller the searching space. So in image matching, the initial parallax should be determined firstly. Since IMU/DGPS system can get exterior orientation (EO) parameters of the image, using the EO parameters and the corresponding elevation to predict the location of conjugate points can get a better initial parallax. Thus, the limitation of traditional method in deciding initial parallax, such as gaining incorrect initial parallax, large searching space, etc, may be hopefully improved. Then the operator's interference in automatic <b>image</b> <b>measuring</b> will reduce and the efficiency, reliability of image matching will increase. This paper studies the use of IMU/DGPS data in automatic <b>image</b> <b>measuring.</b> Using IMU/DGPS data to decide the initial parallax can avoid the dependence of image condition. So the parallax decided will be better than that of the gray-correlation's which is depended on image condition. In this paper, two methods are introduced to decide the initial parallax. They are gray-correlation and IMU/DGPS data supported. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the applicability and strongpoint of IMU/DGPS-supported automatic <b>image</b> <b>measuring.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the ability to predict the {{probability}} of elephant (Loxodonta africana) presence in an agricultural landscape of Zimbabwe based on three methods of measuring the spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover, where vegetation cover was measured using the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) -derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The three methods of measuring spatial heterogeneity were: one wavelet-derived spatial heterogeneity measure; and two direct <b>image</b> <b>measures.</b> The wavelet-derived spatial heterogeneity measure consists of the intensity, which measures the maximum contrast in the vegetation cover, and the dominant scale, which determines the scale at which this intensity occurs.
