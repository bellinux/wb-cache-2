I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It <b>frightened</b> <b>me</b> to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I would have said so. I did not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E

2500|$|Helene {{noted in}} her book that she exposed herself and her family to great danger by {{assisting}} the queen in her efforts to obtain the crown. In an atmosphere of political intrigue, where death was a common punishment for many crimes, Helene apparently had reservations concerning the advisibility of the queen's request: [...] "The queen's request <b>frightened</b> <b>me,</b> for it meant great danger {{for me and my}} little children." [...] In her writing she describes how she prayed for success and promised to make a barefoot pilgrimage to Zell. At least two assistants accompanied Helene, who did the breaking in while Helene kept watch. After they got the crown without attracting attention, they locked the doors again and fixed the queen's seal.|$|E
2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. It was sad {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that <b>frightened</b> <b>me</b> more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It <b>frightened</b> <b>me</b> and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
