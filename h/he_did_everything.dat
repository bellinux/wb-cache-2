5|$|Hawks's first all {{sound film}} was The Dawn Patrol, {{based on an}} {{original}} story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written Wings. He {{was considered one of}} the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it. Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an Academy Award for Best Story in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic Hell's Angels, which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> he could to sabotage The Dawn Patrol. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two Royal Flying Corps pilots during World War I who deal with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.|$|E
25|$|By private interviews, wrote a Roman Catholic {{historian}} {{who was also}} bishop of Przemyśl, which they could always command, the Jesuits so bound the king by their solicitations that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> according to their counsel, and the hopes and cares of courtiers had no weight except by their favour. Chief among these advisers of the king was Piotr Skarga, {{one of the most}} eminent of Polish Jesuits. Born in Mazovia in 1536, he was educated at the Jagiellonian University, where he distinguished himself by receiving an academic degree prima Laurea. He then proceeded to Rome, where he entered the society in 1568. He began his preaching at Pułtusk, and visited the colleges that Stephen Báthory had founded at Riga, Dorpat and Połock; his eloquence was very successful, and even now his sermons are thought highly of in Poland. On the accession of Sigismund he became royal chaplain and he founded a confraternity of St. Lazarus in Warsaw and many other establishments elsewhere in the country.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} of Hextall {{in the next}} game tied the series and forced a seventh game; at the end, the Flyers team surrounded Hextall in congratulation and the Oilers player Kevin Lowe said that Hextall [...] "held them in it". Between the sixth and seventh games, the Oilers' forward Wayne Gretzky described Hextall as [...] "probably the best goaltender I've ever played against in the NHL" [...] Edmonton won {{the final game of}} the series to take the Stanley Cup. Robin Finn, writing in The New York Times, said that the team won the title [...] "without their trademark, those endless waves of madcap scoring", primarily due to the [...] "heroics of Hextall". Flyers teammate Rick Tocchet said that when he realised his side were going to lose, his [...] "first thought was to feel sorry for Ronny Hextall, because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> he could to get us here and keep us in it." [...] Hextall was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for the most valuable player in the playoffs, becoming only the fourth player from a losing side to be awarded the trophy. During the off-season, Hextall received an eight-game suspension {{for the start of the}} 1987–88 season after his slash on Nilsson. Speaking on behalf of the NHL, Brian O'Neill said that: [...] "There is no justification for any player to swing his stick in retaliation and this is especially the case for a goaltender whose stick, because of its weight, can cause serious injury." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2000, Howarth {{played for}} Premier League club Leeds United in a seven-a-side tournament in Singapore, because their own goalkeepers were unavailable. He also {{represented}} York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament {{for a second}} successive summer, although he only played one match as he was being rested after playing for Leeds. His first appearance of 2000–01 came 22 August 2000, in York's 5–1 defeat at home to Stoke City in the League Cup first round first leg. During the match, he fumbled a Graham Fenton cross, and Stoke opened the scoring from the error. He garnered praise from York's part-time goalkeeping coach and former Everton player Neville Southall, who Howarth held as a boyhood hero, saying: [...] "Russ can {{be as good as}} he wants to be. He works hard and has a great attitude when a lot of youngsters today at big clubs don't have such a good attitude. He will succeed. Even if it is in three, five or even ten years, he will succeed." [...] With Fettis rested, Howarth made his second appearance of the season on 9 January 2001, starting in a 4–0 defeat at home to Darlington in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Despite conceding four goals, he was the only player to escape criticism from manager Terry Dolan, who said: [...] "He was let down by everyone else around him. He had no protection whatsoever. His kicking was excellent and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> else he had to do without a problem." [...] Due to the good form of Fettis, Howarth finished the season with only two appearances.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{opened his}} junior season, {{and his first}} year under coach Pat Chambers, on November 5, 2011 in an {{exhibition}} game against Slippery Rock. He led the team in scoring with 19 points. Frazier also posted 7 assists and 6 rebounds, helping Penn State win the game 64–47. He {{took part in the}} Nittany Lions' first regular season contest on November 12 against Hartford, with 12 points, 6 assists, and 5 steals in spite of being given 28 minutes on the court. When asked on his communication with Frazier, Chambers said, [...] "I'm telling him to make plays... he has to be one of our leading scorers. He's got to look to score." [...] In the following game, Frazier made his second career display with 20 or more points. He also matched his career-high total on assists, with 10. This was his second double-double with Penn State. Frazier also finished with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and 1 block. Chambers said in a post-game interview, [...] "I'm very greedy. I'm an old point guard, so I want more out of Tim Frazier, if you can imagine... what more means is even more leadership, even better habits. We're always trying to create the best habits we can for the most difficult situation.". Frazier helped power the 62–46 victory over Radford, the team's second consecutive win in the regular season. It was also Penn State's first round game in the Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament. In his next game against LIU-Brooklyn, Frazier scored a career-high 26 points and matched his assists record for the second straight game, with 10. It was his second-straight double-double and the third in his stint with Penn State. Chambers commented after the game, [...] "Tim was terrific. He was a great leader tonight. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> you ask your point guard to do tonight." [...] He helped the program reach a 3–0 record {{for the third time in}} 12 seasons. Following up on a loss to Kentucky, Frazier recorded 27 points on November 20, 2011 against South Florida. The next game, Frazier recorded a career-high 11 assists en route to his 4th double-double in 2011. On January 11, 2012, Frazier scored a career-high 30 points against Nebraska, with his team losing the game, 70–58. He led the Big Ten with eight 20-point games through the course of the year. By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 18.8 points, 6.2 assists, 4.7 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 0.2 blocks. It was his highest scoring average with Penn State. He was named the John Lawther Team MVP, Second Team NABC All-District, All-Big Ten First Team, Academic All-Big Ten, Basketball Times' All-District, and Big Ten All-Defensive Team.|$|E

2500|$|In general, however, Douglas's acting style {{fit well}} with Minnelli's {{preference}} for [...] "melodrama and neurotic-artist roles," [...] writes film historian, James Naremore. He adds that Minnelli had his [...] "richest, most impressive collaborations" [...] with Douglas, and for Minnelli, no other actor portrayed his level of [...] "cool": [...] "A robust, athletic, sometimes explosive player, Douglas loved stagy rhetoric, and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> passionately."

2500|$|It {{was said}} that {{the first phase of}} the CAR's {{construction}} was undertaken without any government assistance, which was unusual at the time. Booth himself was concerned with building the railways as well as marketing the service to build and maintain tonnage on the new lines. [...] He was open to cooperation with other railways in eastern and western Canada, as well as to sale or amalgamation with a larger railway system, and was contemplating such a sale by 1901. Whether it was because Booth at age 74 was tired, or because he realized that competition from other transcontinental lines would soon cause serious problems for the CAR, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> possible in the early years of the 20th century to make every aspect of the railway profitable, and therefore attractive to potential buyers.|$|E

2500|$|Once Sekelj {{returned}} to Yugoslavia in the 1960s, he began getting TV coverage as a journalist. And because his forays into unknown areas required {{more than just}} pictures—they required film—Tibor accepted the challenge. He began using his knowledge as a filmmaker, not only directing himself but also using sound and light, camera work and more on his trips to New Guinea and Australia. For Zagreb television he filmed a series of films about those regions and their natives that became a 10-hour-long travel film series seen across Yugoslavia. [...] Amazingly, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> on those films alone. In the later part of the 1970s he made films about Colombia and Ecuador where he used a professional team of filmmakers from Novi Sad Television, which promoted his travel films.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} artists that lived on Sretensky Boulevard became loosely {{associated}} by their like-minded {{ideas in the}} 1960s. [...] Primarily identified as Kabakov, Eduard Steinberg, Erik Bulatov, Viktor Pivovarov and Vladimir Yankilevsky, the group also included Oleg Vassiliev, Ülo Sooster and others with the same pre-occupation. [...] The artist's studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. [...] The majority of visual artists who {{became part of the}} Stretensky Boulevard Group worked officially as book illustrators and graphic designers. There were in strong contrast to a group called the Lianozovo artists, a loose group around Oscar Rabine, who were primarily abstractionists. [...] This group in particular was often harassed and in some cases imprisoned or exiled. [...] It is apparent that Kabakov and his associates were conformist as a survival strategy, a tactic which began at the art academies. Kabakov reports that during school and throughout his early career <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> expected of him and, on the surface, accepted the Soviet reality.|$|E

He was enamoured by The Andrews Sisters, who hired his trio to open for them during a tour in 1946. Their manager, Lou Levy, said watching Paul's fingers while he played guitar was like watching a train go by. Their conductor, Vic Schoen, said his playing was always original. [...] Maxine Andrews said, [...] "He'd tune into the passages we were singing and lightly play the melody, sometimes in harmony. We'd sing these fancy licks and he'd keep up with us note for note {{in exactly the same}} rhythm...almost contributing a fourth voice. But he never once took the attention away from what we were doing. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> he could to make us sound better." [...] In the 1950s, when he recorded Mary Paul's vocals on multiple tracks, he created music that sounded like The Andrews Sisters.|$|E
