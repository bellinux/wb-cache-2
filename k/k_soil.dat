40|$|Tall fescue is an {{important}} forage grass which can host systemic fungal endophytes. The association of host grass and endophyte is known to influence herbivore behavior and host plant competition for resources. Establishing legumes into existing tall fescue sods is a desirable means to acquire nitrogen and enhance the nutritive value of forage for livestock production. Competition from existing tall fescue typically must be controlled to ensure interseeding success. We used a soil-on-agar method to determine if soil from intact, living (L), or an herbicide killed (K) tall fescue sward influenced germination and seedling growth of three cultivars of tall fescue (E+, MaxQ, and E−) or legumes (alfalfa, red clover, and white clover). After 30 days, seedlings were larger and present in greater numbers when grown in L soil rather than <b>K</b> <b>soil.</b> Root growth of legumes (especially white clover) and tall fescue (especially MaxQ) were not as vigorous in <b>K</b> <b>soil</b> as L soil. While shoot biomass was similar for all cultivars of tall fescue in L soil, MaxQ produced less herbage when grown in <b>K</b> <b>soil.</b> Our data suggest establishing legumes or fescue cultivars may not be improved by first killing the existing fescue sod and seedling performance can exhibit significant interseasonal variation, related only to soil conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{values of}} the snow and soil thermal conductivity, k snow and <b>k</b> <b>soil,</b> {{strongly}} impact the thermal regime of {{the ground in the}} Arctic, but very few data are available to test model predictions for these variables. We have monitored k snow and <b>k</b> <b>soil</b> using heated needle probes at Bylot Island in the Canadian High Arctic (73 ° N, 80 ° W) between July  2013 and July  2015. Few k snow data were obtained during the 2013 – 2014 winter, because little snow was present. During the 2014 – 2015 winter k snow monitoring at 2, 12 and 22  cm heights and field observations show that a depth hoar layer with k snow around 0. 02  W m − 1  K − 1 rapidly formed. At 12 and 22  cm, wind slabs with k snow around 0. 2 to 0. 3  W m − 1  K − 1 formed. The monitoring of <b>k</b> <b>soil</b> at 10  cm depth shows that in thawed soil <b>k</b> <b>soil</b> was around 0. 7  W m − 1  K − 1, while in frozen soil it was around 1. 9  W m − 1  K − 1. The transition between both values took place within a few days, with faster thawing than freezing and a hysteresis effect evidenced in the thermal conductivity–liquid water content relationship. The fast transitions suggest that the use of a bimodal distribution of <b>k</b> <b>soil</b> for modelling may be an interesting option that deserves further testing. Simulations of k snow using the snow physics model Crocus were performed. Contrary to observations, Crocus predicts high k snow values {{at the base of the}} snowpack (0. 12 – 0. 27  W m − 1  K − 1) and low ones in its upper parts (0. 02 – 0. 12  W m − 1  K − 1). We diagnose that this is because Crocus does not describe the large upward water vapour fluxes caused by the temperature gradient in the snow and soil. These fluxes produce mass transfer between the soil and lower snow layers to the upper snow layers and the atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the importance of the structure and properties of the Arctic snowpack on subnivean life, as species such as lemmings live under the snow most of the year and must travel in the lower snow layer in search of food...|$|E

Soybean yield in conservation tillage systems may be improved by banding K fertilizer below seeding depth. Certain soybean seed quality parameters may also be affected by K fertilizer management systems since K is so essential in plant enzymes. The objectives of this research were to investigate K nutrition, yield, and quality responses of soybeans resulting from alternate K fertilizer placements (band placement versus surface broadcasting, and applied directly before soybeans versus residual effects associated with application to previous corn) in various tillage (such as zone-till, fall disk, and NT) and row-width systems imposed after long-term NT. All 17 experimental site-years had a minimum 5 -yr NT history prior to treatment initiation. Soybean responses to K placement were generally unaffected by tillage and row width (from 18 to 76 cm) on medium- to high-exchangeable <b>K</b> <b>soils.</b> Trifoliate leaf <b>K</b> concentrations were increased by K application even on medium- to high-testing <b>K</b> <b>soils.</b> Yield responded positively to direct K fertilization most frequently on low <b>K</b> <b>soils.</b> Despite vertical <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> stratification, deep banded K increased yield, relative to broadcast K, only on low <b>K</b> <b>soils</b> and only when most soybean rows were {{in close proximity to}} fertilizer bands.

Soybean seed K concentrations increased up to 3 g kg− 1 after both direct and residual K applications. Potassium fertilization increased daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavone concentrations in soybean seeds. Seed isoflavone concentrations were positively correlated to yield, seed K and oil concentrations. There was no apparent yield or seed composition benefit from banded versus broadcast K application except on low <b>K</b> <b>soils.</b> Possible preceding corn row impacts on horizontal <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> distribution should be considered when narrow-row NT soybeans follow corn on soils with low to medium K concentrations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Crop {{fertilisation}} with potassium in {{rainfed agriculture}} in India is not practised, merely {{on the assumption}} that Indian soils are rich in potassium and crops do not need external K supply. However, under continuous cropping in rainfed regions, huge crop K removals are reported, up to 150 – 200 kg/ha annually, depending upon amount and distribution of rainfall and biomass production. Thus, most of the crops essentially deplete <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> reserves. The present study evaluates the <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> reserves under diverse rainfed production systems and categorises rainfed soils based on different <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> fractions. Depth-wise sampling was done from 21 locations across different soil types under 8 production systems, and various fractions of <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> were determined. Total K was highest in Inceptisols (1. 60 – 2. 28 %), followed by Aridisols (1. 45 – 1. 84 %), Vertisols and Vertic sub-groups (0. 24 – 1. 72 %), and Alfisols and Oxisols (0. 30 – 1. 86 %), showing a wide variation within each group. Nonexchangeable K reserves were found in a proportionate manner to total K in most of the soil profile. Unlike nonexchangeable K reserves, Vertisols had higher exchangeable K than Inceptisols and Alfisols/Oxisols. Nonexchageable K showed significant positive correlation with total K in Inceptisols and Vertisols, whereas it was non-significant in Alfisols/Oxisosls. However, significant positive correlations were recorded with exchangeable K and nonexchangeable <b>K</b> in all <b>soil</b> types, indicating the dynamic equilibrium between 2 <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> fractions.

Since erosion research is normally expensive and time-consuming, the use of models allows to estimate soil losses at locations and under conditions not represented directly in the research. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the soil erosion in an area intensively cultivated with sugarcane near the city of Piracicaba, São Paulo, contributing to diagnose the current land uses aimed at controlling erosion. The study was carried out based on a geographic information system using the universal soil loss equation (USLE) to estimate erosion. A specific objective of the study was to analyze the influence of <b>K</b> (<b>soil</b> erodibility), LS (topography), C (crop use and management) and P (erosion control practices) factors in soil loss estimates. The results show an intense soil degradation process by accelerated erosion in nearly two-thirds of the studied area, mainly occupied by sugarcane. In these areas, the average estimated soil loss rate of 58 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 is equivalent to nearly four times the indicated average upper tolerance limit. In the remaining areas occupied by forest, riparian vegetation, afforestation and pasture, the estimated soil loss rates are low, around 2 Mg ha- 1 year- 1, below the tolerance values. The model factor sensitivity analysis revealed that under the same weather condition (constant R factor), factors C and P (crop management and coverage and erosion control practices) defined the magnitude of the soil losses, whether in units, tens or hundreds of Mg ha- 1 year- 1.

K fertilization significantly affected to corn plant height in the low soil K status until the rate of 60 kg K ha- 1 (116 kg KCl ha- 1).

The ears of corn could not develop without K fertilization. This was an evidence that K nutrient has an important role in enzyme activity and assimilate translocation. Even with low rate of K fertilization, corn has succeeded to form ears and kernels. In the low soil K status, K fertilization sharply increased dry grain, but in the medium soil K status the curve was gentler.

Field experi-ments from 1998 to 2001 on soils with low to high exchangeable potassium (K) concentrations evalu-ated K fertilizer application and placement effects on isoflavone concentrations and composition of soy-bean in various tillage and row width systems. Soy-bean seed yield and concentrations of daidzein, genistein, glycitein, leaf K, and seed K were mea-sured. Significant increases in daidzein, genistein, and total isoflavone in soybean seed were observed with deep-banded K or surface-broadcast K fertilizer on low and medium <b>K</b> <b>soils.</b> Positive effects of K fertilization on isoflavones were less frequent o...|$|R

40|$|Lac is {{a natural}} resin of {{outstanding}} properties and exceptional versatility, secreted by tiny coccid insect Kerria lacca, which is reared on some specific plants. Lac insect take their nutrition from the host plant, hence soil nutrient become most important component for sustainable lac cultivation and host plant growth. Therefore, to determine the suitable nutrient combination dose of N, P and K on lac host plant growth, lac yield and their predation and parasitization an experiment was undertaken. The result showed N, P and <b>K</b> <b>soil</b> nutrient combination in treatment 2 (T 2 =N 15 :P 5 :K 5) {{was found to be}} the most suitable for lac production and least insect pest infestation. The soil nutrient supplied to plants was positively influences the F. semialata plant growth. It shows that soil nutrient must be applied for lac cultivation on F. semialata for their sustainable development, better lac production and less predator infestation...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of fertilizer use is changing greatly depending on soil properties, fertilizer type, irrigation {{and level of}} intensive cultivation. A site specific potassium (K) experiment was conducted to formulate the fertilizer recommendation of K for rice plant in different <b>K</b> <b>soil</b> status. The objective of this research were to select a proper soil test method, classify the soil test value of K into two or more classes and fertilizer recommendation of K to rice plant. The result showed that the method of NH 4 OAc 1 N pH 7 was the best technique for soil analysis. Based on the method, there are 3 available classes of K i. e. low, medium and high. The soil with the highest availability of K does not require fertilizing with K, {{because it has been}} fulfilled by the water irrigation and straw. The fertilizer recommendation of K for rice plant at medium class is less than low class. </p...|$|E
40|$|A 3 -year {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} broiler litter relative to inorganic fertilizer on soil nutrient content and quality in an upland Loring silt loam soil. Treatments included annual broiler litter rates of 0, 2. 2, 4. 5, 5. 6, 6. 7, 10. 1, and 13. 4 Mg ha− 1 y− 1 and commercial fertilizer rates of 34, 68, 90, 112, 134, and 168 kg nitrogen (N) ha− 1 y− 1. Broiler litter application linearly increased soil total carbon (C), microbial biomass C, extractable soil phosphorus (P), potassium (<b>K),</b> <b>soil</b> cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the stability of soil aggregate. At the highest broiler litter rate, the stability of soil aggregate was 34 % greater than inorganic fertilizer. Application of broiler litter or fertilizer N at rate greater than 6. 7 Mg ha− 1 or 90 kg N ha− 1, respectively, exceeded plant N utilization potential as evidenced by higher end-of-season soil residual nitrate (NO 3) -N. Broiler litter is more effective in improving soil physical, chemical, and biological components than conventional fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|Potassium (K) is {{required}} in a large amount for plant growth and production of most fruit crops, including pineapple. However, excess application may decrease its growth and production. Therefore, fertilizer application must be site specifi c, based on soil nutrient status and plant requirements. The aims of the research were (1) to determine the <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> nutritional status of pineapple and (2) to determine the optimum dosage of K fertilization for pineapple grown in Sawah Baru, Darmaga, Bogor. The research was conducted using split plot randomized block design with fi ve <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> status as main plots i. e. 0, 70, 140, 210, and 280 kg K 2 O ha- 1 representing status levels of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, respectively. The sub plot was dosage of K fertilizer i. e. 0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 kg K 2 O ha- 1. The result of the research showed that plant growth and production of pineapple were improved by <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> nutrient status and dosage of K application. The level of <b>soil</b> <b>K</b> nutrient availability was classifi ed into low ( 50 ppm K 2 O).

40|$|Saturated {{hydraulic}} conductivity (Ks) {{is an important}} variable in hydrological cycle processes. Determination of <b>Ks</b> in <b>soils</b> is a difficult and time consuming process. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine <b>Ks</b> in <b>soils</b> by pedotransfer (PTF) models derived using soil moisture constants and physical properties. Ks values were determined in 30 different soil samples using constant head permeability method. According to path analyses results, direct effects of some <b>soil</b> properties on <b>Ks</b> in <b>soils</b> were in the following order; permanent wilting point (PWP) > bulk density (BD) > clay (C) > silt (Si) > field capacity (FC). Soil physical properties generally had the highest indirect effects on Ks through PWP. Prediction of Ks by the second order PTF models was significant using only C, Si and DB (r= 0. 868 **) and using only FC and PWP (r= 0. 796 **) in the models. Using moisture constants with the other soil physical properties in the second order PTF model increased significance level of the relation between predicted and measured values of Ks (r= 0. 955 **). Besides soil physical properties, having moisture constants in PTF models showed that saturated Ks values can be predicted more accurately in soils having similar physical boundary conditions such as texture, bulk density etc...|$|R
