5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to <b>its</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

25|$|The first miRNA was {{discovered}} in 1993 by a group led by Ambros and including Lee and Feinbaum; but additional insight into <b>its</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> required simultaneously published work by Ruvkun's team, including Wightman and Ha. These groups published back-to-back papers on the lin-4 gene, which was known to control the timing of C. elegans larval development by repressing the lin-14 gene. When Lee et al. isolated the lin-4 gene, they found that instead of producing an mRNA encoding a protein, it produced short non-coding RNAs, {{one of which was}} a ~22-nucleotide RNA that contained sequences partially complementary to multiple sequences in the 3' UTR of the lin-14 mRNA. This complementarity was proposed to inhibit the translation of the lin-14 mRNA into the LIN-14 protein. At the time, the lin-4 small RNA was thought to be a nematode idiosyncrasy.|$|E
2500|$|Polyhistidine-tagging is {{the option}} of choice for purifying {{recombinant}} proteins in denaturing conditions because <b>its</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is dependent only on the primary structure of proteins.

More studies are necessary to better test this treatment, assess <b>its</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and test the hypothesis suggesting that particular patients subgroups might be more susceptible to this treatment than others.

6000|$|Reason is not {{the faculty}} of the finite. But here I must premise the following. The faculty of the finite is that which reduces the {{confused}} impressions of sense to their essential forms,--quantity, quality, relation, and in these action and reaction, cause and effect, and the like; thus raises the materials furnished by the senses and sensations into objects of reflection, and so makes experience possible. Without it, man's representative powers would be a delirium, a chaos, a scudding cloudage of shapes; and it is therefore most appropriately called the understanding, or substantiative faculty. Our elder metaphysicians, down to Hobbes inclusively, called this likewise discourse, 'discursus, discursio,' from <b>its</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> as not staying at any one object, but running as it were to and fro to abstract, generalize, and classify. Now when this faculty is employed {{in the service of the}} pure reason, it brings out the necessary and universal truths contained in the infinite into distinct contemplation by the pure act of the sensuous imagination, that is, in the production of the forms of space and time abstracted from all corporeity, and likewise of the inherent forms of the understanding itself abstractedly from the consideration of particulars, as in the case of geometry, numeral mathematics, universal logic, and pure metaphysics. The discursive faculty then becomes what our Shakspeare with happy precision calls [...] "discourse of reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why was it {{that the}} 'Origin of Species' possessed this {{extraordinary}} vitalising and kinetic power, this germinal energy, this contagious force, beyond all other forms of evolutionism previously promulgated? Why did the world, that listened so coldly to Lamarck and Chambers, turn so ready an ear to Charles Darwin and natural selection? Partly, no doubt, because in the fulness of time the moment had come and the prophet had arisen. All great movements are long brewing, and burst out at last (like the Reformation and the French Revolution) with explosive energy. But the cause is largely to be found, also, I believe, in the peculiar nature of the Darwinian solution. True, a thoroughly logical mind, a mind of the very highest order, would have said even before Darwin, 'Creation can have no possible place in the physical series of things at all. How organisms came to be I do not yet exactly see; but I am sure they must {{have come to be}} by some merely physical process, if we could only find it out.' And such minds were all actually evolutionary even before Darwin had made the modus operandi of evolution intelligible. But most people are not so clear-sighted. They require to have everything proved to them by the strictest collocation of actual instances. They will not believe unless one rise from the dead. There are men who rejected the raw doctrine of special creation on evidence adduced; and there are men who never even for a moment entertained it as conceivable. The former compose the mass of the scientific world, and it was for their conversion that the Darwinian hypothesis was so highly salutary. As Professor Fiske rightly remarks, 'The truth is that before the publication of the [...] "Origin of Species" [...] there was no opinion whatever current respecting the subject that deserved to be called a scientific hypothesis. That the more complex forms of life must have come into existence through some process of development from simpler forms was no doubt the only sensible and rational view to take of the subject; but in a vague and general opinion of this sort there is nothing that is properly scientific. A scientific hypothesis must connect the phenomena with which it deals by alleging a [...] "true cause;" [...] and before 1859 no one had suggested a [...] "true cause" [...] for the origination of new species, although the problem was one over which every philosophical naturalist had puzzled {{since the beginning of the}} century. This explains why Mr. Darwin's success was so rapid and complete, and it also explains why he came so near being anticipated.' To put it briefly, a priori, creation is from the very first unbelievable; but, as a matter of evidence, Lamarck failed to make evolution comprehensible, or to give a rationale of <b>its</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> while Darwin's theory of natural selection succeeded in doing so for those who awaited a posteriori proof. Hence Darwin was able to convert the world, where Lamarck had only been able to stir up enquiry among the picked spirits of the scientific and philosophical coterie. Therein lies the true secret of his rapid, his brilliant, and his triumphant progress. He had found out not only that it was so, but how it was so, too. In Aristotelian phrase, he had discovered the πῶς as well as the ὅτι.|$|E

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} Brca 1 {{plays an}} important role in protecting mammalian cells against genomic instability, but little is known about <b>its</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In this work we demonstrate that recombinant human Brca 1 protein binds strongly to DNA, an activity conferred by a domain in the center of the Brca 1 polypeptide. As a result of this binding, Brca 1 inhibits the nucleolytic activities of the Mre 11 /Rad 50 /Nbs 1 complex, an enzyme implicated in numerous aspects of double-strand break repair. Brca 1 displays a preference for branched DNA structures and forms protein–DNA complexes cooperatively between multiple DNA strands, but without DNA sequence specificity.
