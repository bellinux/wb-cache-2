40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the complex {{relationship}} Charlotte Brontë s novels have with Europe. It will examine how religion, sexuality and morality, and language are used {{in order to create}} a British identity that is contrasted to a European one, but also how these binaries are broken down via the romantic unions of British and European characters and the appeal of certain aspects of Catholicism, European sexuality and the French language. The role of Europe has often been overlooked in favour of the British Empire in Brontë scholarship, and this thesis posits that Europe is integral to the establishment of a British national identity in Brontë s works. Furthermore, those who have studied the author s presentation of Europe have often limited themselves to the two novels that are set on the Continent, but I argue that much is lost in disregarding the remainder of Brontë s works. The findings of this thesis suggest that despite the rampant <b>Europhobia</b> found in Brontë s works, these novels stand out amongst their contemporaries in envisaging romantic unions between Britons and Europeans and that the British characters need something, or someone, European in order to be fulfilled. However, though the novels ask the question whether there is any room for Europe in the British national identity Brontë constructs, Britain is ultimately victorious in the battle between the two...|$|E
40|$|As the {{widening}} and deepening of the European Union continues in earnest, {{there are an}} ever-increasing number of issues for Eurosceptic elites in England to attack. This paper posits that political elites and the media frame issues {{in order to create}} Euroscepticism among the masses. This tactic is taken by political elites in a bid to gain electoral support. On the other hand, the media use Euroscepticism as a way to increase profits. In the 2004 European Parliament elections, the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) benefited from rising Euroscepticism among the British public that has been carefully crafted by both Conservative and Labour elites {{since the beginning of the}} European project in 1951. A determination of the substantive issues that have consolidated the level of support for this Eurosceptic mentality in the last five years will be made by answering some pertinent questions. Is Euroscepticism a viable party platform in British mainstream politics today? Has the implementation of popularly-supported devolution in both Scotland and Wales made the English more aware of their distinct identity? Do members of the general public who identify themselves as English actually have a tendency to support Eurosceptic candidates and parties and purchase Eurosceptic newspapers? A survey of party elites from across the political spectrum is utilized to shed light on this escalating Euroscepticism. In the end, while the United Kingdom is not the only country facing increased <b>Europhobia,</b> the impact of framing by political elites and the media may force the Labour Party to rethink its strategy of deeper integration but, hopefully, will not lead to a pullout from the EU...|$|E
40|$|Onychomycosis is a stigmatizing {{condition}} whose {{management is}} associated with a number of problems including poor prognosis due to the nature and etiology of the disease, limited effective antifungal agents, side effects of the antifungal agents and resistance of the causative agents towards antifungal agents. Furthermore the patients require longer exposure to these antifungal agents making management of the disease expensive. All the this necessitated investigating the g effectiveness of the latex of the plant <b>Europhobia</b> cotinifolin populary used in Kilimanjaro and _ Dar es Salaam Regions for this condition] The specific objectives of the study were to screen the methanolic extracts and plant latex for antifungal activity, to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations, to carry out a brine shrimp lethality test and establish the TLC profile for the extracts and latex. Disc diffusion method was used to screen for antifungal activity of latex and methanolic extracts U of the leaf and stem bark against Trichophyron rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. The Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth microdillution method. The TLC profile on silica plates was established by determining the “appropriate solvent system by polarity adjustment. The Brine shrimp lethality was determined by using modified Mayer et al., 1982 method The leave extract displayed more antifungal activity on the tested fungi when compared to the to stem bark extracts while the latex lacked the activity. The MIC of the leaves extract was 2. 5 ug/ml for Trichophyron mentagrophytes and Aspergillus niger, the stem bark extract had MC‘ of 2. 5 ug/ml for. Trichophyron mentagrophytes Regarding brine shrimp test, the extracts showed high activity with LC 50 of lo. 7 ugf 1 nl and l' 7. 057 ug/ml for the leaf extract and stem extracts respectively. It can be concluded that the latex popularly used to treat onychornycosis lacks antifungal activity though the extracts were able to display activity against some of the tested fungi. However, the plant displayed a strong cytotoxic effect. It is therefore recommended that further studies should be done in regard to the cytotoxic activity involving several cell lines...|$|E
