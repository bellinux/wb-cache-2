40|$|IntroductionIn 2005, {{representatives from}} the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention partnered with the National Business <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> <b>Health</b> and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to form a work group for {{developing}} A Purchaser’s Guide to Clinical Preventive Services: Moving Science into Coverage. This guide, designed {{as a tool for}} employers, describes recommended clinical preventive services for 46 conditions. The guide includes the scientific evidence and benefits language that employers need to include comprehensive clinical preventive services in their medical benefit plans. MethodsThe work group determined that the guide would address conditions that 1) affected {{a large percentage of the}} working population, 2) were costly to control, and 3) had well-defined and accepted recommendations for preventive services. Subject matter experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Business <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> <b>Health,</b> and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality developed or reviewed statements of scientific evidence for 46 diseases and conditions. ResultsThe Purchaser’s Guide, written for an employer audience, includes descriptions for recommended clinical preventive services and their cost savings, syntheses of supporting evidence, strategies for prioritization, and recommendations to improve the delivery and use of preventive services. Twelve hundred copies were sent to more than 275 members of the National Business <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> <b>Health</b> and other purchasers of health care; training sessions on the Guide were held for 228 business leaders, health benefit consultants, and health plan administrators; and an online version was created through the Web sites of the National Business <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> <b>Health</b> and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The online version has received more than 260, 000 hits since its release. ConclusionIn 2007, the National Business <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> <b>Health</b> reported that some Fortune 500 companies will be using the Purchaser’s Guide when negotiating their health benefit contracts and developing their health care strategies. Further research is under way to determine whether the Guide influences employers to purchase recommended clinical preventive services...|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in America today. The {{potential}} onset of cardiovascular disease in the fourth decade for men and fifth decade for women, underscores the scope of the health problem, as the population grows older. Twenty-three percent of men and thirty percent of women who survive a myocardial infarction will have a recurrence within six months. Patients with coronary artery bypass grafts are more susceptible to progressive stenosis from atherosclerosis than native vessels. Secondary prevention through physical activity is recommended by the AHA to reduce the occurrence of these events, requiring expensive re-intervention. However, less than one half of those eligible for cardiac rehabilitation enroll. ^ The purpose of this study is to examine whether cardiac rehabilitation or home-walking with or without nurse telephone support will affect cardiac recovery. A convenience sample of sixty-three cardiac patients self-selected a cardiac rehabilitation (comparison) program in this quasi-experimental research design. One hundred twenty-six surgical cardiac patients were randomized to a home-walking or control <b>group.</b> MANCOVA tests <b>on</b> <b>health</b> status, self-efficacy, and diastolic blood pressure revealed significant differences for the main effect of <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>health</b> status, self-efficacy, and diastolic blood pressure (F = 3. 980, 16, 647, 6. 562, p =. 020,. 000,. 011), while controlling for pre-self-efficacy, medical diagnosis, and age. Post hoc tests showed no significant difference between the cardiac rehabilitation and home-walking <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>health</b> status (p =. 485) and self-efficacy scales (p =. 285). No significant difference was found between the home-walking and control <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>health</b> status (p =. 241). A significant difference was found between the cardiac rehabilitation and control <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> all three dependent variables, respectively (p =. 016,. 000,. 000). The home-walking group revealed a significant difference on self-efficacy from the control group (p =. 000). Additional findings include significant differences between home-walking and control <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> physical function (F = 7. 3354, p =. 0009) and mental health (F = 4. 3659, p =. 0140). The findings indicate that a home-walking program could be a comparable alternative to a cardiac rehabilitation group by improving self-efficacy and health status and lowering blood pressure. ...|$|R

40|$|In Italy, the {{introduction}} of Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) has been decided but postponed, as a national programme, until 2015, when data from Regions which have already implemented it will be available. Starting from 2003, eight Italian Regions (Basilicata, Calabria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Apulia, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany and Veneto) have progressively introduced UVV, in their immunization programme, with different schedules in children aged 13 - 15 months and 5 - 6 years, currently a two-dose schedule is adopted by all Regions. In June 2013, an <b>Interregional</b> <b>Group</b> <b>on</b> Varicella Vaccination (IGVV) {{has been established in}} order to assess the effectiveness of varicella vaccination with standardized and shared tools. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of varicella vaccination on the incidence and hospitalizations due to varicella and its complications in the period 2003 - 2012 in order to support the Italian decision makers on the future national adoption. Preliminary data showed that a general reduction of incidence and hospitalization rates was observed in the study period, resulting in relevant savings for the National Health Service. Immunization coverage with first dose at 24 months of age was high in all Regions (84 %- 95 %) in 2012. Adverse events due to varicella vaccines were rare and without permanent sequelae. Underreporting of varicella cases and delays in the administration of the first dose of varicella vaccines were the main critical issues. In conclusion, solid evidences in support of universal UVV arise from the experiences available today in Italy...|$|R
