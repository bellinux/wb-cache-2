40|$|A {{clearance}} {{control apparatus}} has a positioning mechanism for controlling clearance between rotor blade tips and a shroud segment {{of a gas}} turbine engine casing. The positioning mechanism {{is supported by the}} casing, coupled to the shroud segment, and actuatable for moving the shroud segment toward and away from the rotor blade tips to reach a position at which a desired clearance is established. The mechanism includes a shaft and a bellcrank actuating assembly. The shaft is mounted through a passage defined by a mounting structure on the casing for radial movement along a longitudinal axis of the shaft toward and away from the rotor axis and is coupled at its inner end to the shroud segment. The bellcrank actuating assembly is coupled to an outer end of the shaft and mounted to the casing adjacent the shaft for pivotal movement about an axis spaced from and <b>extending</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the longitudinal axis of the shaft. The pivotal movement of the bellcrank actuating assembly produces radial movement of the shaft and shroud segment therewith toward and away from the rotor blade tips...|$|E
40|$|The enamel {{of human}} teeth is {{generally}} regarded as a brittle material with low fracture toughness. Consequently, the contributions of this tissue in resisting tooth fracture {{and the importance of}} its complex microstructure have been largely overlooked. The primary objective of this dissertation is to characterize the role of enamel's microstructure and degree of decussation on the fracture behavior of human enamel. The importance of the protein content and aging on the fracture toughness of enamel were also explored. Incremental crack growth in sections of human enamel was achieved using a special inset Compact Tension (CT) specimen configuration. Crack extension was achieved in two orthogonal directions, i. e. longitudinal and transverse to the prism axes. Fracture surfaces and the path of crack growth path were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand the fundamental mechanisms of crack growth extension. Furthermore, a hybrid approach was adopted to quantify the contribution of toughening mechanisms to the overall toughness. Results of this investigations showed that human enamel exhibits rising R-curve for both directions of crack extension. Cracks <b>extending</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the rods in the outer enamel achieved lower rise in toughness with crack extension, and significantly lower toughness (1. 23 � 0. 20 MPa*m 0. 5) than in the inner enamel (1. 96 � 0. 28 MPa*m 0. 5) and in the longitudinal direction (2. 01 � 0. 21 MPa*m 0. 5). The crack growth resistance exhibited both anisotropy and inhomogeneity, which arise from the complex hierarchical microstructure and the decussated prism structure. Decussation causes deflection of cracks extending from the enamel surface inwards, and facilitates a continuation of transverse crack extension within the outer enamel. This process dissipates fracture energy and averts cracks from extending toward the dentin and vital pulp. This study is the first to investigate the importance of proteins and the effect of aging on the fracture resistance of this highly mineralized tissue. Results showed that although the organic content is small, it {{plays an important role in}} the toughness of enamel. The deproteinized enamel underwent a significant reduction in the crack growth resistance with respect to proteinized control, with fracture toughness in the longitudinal (1. 24 � 0. 24 MPa*m 0. 5) and transverse directions (0. 95 � 0. 20 MPa*m 0. 5) approximately 40 % lower than the control. Removal of the proteins also resulted in a loss of anisotropy, which reduces enamel's unique ability to invoke crack deflection. Additionally, results showed that aging results in a significant reduction in the fracture toughness. In the longitudinal direction the fracture toughness of old enamel was 1. 38 � 0. 35 MPa*m 0. 5, which is more than 30 % lower than that of the control. Microscopic observation of crack extension in the enamel specimens showed that crack growth toughening occurred by a combination of extrinsic toughening mechanism including crack bridging, crack deflection and crack bifurcation. The cohesive zone analysis confirmed that enamel is primarily extrinsically toughened, with intrinsic and extrinsic toughening contributing approximately 5 % and 30 % of the total energy to fracture in the decussated enamel, respectively. However, the contribution of the extrinsic toughening in the outer enamel was negligible. For the deproteinized and old enamel, the degree of extrinsic toughening was 75 %, and 30 % lower, respectively, in comparison to the young proteinized enamel. The degradation in extrinsic toughening was attributed to embrittlement of the bridging ligaments. The organic substance at the rod boundaries was found to be essential in the crack growth toughening of enamel through the formation of unbroken ligaments and crack bridging, microcracking along the rod boundaries and in the process of crack bifurcation. The effectiveness of these mechanisms is most dominant in the decussated enamel due to the higher organic content. Through these findings the present investigation provides new understanding on the fracture resistance of enamel, which is essential to advancements in the field of restorative dentistry, as well as in the design of new restorative and bio-inspired materials...|$|E
40|$|We report {{measurements}} in a 2 -dimensional, gravity-driven, collisional, granular flow of {{the normal}} force delivered {{to the wall and}} of particle velocity at several points in the flow. The wall force and the flow velocity are negatively correlated. This correlation falls off only slowly with distance <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the flow, but dies away on the scale of a few particle diameters upstream or downstream. The data support a picture of short-lived chains of frequently colliding particles that <b>extend</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>to</b> the flow direction, making transient load-bearing bridges that cause bulk fluctuations in the flow velocity. The time-dependence of these spatial correlation functions indicate that while the force-bearing structures are local in space, their influence extends far upstream in the flow, albeit with a time-lag. This leads to correlated velocity fluctuations, whose spatial range increases as the jamming threshold is approached. Comment: to be submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{recently}} proposed perturbative numerical renormalization-group algorithm, we explore {{the connection between}} quantum criticality {{and the emergence of}} Luttinger liquid physics in t–J chains coupled by frustrated interactions. This study is built on an earlier finding that at the maximally frustrated point the ground state of weakly coupled Heisenberg chains is disordered, with the transverse exchanges being irrelevant. This result is <b>extended</b> here <b>to</b> <b>transverse</b> couplings up <b>to,</b> and we argue that it may also be valid at the isotropic point. A finite size analysis of coupled Heisenberg chains {{in the vicinity of the}} maximally frustrated point confirms that the transverse spin–spin correlations decay exponentially while the longitudinal ones revert to those of decoupled chains. We find that this behaviour persists upon moderate hole doping. For larger doping, the frustration becomes inactive and the quantum critical point is suppressed...|$|R

We show that in the light-cone gauge, TMD PDFs contain UV divergences that {{may be attributed to}} the renormalization effect on a cusp-like junction point of the gauge contours at infinity. In order to eliminate the anomalous dimension ensuing from this cusp, we propose to use in the definition of the TMD PDFs, a soft counter term in terms of a path-ordered phase factor along a particular cusped contour <b>extending</b> <b>to</b> <b>transverse</b> light-cone infinity and comprising light-like and transverse segments.
