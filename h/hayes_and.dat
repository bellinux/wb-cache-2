Hayes then strangled Jennifer, doused her lifeless body and parts of the house, including the daughters' rooms, with gasoline.

5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American Indian policy, {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. <b>Hayes</b> <b>and</b> Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to self-sufficiency and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. <b>Hayes</b> <b>and</b> Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game.

A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led to Danny Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E
