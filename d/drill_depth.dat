5000|$|Deepwater Horizon was a {{floating}} semi-submersible drilling unit — a fifth-generation, ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, column-stabilized drilling rig owned by Transocean and built in South Korea. The platform was 396 ft long and 256 ft wide and could operate in waters up to 8000 ft deep, {{to a maximum}} <b>drill</b> <b>depth</b> of 30000 ft. Press releases from Transocean state the platform had historically been used for deeper wells, including the deepest underwater gas and oil well in history at 35055 ft in 2009. [...] The $560 million platform was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and completed in 2001. It was owned by Transocean, operated under the Marshalese flag of convenience, and was under lease to BP until September 2013. At {{the time of the}} explosion, the Deepwater Horizon was on Mississippi Canyon Block 252, referred to as the Macondo Prospect, in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 41 mi off the Louisiana coast. In March 2008, the mineral rights to drill for oil on the Macondo Prospect were purchased by BP at the Minerals Management Service's lease sale. The platform commenced drilling in February 2010 at a water depth of approximately 5000 ft. At the time of the explosion the rig was drilling an exploratory well. [...] The planned well was to be drilled to 18360 ft below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer. Production casing was being run and cemented {{at the time of the}} accident. Once the cementing was complete, it was due to be tested for integrity and a cement plug set to temporarily abandon the well.|$|E

The usage, problems, processing and efficiency of this system in a mining environment is also explored. It also looks at the level of accuracies provided by this system. Before the introduction of RTK GPS into the blasting process, the current blast fragmentation was resulting in sub-optimal feed size to crushers on the Mine and an unfriendly floor conditions resulting in excessive sheeting of digging floor to prevent tyre damage. It was decided to use RTK GPS to improve the fragmentation through accurate <b>drill</b> <b>depth</b> and design pattern in order to achieve a constant throughput to the north heap leach crusher of 1500 t/hr, a 5 % increase in pit loading efficiency and a 50 % decrease in rock breaker hours, equipment damage costs and in-pit sheeting costs respectively.

40|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, {{water jet}} drilling provides several advantages over classic drilling with rigid drilling bits, such as the always sharp cut, absence of thermal damage and increased manoeuvrability. Previous research showed that the heterogeneity of bone tissue can cause variation in <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> whilst {{water jet drilling}}. To improve control over the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth,</b> a new method is tested consisting of two water jets that collide directly below the bone surface. The expected working principle is that after collision the jets will disintegrate, with the result of eliminating the destructive power of the coherent jets and leaving the bone tissue underneath the focal point intact. To assess the working principle of colliding water jets (CWJ), the influence of inhomogeneity of the bone tissue on the variation of the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> {{and the impact of}} jet time (t(wj)) on the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> were compared to a single water jet (SWJ) with a similar power. 98 holes were drilled in 14 submerged porcine tali with two conditions CWJ (impact angle of 30 degrees and 90 degrees) and SWJ. The water pressure was 70 MPa for all conditions. The water jet diameter was 0. 3 mm for CWJ and 0. 4 mm for SWJ. t(wj) was set at 1, 3, 5 and 8 s. <b>Drilling</b> <b>depth</b> and hole diameter were measured using microCT scans. A non-parametric Levene's test was performed to assess a significant difference in variance between conditions SWJ and CWJ. A regression analysis was used to determine differences in influence of t(wj) on the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth.</b> Hole diameter differences were assessed using a one way Anova. A significance level of p < 0. 05 was set. Condition CWJ significantly decreases the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> variance caused by the heterogeneity of the bone when compared to SWJ. The mean depth for CWJ was 0. 9 mm (SD 0. 3 mm) versus 4. 8 mm (SD 2. 0) for SWJ. t(wj) affects the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> less for condition CWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 30) than for SWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 46). The impact angle (30 degrees or 90 degrees) of the CWJ does not influence the <b>drilling</b> <b>depth</b> nor the variation in depth. The diameters of the resulting holes {{in the direction of the}} jets is significantly larger for CWJ at 90 degrees than for 30 degrees or a single jet. This study shows that CWJ provides accurate depth control when water jet drilling in an inhomogeneous material such as bone. The maximum variance measured by using the 95 % confidence interval is 0. 6 mm opposed to 5. 4 mm for SWJ. This variance is smaller than the accuracy required for bone debridement treatments (2 - 4 mm deep) or drilling pilot holes. This confirms that the use of CWJ is an inherently safe method that can be used to accurately drill in bone...|$|R

To assure a good drilling quality, the vibration variation on the drill tips during high speed drilling is needed to be investigated. A pre-twisted beam is used to simulate the drill.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} provision of immediate implant-supported auricular prosthesis using surgical navigation and CAD/CAM technology. Methods & Materials: A stereomodel was generated by rapid-prototyping (RP) based on the CT Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data set of a patient with a defective right auricle. By using the RP software, a mirrored image of the contralateral intact ear was produced and used for implant planning. The thickness of overlying soft tissues at the defect side was also measured by the software. The surgical field was then defined and a disc of 120 mm in diameter, centred at the external acoustic meatus, was segmented out from the stereomodel {{according to the data}} measured to simulate the mastoid bone. The defect was filled with a translucent silicone material to simulate the skin. A silicone mould of the mirrored ear was fabricated by RP. A wax pattern was produced from the mould and the silicone ear was processed with a housing made of acrylic resin. During operation, a silicone flap was raised and two dummy implants were inserted as planned using the surgical navigation system. The flap was thinned and closed. After the post-operative CT was taken, appropriate abutments were selected and inserted into the implants. Magnets were placed on the abutments and picked up by the acrylic housing inside the silicone ear with cold-cured acrylic resin. The data of the post-operative CT were compared with the planned trajectories by image fusion technique using surgical navigation software. <b>Drill</b> <b>depth,</b> angle in axial and coronal plane, and entry point position of each implant were measured.
