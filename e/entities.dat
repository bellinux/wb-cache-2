As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose <b>entities.</b> However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose <b>entities</b> were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose <b>entities</b> that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} <b>entities</b> is the view that that class of <b>entities</b> does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern {{physicists}} are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental <b>entities</b> that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose <b>entities.</b> By hedging its risks with special purpose <b>entities</b> which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions.

Internal information of <b>entity</b> name like family name, first name in person name, feature word in place name and organization name do not needed. Through <b>entity</b> name guessing based on context keywords, pre-identification is realized. Definition of bidirectional potential <b>entity</b> name recognition, rough confirmation of potential <b>entity</b> name, segmentation word is proposed. To solve the possible ambiguity in <b>entity</b> name identification, {{the degree of}} segmentation and conjunction is presented as well as cascade recognition and final confirmation. Combining with this pre-processing method, performance will be improved by using internal information of <b>entity</b> name. Experiment proves that the method have a special advantage in recognition special <b>entity</b> name, ambiguity name and irregular name. In this paper, Chinese person name is taken as an example for <b>entity</b> name recognition. Nevertheless, the method is not limit to person name recognition but also a pre-identification method for other <b>entity</b> name. Index Terms—named <b>entity</b> recognition, potential entit...|$|R
