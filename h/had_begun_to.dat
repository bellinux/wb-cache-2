Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River <b>had</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents {{were not allowed to}} return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
