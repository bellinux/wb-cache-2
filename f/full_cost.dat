40|$|In {{this paper}} we perform a {{mathematical}} analyse of {{profits and losses}} in direct and <b>full</b> <b>costing.</b> They are compared in different situations, mainly the utilisation of productive capacity {{and the existence of}} beginning inventories. Direct costing was conceived as a system of cost accounting which would show profits as a function of sales. In <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> profits depend on available combinations of sales, production, costs of beginning inventories, etc., and information displayed in financial statements display appears incongruent. Differences in profits with <b>full</b> and direct <b>costing</b> increase when <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> allocates fixed costs according to normal production, in some cases differences, and financial statements would show more incongruent performance.

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E
5|$|The Cacchios {{expressed}} a desire to sell the Theatre to the RTC rather than to developers, because the RTC consisted of friends of the family and other residents whom the Cacchios trusted to maintain and preserve the Theatre. To make the transfer of ownership easier, the Cacchios agreed to continue operating the Theatre until such a deal could be reached, and to assist in the operation of the Theatre after its sale to the RTC. By late February 2010 the RTC had raised $45,000, and needed to reach a total of $600,000. After a down payment of $160,000, and paying the <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> of the property, the remaining funds would cover renovations to the building. Over $8,000 was raised in a silent auction on February28. More than 100 people attended the auction, including Congressman Maurice Hinchey.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{possibilities and}} constraints for {{implementation of the}} Activity Based Costing (ABC) method, as a <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> method, at European universities. We investigated the current practice and trends in developing the cost allocation method at universities in the European Union. Precisely, we analyzed trends and current movements at universities in the EU countries and the major problems in setting the ABC method at a university. By using this information, we proposed guidelines {{for the development of}} a <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> system at the University of Zagreb that is based on the following parameters: categories of costs, main activities, cost objects and cost drivers. Our paper shows that despite public demands for efficient managing within universities, still, a very small percentage of universities has implemented <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> systems. The most important obstacles for that are: resistance to change, non-reliable data in current account systems, lack of management will and legal barriers. Furthermore, our paper explains that one of the challenges involved in implementing <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> systems seems to be the fact that universities are still income oriented than cost oriented. Nevertheless, positive trends in implementing a <b>full</b> <b>costing</b> method, respectively the ABC method, are obvious. We highlighted universities in Portugal and Liverpool as universities that have successfully implemented the ABC method as well as all drivers, barriers and benefits that came out from that implementation...|$|R

Immediately after the storm, the Salvation Army began collecting and distributing donated clothing, while providing hot meals to hundreds of destitute storm victims. Australian Prime Minister William McMahon soon traveled to Townsville to assess the damage and authorise the distribution of emergency grants for affected residents. At the end of December, officials announced that {{the state and federal}} governments would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants, ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,000 for pensioners; for the latter, higher allocations to cover the <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> of rebuilding homes were soon considered. The Townsville City Council received a special $25,000 grant with the goal of repairing schools {{for the start of the}} new academic year. By 27 December, $150,000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout Queensland sought assistance for the disaster area. Western Australia provided $72,000 of relief funding, while Tasmania contributed $2,000. The Australian federal government reimbursed Queensland for an estimated $5.5–6 million spent by the state on recovery.|$|E

Although the current tariff structure does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors.
