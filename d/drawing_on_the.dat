5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E

Although he was defeated in 841 in battle with Niall Caille of the Cenél nEógain, the High King according to some, Feidlimid's achievements were exceptional. Not since Congal Cáech of the Dál nAraidi, King of Ulaid in the early 7th century, had any king but an Uí Néill one been reckoned King of Tara in any account.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Fear of Music in 1979, Talking Heads and Eno sought to make an album that would dispel notions of {{the group as a}} mere vehicle for {{frontman}} and chief lyricist David Byrne. <b>Drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the group experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of sampled and looped grooves, an innovative technique at the time. Recording sessions also incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell.|$|E
5|$|George Vernadsky {{proposed}} that Oleg of Novgorod was the donkey-riding {{chief of the}} Rus' who attacked Bardha'a. Vernadsky identified Oleg with Helgu, a figure mentioned in the Schechter Letter.

5|$|Ideas for Dishonored 2 began while {{developing}} the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned {{the decision to}} create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, only a child in Dishonored, was first proposed as a playable character. The game's aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the new fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented {{over the course of}} one year.

5|$|The {{earliest}} written references {{that have}} survived {{relating to the}} islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he states that there are 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150AD, Ptolemy, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earlier naval expeditions of Agricola, writes that there are five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna. Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and Hæbudes.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.

5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued {{that they would have to}} have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Edward VIII did {{not spend}} much of his reign at Windsor Castle. He {{continued}} {{to spend most of}} his time at Fort Belvedere in the Great Park, where he had lived whilst Prince of Wales. Edward created a small aerodrome at the castle on Smith's Lawn, now used as a golf-course. Edward's reign was short-lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the British Empire from the castle in December 1936, adopting the title of Duke of Windsor. His successor, George VI also preferred his own original home, the Royal Lodge in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth. As king, George revived the annual Garter Service at Windsor, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> accounts of the 17th-century ceremonies recorded by Elias Ashmole, but moving the event to Ascot Week in June.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century, castles became tourist attractions. Blair Castle was a popular {{location}} on account of its landscaped gardens, and Stirling Castle because of its romantic historic connections. Tours became increasingly popular during the nineteenth century, usually starting at Edinburgh and then spending up to two weeks further north, {{taking advantage of the}} expanding rail and steamer network. Blair Castle remained popular, but additional castles joined the circuit, with Cawdor Castle becoming popular once the railway line reached north to Fort William. Scottish castle guidebooks became well known for providing long historical accounts of their sites, often <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plots of Romantic novels for the details. Sir Walter Scott's novels set in Scotland popularised several northern castles, including Tantallon, which was featured in the poem Marmion (1808).|$|E
5|$|Joehana {{appears to}} have been {{familiar}} with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana. Wayang characters such as the clown Cepot are referred to in his writings, and he draws on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques, such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances. However, there are significant shifts. His writings depart from the traditional forms of literature such as wawacan, instead embracing the novel, a European literary form. Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature, Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese. The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages, and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese; some Dutch (the language of the colonial government) is mixed in.|$|E
5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries saw a {{small number}} of British castles develop into still grander structures, often <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance views on {{architecture}} that were increasing in popularity on the continent. Tower keeps, large solid keeps used for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread with the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps at Wardour, Tattershall and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England castles began to be built in brick, with Caister, Kirby Muxloe and Tattershall forming examples of this new style. North of the border the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 picked up on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable castle, guarded by a gun park.|$|E

5|$|This traditional, {{historical}} {{portrayal of}} the North-West Mounted Police influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor's history {{to build their own}} status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organisation formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to the foundation of the mounted police in 1873, rather than, for example, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dominion Police's foundation date of 1868. The RCMP's centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted police in line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force's role in shaping the evolution of a liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to avoid}} war, Tsar Peter sent his two sons, Boris and Roman, as hostages to Constantinople. This move failed to appease Nikephoros, {{but he was}} not able or willing to {{campaign}} against Bulgaria; his forces were engaged in the East, and furthermore, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines' past experience, Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria. Consequently, he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient of calling in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria. In late 966 or early 967, he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros, a citizen of Cherson, as his ambassador to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus'. The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus', with whom they were bound by treaty. With promises of rich rewards and, according to Leo the Deacon, a payment of 1,500pounds of gold, the Rus' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north. That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual, since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks. The historian A.D. Stokes, who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, suggested that this move had a second motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav, who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate, away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, <b>drawing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E
