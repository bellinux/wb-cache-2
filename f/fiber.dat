Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; <b>fiber</b> optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current <b>fiber</b> optic lines are unused dark <b>fiber,</b> sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing <b>fiber</b> optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Glass <b>fiber</b> has {{increased}} in popularity since the discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. However, the safety of glass <b>fiber</b> is also being called into question, as {{research shows that the}} composition of this material (asbestos and glass <b>fiber</b> are both silicate fibers) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon <b>fiber,</b> glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the <b>fiber,</b> the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the <b>fiber</b> will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a <b>fiber.</b>|$|E

50|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{composed}} of long cylindrical cells called muscle <b>fibers.</b> There {{are two types of}} muscle <b>fibers,</b> slow twitch or muscle contraction (type I) and fast twitch (type II). Slow twitch <b>fibers</b> are more efficient in using oxygen to generate energy, while fast twitch <b>fibers</b> are less efficient. However, fast twitch <b>fibers</b> fire more rapidly and generate more force. Fast twitch <b>fibers</b> and slow twitch <b>fibers</b> are also called white muscle <b>fibers</b> and red muscles <b>fibers,</b> respectively.|$|R

5|$|Glass <b>fiber</b> {{is formed}} when thin strands of silica-based or other {{formulation}} glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers {{has been known}} for millennia; however, the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all glass <b>fiber</b> had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of <b>fiber).</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based <b>fiber</b> systems. all factors of the <b>fiber</b> must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium <b>fiber</b> parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the <b>fiber,</b> and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of modern technologies demands {{the creation of}} new nonmetallic, fibrous materials with specific properties. The <b>fibers</b> and materials developed by NII 'Chimvolokno', St. Petersburg, can be divided into two groups. The first group includes heat-resistant <b>fibers,</b> fire-resistant <b>fibers,</b> thermotropic <b>fibers,</b> <b>fibers</b> for medical application, and textile structures. The second group contains refractory <b>fibers,</b> chemoresistant and antifriction <b>fibers,</b> <b>fibers</b> on the basis of polyvinyl alcohol, microfiltering films, and paperlike and nonwoven materials. In cooperation with NPO 'Chimvolokno' MYTITSHI, we developed and started producing heat-resistant high-strength <b>fibers</b> on the base of polyhetarearilin and aromatic polyimides (SVM and terlon); heat-resistant <b>fibers</b> on the base of polyemede (aramid); fire-retardant <b>fibers</b> (togilen); chemoresistant and antifriction <b>fibers</b> on the basis of homo and copolymers of polytetrafluoroethylene (polyfen and ftorin); and water soluble, acetylated, and high-modulus <b>fibers</b> from polyvinyl alcohol (vylen). Separate reports will deal with textile structures and thermotropic <b>fibers,</b> as well as with medical <b>fibers.</b> One of the groups of refractory <b>fibers</b> carbon <b>fibers</b> (CF) and the corresponding paperlike nonwoven materials are discussed in detail.

25|$|<b>Fiber</b> with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode <b>fiber.</b> As an optical waveguide, the <b>fiber</b> supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the <b>fiber.</b> <b>Fiber</b> supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode <b>fiber.</b> The behavior of larger-core multi-mode <b>fiber</b> can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such <b>fiber</b> supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode <b>fiber</b> approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the <b>fiber</b> core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
