The connections between interlocking panels are vitally crucial since they affect both performance and homogenous of structure. The depletion of natural aggregate sources and increase amount of waste concrete from construction promote the application of crushed concrete waste aggregate (CCwA) in structure. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the bending strength capacity and mode of failure in reinforced concrete <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> panels by using crushed concrete waste aggregate (CCwA). Two (2) set of interlocking panels with dimension of 75 mm x 900 mm x 500 mm (thickness, length and height) were subjected to three point load at the connection located in the midspan of panels. In comparison, the results shows that the <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> panels with CCwA are passing the entire requirement in specified MS and BS. This is showing that interlocking panels with CCwA can be an alternative in replacing the natural aggregates. The study shows that the interlocking panels using CCwA under three loading points are good enough to be used in industry. This will promote application of interlocking panel in construction and give out a solution on the wastage of construction material and shortage in natural aggregate...|$|E
40|$|SummaryScarf {{osteotomy}} of {{the first}} metatarsal bone to correct hallux valgus deformity has benefited {{from a number of}} improvements over the past two decades, most notably regarding the internal fixation method. Internal fixation was deemed mandatory by the authors of early case-series studies. Maestro suggested eliminating the proximal screw by locking the two fragments distally: a notch was created via a medial extension of the cephalic part of the osteotomy, the plantar fragment was displaced laterally, and the distal end of the proximal fragment was then fit into the notch (secondary cut and <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> technique). To further develop this concept and to increase the potential range of translation, we developed an original technique involving distal locking without shortening and proximal stabilisation by impaction of a cortical-cancellous bone graft taken from the medial overhanging edge of the proximal fragment.

Instead, eight shallow-penetration holes were drilled into basement on the East Pacific Rise, and five on the Galapagos Rift. The deepest penetration was 52. 2 meters in Hole 428 A. Most holes were abandoned {{at an early}} stage because of extreme torquing on the drill string and caving of rocks into the holes. The drilling difficulties were much more severe than experienced with crust of similar age in the North Atlantic. They were caused by a combination of factors, of which the most important are: 1) The basalts are highly fractured, possibly a result of dropping of fault blocks from the East Pacific Rise axial plateau; 2) the lavas consist of a large proportion of sheet flows rather than pillows, and therefore do not have the <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> struc...|$|E
40|$|Joints permit {{efficient}} locomotion, {{especially among}} animals with a rigid skeleton. Joint morphologies vary {{in the body}} of individual animals, and the shapes of homologous joints often differ across species. The diverse locomotive behaviors of animals are based, in part, on the developmental and evolutionary history of joint morphogenesis. We showed previously that strictly coordinated cell-differentiation and cell-movement events within the epidermis sculpt the interlocking ball-and-socket joints in the adult Drosophila tarsus (distal leg). Here, we show that the tarsal joints of various insect species can be classified into three types: ball-and-socket, side-by-side and uniform. The last two probably result from joint formation without the cell-differentiation step, the cell-movement step, or both. Similar morphological variations were observed in Drosophila legs when Notch function was temporarily blocked during joint formation, implying that the independent acquisition of cell differentiation and cell movement underlay the elaboration of tarsal joint morphologies during insect evolution. These results provide a framework for understanding how the seemingly complex morphology of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> could have developed during evolution by the addition of simple developmental modules: cell differentiation and cell movement...|$|E

Providing lateral joints at appropriate spacing {{is one of the}} solutions to overcome the said stresses. Width of a joint will be wider at the time when curling and contraction strains are at the optimum strain. It is essential to consider daily temperature variation, shrinkage and curling together with the fatigue damage in determination of optimum joint spacing for concrete roads. Rigid pavements are usually exposed to solar radiation to a great extent and as a result thermal stresses are developed. This research propose a methodology to estimate the relevant deformation (width of the joint) of concrete due to its exposure to the solar radiation incorporate the temperature variation of the concrete slab by use of a 3 D finite element model (FEM) approach. A laboratory scale slab was used to verify the results obtained from the FEM. Lateral deformations due to shrinkage effect were calculated according to the American Concrete Institute shrinkage model (ACI 209 R- 92). Aggregate interlocking is an efficient load transfer mechanism for thin concrete pavements which are commonly used in rural roads.

Since the {{automotive industry}}, {{as well as}} many others, is in need of improvements in this area, this project is focused on developing a new process that joins dissimilar materials with maximum strength conceivable by in part minimizing any brittle intermetallic region that may be formed. If successful, this research would produce a strong, lightweight, and efficient joint. Potentially, the Friction Stir Forming process can meet these criteria and overcome all of the current challenges that other processes are facing in a cheaper way without additional mass from rivets, bolts, or other fasteners. Fillers, chips, and substantial energy for heating can also be avoided. The concept of this process is to heat the top sheet by friction generated by a rotating tool, which simultaneously applies a downward force causing the top sheet to deform into a prefabricated hole in the bottom sheet. A mechanical <b>interlocking</b> <b>joint</b> can be formed with relatively simple machinery and techniques.

In view of this concern, the recently introduced Eurocode 3 : Part 5 has introduced strength reduction factors to account for the effect of RMA during design.

Due to a small size of constituting nanostructural units and a consequently high volume ratio of such interfacial regions, this question becomes crucial for the overall mechanical performance. Boron nitride bamboo-like nanotubes, called hereafter boron nitride nanobamboos (BNNBs), are composed of short BN nanotubular segments with specific interfaces at the bamboo-shaped joints. In this work, the mechanical properties of such structures are investigated by using direct in situ transmission electron microscopy tensile tests and molecular dynamics simulations. The mechanical properties and deformation behaviors are correlated with the interfacial structure under atomic resolution, and a geometry strengthening effect is clearly demonstrated. Due to the <b>interlocked</b> <b>joint</b> interfacial structures and compressive interfacial stresses, the deformation mechanism is switched from an interplanar sliding mode to an in-plane tensile elongation mode.

Nevertheless, the surveys have shown, the prefabricated load bearing wall and modular structure is difficult to modify. The reason is about the inflexibility of the structure. Therefore, it is needed to think about the new possibilities of the prefabrication structure for the future modification of detached house. In contrast, conventional structural system such as 1. <b>Interlocking</b> and <b>joint</b> 2. Masonry and concrete casting, provides more flexibilities in expansion and modification. However, these conventional structural systems require expert to control expansion quality. Purpose / Context – This paper conducted to find better solutions of expansion and modification process of detached houses in Bangkok, alongside with the improvement of existing structures.

40|$|Abstract: Resource {{dependence}} theory (RDT) {{has long}} been a premier framework for understanding organization-environmental relations, but an empirical synthesis of its predictions is still lacking. Using meta-analysis, we consolidate 147 tests of RDT and corroborate its main predictions: organizations respond to resource dependencies by forming interorganizational arrangements like <b>interlocks,</b> alliances, <b>joint</b> ventures, in-sourcing arrangements, and mergers and acquisitions. In turn, these arrangements make them more autonomous and more legitimate. We also extend RDT in three ways. First, we ‘unpack’ the theory by showing that the mechanisms linking arrangement formation to organizational autonomy and legitimacy differ across arrangements. Second, we address the question whether RDT is also a theory of organizational performance. We find that whereas autonomy positively mediates the relationship between arrangement formation and performance, legitimacy does not. This suggests that RDT can also explain organizational actions which have societal acceptance rather than economic performance as an ulterior motive. Third, we assess whether competition law is a boundary condition to RDT’s prescriptions. Specifically, we show that the adoption of the horizontal merger guidelines in the U. S. has caused organizations to ‘flee’ from mergers to less regulated arrangements like alliances and joint ventures, and has hurt the profitability of the remaining mergers...|$|R

Since the 1980 s, studies on interfirm networks have become the order of the day in Western academia, with topics encompassing <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks, <b>joint</b> venture or cooperation networks, industry constellations, strategic alliances, business groups, subcontracting and outsourcing agreement networks, membership of chamber of commerce networks, and so on (Oliver 1990; Galsberg and Schwartz 1983). A consistent discovery is that interfirm networks could reduce transaction cost, transmit signals of legitimacy to the outside world, and improve corporate performance (Keister 1998; Podolny 2001; Bian and Qiu 2000; Li and Dong 2003).|$|R
