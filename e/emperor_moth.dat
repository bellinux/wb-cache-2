[...] Behind the moth is a background of Lords-and-Ladies. The size of the moth and plants in the background pull the spectator into the work.

6000|$|Now if {{we turn to}} the {{enormous}} group of moths, which do not habitually expose to full view the under surface of their wings, this side is very rarely, as I hear from Mr. Stainton, coloured more brightly than the upper side, or even with equal brightness. Some exceptions to the rule, either real or apparent, must be noticed, as that of Hypopyra, specified by Mr. Wormald.[513] Mr. R. Trimen informs me that in Guenée’s great work, three moths are figured, in which the under surface is much the most brilliant. For instance, in the Australian Gastrophora the upper surface of the fore-wing is pale greyish-ochreous, while the lower surface is magnificently ornamented by an ocellus of cobalt-blue, placed {{in the midst of a}} black mark, surrounded by orange-yellow, and this by bluish-white. But the habits of these three moths are unknown; so that no explanation can be given of their unusual style of colouring. Mr. Trimen also informs me that the lower surface of the wings in certain other Geometræ[514] and quadrifid Noctuæ are either more variegated or more brightly-coloured than the upper surface; but some of these species have the habit of “holding their wings quite erect over their backs, retaining them in this position for a considerable time,” and thus exposing to view the under surface. Other species when settled on the ground or herbage have the habit of now and then suddenly and slightly lifting up their wings. Hence the lower surface of the wings being more brightly-coloured than the upper surface in certain moths is not so anomalous a circumstance as it at first appears. The Saturniidæ include some of the most beautiful of all moths, their wings being decorated, as in our British <b>Emperor</b> <b>moth,</b> with fine ocelli; and Mr. T. W. Wood[515] observes that they resemble butterflies in some of their movements; “for instance, in the gentle waving up and down of the wings, as if for display, which is more characteristic of diurnal than of nocturnal Lepidoptera.” ...|$|E

Some exceptions to the rule, either real or apparent, must be noticed, as the case of Hypopyra. (16. See Mr. Wormald on this moth: 'Proceedings of the Entomological Society,' March 2, 1868.) Mr. Trimen informs me that in Guenee's great work, three moths are figured, in which the under surface is much the more brilliant.

60|$|Formation and {{variability}} of the Ocelli or eye-like Spots on the Plumage of Birds.—As no ornaments are {{more beautiful than}} the ocelli on the feathers of various birds, on the hairy coats of some mammals, on the scales of reptiles and fishes, on the skin of amphibians, {{on the wings of}} many Lepidoptera and other insects, they deserve to be especially noticed. An ocellus consists of a spot within a ring of another colour, like the pupil within the iris, but the central spot is often surrounded by additional concentric zones. The ocelli on the tail-coverts of the peacock offer a familiar example, as well as those on the wings of the peacock-butterfly (Vanessa). Mr. Trimen has given me a description of a S. African moth (Gynanisa Isis), allied to our <b>Emperor</b> <b>moth,</b> in which a magnificent ocellus occupies nearly the whole surface of each hinder wing; it consists of a black centre, including a semi-transparent crescent-shaped mark, surrounded by successive ochre-yellow, black, ochre-yellow, pink, white, pink, brown, and whitish zones. Although we do not know the steps by which these wonderfully beautiful and complex ornaments have been developed, the process at least with insects has probably been a simple one; for, as Mr. Trimen writes to me, “no characters of mere marking or coloration are so unstable in the Lepidoptera as the ocelli, both in number and size.” Mr. Wallace, who first called my attention to this subject, shewed me a series of specimens of our common meadow-brown butterfly (Hipparchia Janira) exhibiting numerous gradations from a simple minute black spot to an elegantly-shaded ocellus. In a S. African butterfly (Cyllo Leda) belonging to the same family, the ocelli are even still more variable. In some specimens (A, fig. 52) large spaces on the upper surface of the wings are coloured black, and include irregular white marks; and from this state a complete gradation can be traced into a tolerably perfect (A¹) ocellus, and this results from the contraction of the irregular blotches of colour. In another series of specimens a gradation can be followed from excessively minute white dots, surrounded by a scarcely visible black line (B), into perfectly symmetrical and large ocelli (B¹).[192] In cases like these, the development of a perfect ocellus does not require a long course of variation and selection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the marketability and nutritional qualities of four edible insect species in Benue State. Using market survey checklists, 10 out of the 23 Local Government Areas and three major towns of Benue State were covered for data collection. Proximate composition of the edible insects marketed {{in the study area}} was determined on dry weight basis. One-way ANOVA was used in analyzing the data collected. Results showed that Cirina forda Westwood had significantly the highest mean quantity per marketer of 13. 2 kg. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean quantity per marketer of Bunaea alcinoe Cram (3. 5 kg), Macrotermes natalensis Haviland (1. 6 kg) and Brachytrupes membranaceus Drury (0. 2 kg).

The 'I, Cave Ceremony' {{marked the}} opening of Georgina Starr's solo exhibition 'I,Cave' at mima (Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art) on 9 th April 2015. The performance, which began as a procession through the mima gallery atrium, activated key elements of Starr's installation with performed poetry, sound and scripted action. The poems were spoken, shouted and sung by the performers inside and around 'The Tunnel' (2015), a large sculpture which served as mouth piece, stage, entrance, exit and speaker chamber. The performers enacted specific choreographed movement relating to the sculptures, costumes, photographs and drawings in the exhibition. Starr conducted the action from behind a typewriter where the sounds and colours of the words being typed dictated the tempo of the ceremony. Two 12 " vinyl records, Alberto Ginastera's 1967 opera 'Bomarzo'* and Starr's own record 'Mum Sings Hello'** played central roles in the performance alongside a cast of 5 female performers, 10 year old twin girls and a case of emerging <b>Emperor</b> <b>Moths.</b> Starr has described the piece as being partly inspired by a vision she had while visiting Bomarzo, the Parco dei Mostri (Park of Monsters), a 16 th century sculpture park in Italy created by Pier Francesco Orsini.

50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the southern and brown hawkers, emperor, hairy dragonfly and black-tailed skimmer. The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially the moths, with over 1000 species. The nationally rare reed leopard moth is common at the site. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and <b>emperor.</b> China-mark <b>moths</b> such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green hairstreak, brown argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail.|$|R
50|$|Caterpillars {{can usually}} be found on young adult leaves between October and March (the Australian Spring and Summer). When the {{caterpillars}} hatch they are black with short hairs on top of small nodes on their bodies called tubercles. The hairs are not poisonous and will not sting. As the caterpillars mature they change color each time they shed their skin (which totals to five stages in the caterpillar's appearance). The fully grown caterpillars are usually found on the highest branches of the host tree where the leaves are the youngest and easiest to digest. By the final stage before pupation the caterpillars have developed striking coloration, having a yellow/cream stripe down their bright green/blue body and nodes of red and blue. Despite this they are still surprisingly hard to spot. The caterpillar stage in the <b>emperor</b> gum <b>moth's</b> life cycle can last for many weeks, depending on the temperature and weather conditions.|$|R
