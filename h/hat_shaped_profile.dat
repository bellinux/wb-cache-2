40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes an Linear Matrix Inequality based problem {{formulation}} {{to determine}} input <b>shaped</b> <b>profiles.</b> The cost function is the residual energy, a quadratic {{function of the}} amplitude of the <b>shaped</b> <b>profile,</b> for each sampling interval. The Schur complement permits representing the quadratic function as a Linear Matrix Inequality. Augmenting the state space model with {{the sensitivity of the}} states to uncertain parameters, input <b>shaped</b> <b>profiles</b> which are robust to model uncertainties can be derived. Finally, a minimax input <b>shaped</b> <b>profile</b> which minimizes the maximum magnitude of the resid-ual energy over the domain of uncertainties is determined using the LMI problem. The proposed technique is illustrated on the single spring-mass-dashpot example. The solutions derived are shown to coincide with the solutions presented in the literature, without the requirement of solving a nonlinear programming problem. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{development}} of a novel cross correlation technique for shape matching between two similar objects.

The cross correlation technique is applied to the <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> of the two image objects to evaluate their similarity. An application of the <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> technique is presented in the context of pose detection of human models from image sequences or videos. To extract the feature points on the human model, a number of human motion templates are constructed with designated feature points on each of the human motion profiles. The human model feature extraction procedure is divided into two steps, including: (1) pre-process and construction of motion templates, and (2) extraction of feature points.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Lee and Neuhoff found an {{asymptotic}} formula for {{the distribution of}} the length of the errors produced by a vector quantizer with many quantization points.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} soft contact lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design on the apparent epithelial thickness and indentation of the ocular surface with lens movement. Methods. Four soft contact lens designs comprising of two different plano midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profiles</b> and two edge designs (chiseled and knife edge) of silicone-hydrogel material were examined in 26 subjects aged 24. 7 ± 4. 6 years, each worn bilaterally in randomized order. Lens movement was imaged enface on insertion, at 2 and 4 hours with a high-speed, high-resolution camera simultaneous to the cross-section of {{the edge of the}} contact lens interaction with the ocular surface captured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) nasally, temporally, and inferiorly. Optical imaging distortions were individually corrected for by imaging the apparent distortion of a glass slide surface by the removed lens. Results. Apparent epithelial thickness varied with edge position (P < 0. 001). When distortion was corrected for, epithelial indentation decreased with time after insertion (P = 0. 010), changed after a blink (P < 0. 001), and varied with position on the lens edge (P < 0. 001), with the latter being affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge design. Horizontal and vertical lens movement did not change with time postinsertion. Vertical motion was affected by midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> (P < 0. 001) and edge design (P < 0. 001). Lens movement was associated with physiologic epithelium thickness for lens midperipheral <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> and edge designs. Conclusions. Dynamic OCT coupled with high-resolution video demonstrated that soft contact lens movement and image-corrected ocular surface indentation were influenced by both lens edge design and midperipheral lens <b>shape</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{observed}} the <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> of river ice underside using acoustic rotary sonar. Firstly, we drilled small holes {{on the river}} ice, and put the rotary sonar into the water. Next, we measured the length of 16 directions from the rotary sonar to river ice. Then, we calculated 0. 06 × 0. 06 (m) -mesh data from the observed data and transferred to the <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> of river ice underside. We carried out another observation that is the time series vertical distribution of velocity using ADCP fixed at the river bed, and calculated roughness factor of river ice. Ice thickness estimated by roughness factor tended to decrease with time, it corresponded with the ice thickness observed by rotary sonar. To consider accuracy of our measurement, the observed <b>shape</b> <b>profile</b> of river ice underside compare with the calculated profile by ice thickness formula considering heat balance. The result shows good agreement with each other.
