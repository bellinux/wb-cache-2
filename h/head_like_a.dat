5|$|Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monk in protest. Mẫu {{had decided}} to leave the country for a {{religious}} pilgrimage to India and the diplomatic and press corps assembled at the airport to see him off. He never arrived, as the Ngô family had him arrested. General Đính softened the punishment at the behest of a fellow officer, and put the former diplomat under house arrest instead of placing him in jail.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now to be seen in London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E

Deceased infants, newborns, or aborted babies were buried in crocks or jars, even Chinese porcelain.|$|E

500|$|Ambitious and active-minded, Saint-Just worked {{urgently}} and tirelessly {{towards his}} goals: [...] "For Revolutionists {{there is no}} rest but in the tomb." [...] He was repeatedly described by contemporaries as arrogant, believing {{himself to be a}} skilled leader and orator as well as having proper revolutionary character. This self-assurance manifested itself in a superiority complex, and he always “made it clear… that he considered himself to be in charge and that his will was law.” Camille Desmoulins once wrote of Saint-Just, [...] "He carries his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sacred host." ...|$|E
500|$|Mangalorean Catholic men {{traditionally}} wore long, loose-frilled, {{white or}} black coats known as Kutanv (similar to the Maratha loose coats with buttons), over a Zibbo (loose shirt), while the Pudvem (dhoti), a piece of unstitched cloth, usually around [...] long, was wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. The turban called Mundaas or Urmal, were usually flattened like the Coorgi turbans. It was a long white piece of cloth with a Todop (golden hem) tied around the <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> turban in a particular manner by which they could be easily identified as Catholics. In modern times however, this mode has changed. Only a few older people can be seen wearing this traditional dress on church-going occasions.|$|E
500|$|In August 1963, Nhu, who {{controlled}} {{the special forces}} and secret police, allowed Đính to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the Xá Lợi pagoda, Saigon's largest. The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division, based {{in the town of}} Biên Hòa on Saigon's northern outskirts, into the capital. Although the execution of the raids—which left hundreds dead—was primarily the responsibility of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the special forces head, Đính privately took responsibility, stating to a journalist, [...] "I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [...] He came here to stage a coup d'etat, but I, Tôn Thất Đính, have conquered him and saved the country." [...] In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest, shaved his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him. At the urging of another general, Đính put Mẫu under house arrest instead.|$|E

500|$|The Mellotron has {{a similar}} {{behaviour}} to a sampler, but generates its sound via audio tape. When a key is pressed, a tape connected to it is pushed against a playback <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tape recorder. While the key remains depressed, the tape is drawn over the head, and a sound is played. When the key is released, a spring pulls the tape back to its original position. A variety of sounds {{are available on the}} instrument. On earlier models, the instrument is split into [...] "lead" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] sections. There is a choice of six [...] "stations" [...] of rhythm sounds, each containing three rhythm tracks and three fill tracks. The fill tracks can also be mixed together. Similarly, there is a choice of six lead stations, each containing three lead instruments which can be mixed. In the centre of the Mellotron, there is a tuning button that allows a variation in both pitch and tempo. Later models do not have the concept of stations and have a single knob to select a sound, along with the tuning control. However, the frame containing the tapes is designed to be removed, and replaced with one with different sounds.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor has {{prepared}} the house specially {{for the children}} and the holiday; though the children are pleased, Madge privately explains about Reg's death to the Doctor and insists he not overindulge the children. During the first night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits from the planet Androzani Major (Bill Bailey, Paul Bazely, and Arabella Weir). She holds them at gunpoint and is taken back to their excavation walker and told that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is [...] "weak", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, the crown acting as an interface.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "opossum" [...] is {{borrowed}} from the Powhatan language and was first recorded between 1607 and 1611 by John Smith (as opassom) and William Strachey (as aposoum). Both men encountered the language at the British settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, which Smith helped to found and where Strachey later served as its first secretary. Strachey's notes describe the opossum as a [...] "beast in bigness of a pig and in taste alike," [...] while Smith recorded it [...] "hath an <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swine ... tail like a rat ... of the bigness of a cat." [...] The Powhatan word ultimately derives from a Proto-Algonquian word (*wa·p-aʔθemwa) meaning [...] "white dog or dog-like beast." ...|$|E
2500|$|The unicorn, tamable only by {{a virgin}} woman, was well {{established}} in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as [...] "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn {{in the middle of}} the forehead... They have a <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." [...] It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros. In German, since the 16th century, Einhorn ("one-horn") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, {{inflamed}} {{the situation}} by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, [...] "If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I {{will be glad to}} supply the gasoline." [...] The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and the closure of the university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his <b>head</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.|$|E
