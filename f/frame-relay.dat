40|$|Abstract: For de novo pattern mining in genomic sequences, {{the main}} issues are {{constructing}} pattern definition model (PDM) and mining sequence patterns (MSP). The representations of PDMs {{and the discovery}} of patterns are functionally dependent; the performances thus depend on the adopted PDMs. The popular PDMs provide only descriptive patterns; they lack multifaceted considerations. Many of existing MSP methods are tied up with the exclusively devised PDMs, and the specialized and sophisticated models make the mined results hard to be reused. In this research, an integrative pattern mining system is proposed, which consists of a computationoriented PDM (CO-PDM) and general-purpose MSP (GP-MSP) methods. The CO-PDM defines four computational concerns (CCs) as facets of MSP: expression (E), location (L), range (R) and weight (W), which are integrated into a <b>frame-relayed</b> pattern model (FRPM). The GP-MSP develops a <b>frame-relayed</b> search strategy to resolve the ELR-CCs firstly, with the aids of criticalparameter automating (CPA) procedure; and then the W-CC is determined by hybridizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed FRPM and GP-MSP had been implemented and applied to 22, 448 human introns; from the results, all the well-known patterns were recovered and some new ones were also discovered. Furthermore, th...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{are being used}} increasingly in industrial, health care, military and public-safety environments. In these environments security is extremely important because a successful attack against the network may {{pose a threat to}} human life. To secure such wireless networks against hostile attack requires both preventative and detective measures. In this paper we propose a novel intrusion detection mechanism that identifies man-in-the-middle and wormhole attacks against wireless mesh networks by external adversaries. A simple modification to the wireless MAC protocol is proposed to expose the presence of an adversary conducting a <b>frame-relaying</b> attack. We evaluate the modified MAC protocol experimentally and show the detection mechanism to have a high detection rate, no false positives and a small computational and communication overhead.

50|$|Southwest Network Services (SNS) was a {{nationwide}} data communications carrier {{which began in}} late 1991. The SNS network was a circuit-switched network consisting of DSC Communications CP4000 and CS1 DCSs (digital cross-connect systems) in many major U.S. cities, as well as smaller cities in Texas. During the early nineties SNS carried subrate (< DS0) modem and DDS traffic, and eventually scaled to DS0, fractional T-1 and T1 products. In 1994, SNS deployed a small <b>frame-relay</b> network consisting of Cascade Communications STDX-3000s, 6000s, and 9000s. The entire carrier network was sold by Netsolve to ICI Communications of Orlando, Florida in early 1996. ICI was later bought by MCI Communications.|$|E

This was because it used InSoft's Digital Video Everywhere (Open DVE), a proprietary alogorithm that featured an API for running multimedia conferencing software across many kinds of networks, not independent of the hardware they used. Running as an independent software layer on top of the specific host operating system, DVE architecture let users and vendors customize their InSoft-equipped networks by building applications that worked through Communique. Communique also used InSynch, InSoft's audio/video synchronization algorithm that optimized conference quality when users scaled bandwidth up or down.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Cable-based IP {{telephony}} {{holds the}} promise of simplified and consolidated communication services provided by a single carrier at a lower total cost than consumers currently pay to separate Internet, television, and telephony service providers. Cable operators have already worked through the technical challenges of providing Internet service and are optimizing the existing bandwidth in their cable plants to deliver high-speed Internet access. Now, cable operators have turned their efforts to the delivery of integrated Internet and voice service using that same cable spectrum. Cable-based IP telephony falls under the broad umbrella of voice over IP (VoIP), meaning {{that many of the}} challenges facing cable operators are the same challenges that telecom carriers face as they work to deliver voice over ATM (VoATM) and <b>frame-relay</b> networks. However, ATM and <b>frame-relay</b> services are targeted primarily at the enterprise, a decision driven by economics and the need for service pro...|$|E

The network team {{had been assigned to}} conduct a risk assessment of our companyâ€™s internal network security. We started prioritizing the risks by classifying them as at high, medium and low. The team then recommended a few solutions to address these risks. After publishing the risk assessment report, the team identified a few areas to be fixed as soon as possible. First, the Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) were not fully secured. Second, there was no separation of network services by function. Third, we audited the office environment and found Rogue Wireless Access Points connecting to the office network.

40|$|This study {{comprehensively}} surveys various bandwidth enforcement {{techniques and}} evaluates them from eight commercial/open-source implementations. Bandwidth enforcement at organizational edges can allocate the access-link bandwidth according to administrative policy rules. Their policy rules {{can be categorized}} into (1) class-based bandwidth allocation rule; (2) connection guarantee rule within a class; (3) bandwidth borrowing rule among classes. Researchers have extensively investigates the algorithms from a theoretical/simulationâ€™s point of view. This work further surveys and evaluates the algorithms used in commercial implementations, such as TCP window-sizing, ACK-pacing, and MSSshrinking. The testbed emulates the real-life Internet with heterogeneous Internet impairments (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) to evaluate their effectiveness of policy enforcement, in terms of accuracy, fairness, stability, robustness, bandwidth borrowing, and voice over IP (VoIP) quality. All test results are verified by the vendors and are reproducible through our open tools. Numerical results shows that (1) most implementations fail to effectively allocate the bandwidth for simply 20 TCP connections for a narrowband <b>frame-relay</b> 125 k link; (2) sizing the TCP window can degrade performance and fairness even under slight packet loss rates (0. 5 %); (3) the G. 729 VoIP quality over 125 kbps access link becomes good only when background trafficâ€™s packet size are shrunk below 256 bytes...|$|E
40|$|Most modern {{communication}} systems that support real-time communication (ATM, ISDN, <b>Frame-Relay,</b> etc.) {{are based on}} connection oriented technologies. This is also true for cellular and Personal Communication Systems, where the users are mobile. Consequently, selecting good routes for Virtual Channels (VCs) is considered {{as one of the}} most important problems in modern networks. Usually, the VC route is determined during the session initialization along the shortest path (with respect to some metric) between the users and remains the same during the entire session. However, the user mobility and the fact that the cost of a session may also depend on its duration, motivate the development of dynamic session management algorithms. Such algorithms may reroute the VCs dynamically during the sessions for improving session cost and for supporting hando operations of mobile users. This work deals with the general Session Management problem and proposes several on-line algorithms for managing session between static or mobile users. In the case of static users, we present a 4 -competitive algorithm for the situation where the path cost functions are concave. In the presence of mobile users we prove that for a general graph, mobile users and arbitrary link cost functions with positive setup cost, the competitive ratio of the best on-line algorithm is at least ast n), where n is the number of nodes in the network. We also present constant competitive on-line algorithms for several practical topologies and movement assumptions.
