40|$|Particle {{control is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in tokamak plasma performance. The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external exhaust with pumped limiters and pumped divertors. Wall pumping is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external exhaust techniques with pumped divertors and limiters are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external exhaust on wall pumping. Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the core-wall particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high probability of ionization in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external <b>exhaust</b> <b>mechanism.</b> While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} chemical {{vapour deposition}} is an industrially significant process for forming functional thin films. There {{is a great opportunity}} for increased scientific understanding with the aim of improving current processes and helping to formulate new ones. This work is concerned with developing a methodology to assist this ongoing concern. A combination of spectroscopic and chemometric techniques are used to investigate several {{chemical vapour deposition}} processes. The first investigation concerns the spatial concentration mapping of key by-products during the thermal chemical vapour deposition of tin oxide films through the use of near infra red laser diode spectroscopy. This novel two dimensional characterisation of the process has identified reaction hotspots within the process, and has identified the redundancy of part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Subsequently, there has been improvements to the head design, and the operation of the process. The main thrust of the investigations are focussed towards the use of chemometric methods, such as experimental design and principal components analysis, in conjunction with a suite of spectroscopic measurement techniques, to analyse the plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition of silica films. This work has shown the importance of active oxygen species on the chemistry. It has also been shown that the film properties are highly dependant on oxygen concentration in the reactor, and hence active oxygen species forming in the plasma. The identification of by-products in the silica deposition process has also been carried out for the first time. Finally, this work also presents the first rigorous studies of a new precursor for silica deposition, dichlorodimethylsilane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur global {{understanding}} of the power exhaust in tokamaks, {{and its implications for}} both steady-state and transient heat loads on divertor and limiter PFCs, is still poor. In transient situations in particular, such as during start-up or control operations, the evolution of particles and heat fluxes is little known, although being critical {{for the safety of the}} machine. The heat load is largely determined by the physics of the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), and therefore it depends on a large extent on the geometry of the magnetic surfaces as well as on the geometry of wall components. A better characterization of the heat <b>exhaust</b> <b>mechanisms</b> requires therefore to improve the capabilities of the transport codes in terms of geometrical description of the wall components and in terms of the description of the magnetic geometry. For transient simulations, it also becomes crucial to be able to deal with non-stationary magnetic configurations. In particular, avoiding expensive re-meshing of the computational domain is mandatory. As an attempt to achieve this goals we propose a new fluid solver based on a high-order hybrid discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method. Capitalizing on the experience acquired in the development of the SOLEDGE 2 D-EIRENE transport model, we propose to study the edge plasma transport in the frame of a reduced model (but containing most of the challenging issues regarding accurate numerical simulations) based on electron density and parallel momentum. The code is verified using manufactured solutions and validated using well-referenced simulations in a realistic WEST geometry. Finally, we show how the particle fluxes at the wall vary in our model when evolving the magnetic equilibrium in time, particularly during the equilibrium construction skipping from a limiter configuration to a diverted one at the beginning of the operation...|$|R

Monoaminergic modulation of the HPA system may be one possible pathomechanism by which PCLO exerts its effect on depression. In the present study, we investigated the effect of rs 2522833 on the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in healthy young adults. A total of 66 healthy volunteers from the community (36 men and 30 women) aged 18 – 25 years without individual or family history of affective disorders and schizophrenia collected saliva cortisol samples at 0, 30, 45 and 60 [*]min after awakening on two consecutive working days.

40|$|Abstract—In many parkinsonian syndromes, {{neuromelanin}} (NM) -containing dopaminergic neurons of the {{substantia nigra}} (SN) are selectively {{targeted by the}} noxius pathogens. Studies of the constitutional and functional features of human NM allow the formulation of a logical hypothesis on its role in parkinsonian syndromes. In the early stages, NM synthesis and iron-chelating properties may act as a powerful protective mechanism, delaying symptom appearance and/or slowing disease progression. Once these systems have been <b>exhausted,</b> the pathogenic <b>mechanisms</b> affecting cytoplasmic or-ganelles other than NM destroy NM-harboring neurons, with consequent pouring out of NM granules. These in turn activate microglia, causing release of nitric oxide, interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-, thus becoming an important determinant of disease aggravation.

Next, six 12 ft-high towers known as [...] "rainbirds" [...] began to spray water over the MLP and into the flame deflector trenches below it. The water absorbed some of the bruising forces of the acoustic waves, and discouraged fires that might be caused by the rocket <b>exhaust.</b> This water-dumping <b>mechanism,</b> known as the Sound Suppression System, emptied the launch pad tank in around 41 seconds.

40|$|AbstractMammalian females enter puberty with {{follicular}} reserves {{that exceed}} the number needed for ovulation during a single lifetime. Follicular depletion occurs throughout reproductive life and ends in menopause, or reproductive senescence, when the follicle pool is <b>exhausted.</b> The <b>mechanisms</b> regulating {{the production of}} a species-specific initial follicle pool are not well understood. However, the establishment of a follicular reserve is critical to defining the length of reproductive cyclicity. Here we show that activin A (rh-ActA), a known regulator of follicle formation and growth in vitro, increased the number of postnatal mouse primordial follicles by 30 % when administered to neonatal animals during the time of germline cyst breakdown and follicle assembly. This expansion in the initial follicle pool was characterized by a significant increase in both germ cell and granulosa cell proliferation. However, the excess follicles formed shortly after birth did not persist into puberty and both adult rh-ActA- and vehicle-treated animals demonstrated normal fertility. A follicle atresia kinetic constant (kA) was modeled for the two groups of animals, and consistent with the empirical data, the kA for rh-ActA-treated was twice that of vehicle-treated animals. Kinetic constants for follicle formation, follicle loss and follicle expansion from birth to postnatal day 19 were also derived for vehicle and rh-ActA treatment conditions. Importantly, introduction of exogenous rh-ActA revealed an intrinsic ovarian quorum sensing mechanism that controls the number of follicles available at puberty. We propose that there is an optimal number of oocytes present at puberty, and when the follicle number is exceeded, it occurs at the expense of oocyte quality. The proposed mechanism provides a means by which the ovary eliminates excess follicles containing oocytes of poor quality prior to puberty, thus maintaining fertility in the face of abnormal hormonal stimuli in the prepubertal period...|$|R
40|$|After a {{dramatic}} economic decline {{after the collapse}} of the Soviet Union and the financial breakdown of 1998, the Russian economy has begun to emerge from its deep crisis. The years 1999 - 2004 were a period of dynamic development in all sectors of Russian economy, and saw a rapid growth in GDP of over 7 per cent per year. Russia owed the excellent macroeconomic results of that period to a combination of favourable factors. The key factors were: high hydrocarbon prices on the global markets; an increase in Russia's international competitiveness thanks to the "rouble devaluation effect" (following the 1998 financial crash); and the market reforms carried out within that period. In 2004, despite very high oil and gas prices on world markets, a slowdown of the GDP growth took place. Even though the economy is still developing fairly rapidly, we are able to say that Russia is <b>exhausting</b> those traditional <b>mechanisms</b> (apart from oil and gas prices) which have hitherto stimulated GDP growth. Moreover, there are no new mechanisms which could replace the old ones. In the longer term, these unsolved structural problems may seriously impede Russia's economic growth...|$|R
40|$|During {{recent years}} {{interest}} in the impact of commercial aircraft on the climate has increased. Aircraft might impact climate {{in a number of}} ways.

The SUCCESS program was carried out to investigate these issues.

40|$|The {{high thrust}} to weight ratios now {{possible}} for military aircraft have made thrust vector pitch control more attractive and versatile than aerodynamic surface pitch control. Use of a rectangular nozzle {{is a natural}} consequence because articulation and sealing problems are less formidable than for conventional circular nozzles.

One direct consequence {{of this is that}} in many places perceived temperature is higher than before. This is due to shifts in both temperature and humidity as the climate system reacts to the higher level of heat and the accompanying processes redistributing warm air and moisture in the atmosphere. Hot weather {{has been shown to be}} potentially dangerous in many contexts to various aspects of human life. From a health perspective, heat creates additional stress for the body, potentially impacting the circulatory and nervous systems. Exhaustion rates increase and the need for hydration rises.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended self-recuperative radiant tube burner fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal recirculation <b>mechanism</b> (<b>exhaust</b> gases recirculation, EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube.

40|$|Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) {{continues}} to be a major problem worldwide. Today, intensive care of patients with TBI is mainly focused on preventing and treating secondary brain injuries. High pressure inside the intracranial cavity {{has been found to be}} an important feature of disturbed cerebral dynamics and secondary injuries. Thus, invasive measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is today a well established routine in modern neuro-intensive care. Variations in ICP can be regarded as a response of the cerebrospinal system to different stimuli, including homeostatic mechanisms which attempt to maintain the cerebral equilibrium. Nevertheless, the autoregulatory processes and their functionality may also be affected by ICP. This study is an attempt to investigate the cerebral hemodynamics through analysis of ICP and other biomedical measurements available, such as arterial blood pressure and electrocardiography. The study is mainly conducted by analysing biomedical data through mathematical modelling, model-based frameworks, and simulations. This thesis focuses on the dynamics of intracranial pressure in either presence or absence of cerebral autoregulation. A model-based framework which describes the relationship between arterial distensibility and compliance was developed to study variations in the mechanical properties of distant cerebral artries/arteriols. The measurements of pulse wave propagation velocity as well as transfer function between arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure were utilized as the key elements of the study. Using the aforementioned model, it was shown that variations in the level of ICP may arise from different states of cerebral autoregulation and the associated regime within the cerebral vasculature. The state of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) autoregulation during plateau waves of ICP was taken as a subsequent focus of the study. The investigation was conducted by applying the mathematical models of cerebral hemodynamics to the measurements from a TBI patient. Considering the mechanical properties of the cerebrovascular system, the study examined models of impaired as well as intact CBF autoregulation as the possible options. Although the intact autoregulatory mechanism could simulate elevated ICP waves, a large time constant of regulation far from the reported response times in human was needed. The assumption of an <b>exhausted</b> autoregulatory <b>mechanism,</b> however, led to the results pointing to a partial collapse within the cerebral arterial-arteriolar path. Finally, the origin of plateau waves of ICP was investigated by reviewing the phenomenon from a new perspective. The estimation of the baroreceptor reflex index was utilised to locate the source of bradycardia during ICP plateau waves. The result suggested that an activation of the Cushing reflex when the cerebral arterial-arteriolar segment suffers from a partial collapse may lead to the generation of these waves. Furthermore, a negative correlation between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and CBF was recognised associated to this circumstance. It is concluded that a CPP-oriented treatment of TBI patients who demonstrate ICP plateau waves may not lead to the expected regulation of CBF...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to understand the fate of naphthalene and n-alkylnaphthalenes during diesel combustion, and an evaluation of their sources in diesel exhaust emissions. This was achieved by the use of a procedure which employed a [14 C]radiolabelled PAH technique and a diesel enriched fuel technique (DEFT). The combustion of diesel fuel spiked with [14 C]naphthalene has shown unequivocally that 0. 5 % of the naphthalene contained in diesel fuel survives combustion under the engine conditions studied (2500 rpm and 50 Nm). The survived naphthalene represented 22. 8 % of the total recovered naphthalene, the other 77. 2 % was presumably pyrosynthetic in nature. The sources of the pyrosynthesised naphthalene in the emissions was investigated at 2500 rpm and 50 Nm. The previously unreported input of n-methylnaphthalenes to the pyrosynthesised naphthalene was demonstrated by combusting fuel spiked with [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene. Radiolabelled 2 - methylnaphthalene (0. 53 % of the original [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene) which had survived combustion, and radiolabelled naphthalene (0. 02 % of the original [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene), were recovered in the exhaust extracts. This showed unequivocally that 2 -methylnaphthalene was converted to naphthalene in the combustion chamber. The first enrichment experiments (DEFT), in which 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene were added separately to fuel prior to combustion confirmed that demethylation of both species produced naphthalene in small yields (1. 9 % and 6. 1 % respectively). The contribution of n-alkylnaphthalenes with the alkyl group greater than methyl in length, to pyrosynthesised naphthalene contained in exhaust emissions was investigated using fuel spiked with non-radiolabelled alkyl-PAH. The major product of combustion of these compounds was 2 - vinylnaphthalene, with a 0. 08 % conversion for 2 -butylnaphthalene and a 0. 01 % conversion for 2 - ethylnaphthalene. No dealkylated products were detected in the <b>exhaust</b> emissions. A <b>mechanism</b> for the formation of 2 -vinylnaphthalene was proposed. The effect of engine speed and load on the recovery of naphthalene and the contribution of pyrosynthesised and survived naphthalene to recovered naphthalene were established using [14 C]naphthalene.

But it was to reverse the doctrine of Barron that Bingham rallied his fellow Republicans of the Thirty-ninth Congress (or Convention Congress, to use an Ackernym). A concern with such major transformations in the constitutional order is one theme that ties the most recent books of this Yale Law School tag-team of Amar and Ackerman together; another is their common conviction that the formal amendment procedures of Article V do not <b>exhaust</b> the actual <b>mechanisms</b> by which such fundamental changes have been (Ackerman) or may be (Amar) effected. Both books illustrate the marked turn toward history - especially the history of politics and institutions - that seems so conspicuous a feature of contemporary legal scholarship as well as of social science. Both books are substantially (though only partly) historical in character; for the essence of the historian 2 ̆ 7 s enterprise is the explanation of change - including transformative change - rather than the archaeological recovery of artifacts and mores, or the simple narration of events. And both books evince a reasonably informed engagement with the requisite historical monographs and syntheses...|$|R
40|$|Members of the South African National Defence Force (the “SANDF”) are {{excluded}} from {{the application of the}} Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995. They were also prohibited by the Defence Act 44 of 1957, which was in force until 30 April 2003, to form or join any trade unions. However, they were regarded as workers as contemplated by section 23 (2) of the Constitution of the RSA, 1996 (the “Constitution”). As such the said prohibition was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. Current defence force legislation allows members of the SANDF to form and join military trade unions. Registered military trade unions have the right to organise. A registered military trade union that has reached the prescribed threshold for admission to the Military Bargaining Council, obtains collective bargaining rights. These so-called collective bargaining rights of military trade unions have posed the question if section 23 (5) of the Constitution does not impose a correlative duty on the SANDF as the employer to bargain collectively with the military trade unions. This was subsequently the subject of five court cases. This dissertation critically considers this research question. The legal position of the International Labour Organisation (the “ILO”) is examined with specific reference to the conventions relating to the freedom of association, the right to organise and collective bargaining. This research shows that the said ILO conventions do not exclude armed forces from its application. However, it is left for countries to determine its applicability. This is confirmed by the different approaches of member states in respect of the recognition of military unions. The research further illustrates that the ILO adopts a voluntary approach towards collective bargaining. This dissertation then examines the relevant defence force legislation providing for the right to freedom of association, the right to organise and collective bargaining. It is emphasised that the constitution of the Military Bargaining Council places a duty on the SANDF to bargain collectively with recognised military trade unions. This dissertation also considers the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, the relevant provisions of the Constitution and opinions of authoritative writers and concludes that there is no enforceable duty on the employer to bargain collectively with the trade unions. This is also confirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeal. However, for technical reasons the Constitutional Court did not confirm or reject the position of the Supreme Court of Appeal in this regard. This would have brought finality on this question. With reference to the position in the military, this dissertation shows that the SANDF cannot unilaterally withdraw from negotiations in the Military Bargaining Council and may not unilaterally impose pre-conditions for participating in the Military Bargaining Council. Furthermore, the SANDF may not unilaterally implement any matters relating to conditions of service as contemplated by Regulation 36 of the General Regulations of the SANDF, before <b>exhausting</b> the dispute <b>mechanisms</b> of the Military Bargaining Council. This is indicative of a duty to bargain on these matters before unilateral implementation. In conclusion this dissertation states that the current developments do not make collective bargaining in the Department of Defence possible.
