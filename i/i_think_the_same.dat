According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period. The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and {{it had nothing to do}} with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing happened to grindcore, if you want to call it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

60|$|Tertullian, I think, says he {{had seen}} the {{autograph}} copies of some of the apostles' writings. The truth is, the ancient Church was not guided by the mere fact of the genuineness of a writing in pronouncing it canonical;-- its catholicity was the test applied to it. I have not the smallest doubt that the Epistle of Barnabas is genuine; but it is not catholic; it is full of the [Greek: gnosis], though of the most simple and pleasing sort. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> of Hermas. The Church would never admit either into the canon, although the Alexandrians always read the Epistle of Barnabas in their churches for three hundred years together. It was upwards of three centuries before the Epistle to the Hebrews was admitted, and this on account of its [Greek: gnosis]; at length, by help of the venerable prefix of St. Paul's name, its admirers, happily for us, succeeded.|$|E

'Besides,' added Tom, 'there is really nothing--nothing to tell. I'm not going to commit myself. I don't know whether I ever shall. I was mad that day, and I want to satisfy my mind whether <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> now I am sane, and if I do, I shall have enough {{to do to make}} her forget the winter when I made myself such an ass.

60|$|But I {{think there}} is a limit, and a highly {{legitimate}} limit, to this process. I think a man may praise Pindar without knowing the top of a Greek letter from the bottom. But I think that if a man is going to abuse Pindar, if he is going to denounce, refute, and utterly expose Pindar, if he is going to show Pindar up as the utter ignoramus and outrageous impostor that he is, then I think it will be just as well perhaps--I think, at any rate, it would do no harm--if he did know a little Greek, and even had read a little Pindar. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> situation would be involved if the critic were concerned to point out that Pindar was scandalously immoral, pestilently cynical, or low and beastly in his views of life. When people brought such attacks against the morality of Pindar, I should regret that they could not read Greek; and when they bring such attacks against the morality of Fielding, I regret very much that they cannot read English.|$|E

You will never make me believe in a protracted flirtation between a gentleman and lady, where at least half the blame does not lie on his lordship's side.

Thus, he can pass through space and take others with him, and return again. He can learn what is happening in far-off parts of the world, as he did when he told you of the war in which your country is concerned. He has terrible powers; for instance, he can kill, as he killed those savages. Also, he knows the secrets of the earth, and, if it pleases him, can change its turning so that earthquakes happen and sea becomes land, and land sea, and the places that were hot grow cold, and those that were cold grow hot." ...|$|E

A man who never said that he was a god, but who, they said, put poison into their wells, which he did not do, but which they believed he did because {{he was one of the}} race that thirteen hundred years ago killed their God?

If it is necessary for them, it is still more necessary for us, and I think that it should be a standing rule that we are all ready to mount at daybreak.

If, as I half suspect, I get enough {{subjects}} out of the islands, TICONDEROGA shall be suppressed, and we'll call the volume SOUTH SEA BALLADS. In health, spirits, renewed interest in life, and, I do believe, refreshed capacity for work, the cruise has proved a wise folly.

60|$|When Herbert {{was gone}} he sat musing over his fire with Aby's letter {{still in his}} hand. A lawyer has always a sort of affection for a scoundrel,--such affection as a hunting man has for a fox. He loves to watch the skill and dodges of the animal, to study the wiles by which he lives, and to {{circumvent}} them by wiles of his own, still more wily. It is his glory to run the beast down; but then he would not for worlds run him down, except in conformity with certain laws, fixed by old custom for the guidance of men in such sports. And the two-legged vermin is adapted for pursuit as is the fox with four legs. He is an unclean animal, leaving a scent upon his trail, which the nose of your acute law hound can pick up over almost any ground. And the more wily the beast is, the longer he can run, the more trouble he can give in the pursuit, the longer he can stand up before a pack of legal hounds, the better does the forensic sportsman love and value him. There are foxes of so excellent a nature, so keen in their dodges, so perfect in their cunning, so skilful in evasion, that a sportsman cannot find it in his heart to push them to their destruction unless the field be very large so that many eyes are looking on. And the feeling is <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with lawyers.|$|E
