40|$|Dendrometers are {{measurement}} devices {{proven to be}} useful to analyze tree water relations and growth responses in relation to environmental variability. To analyze <b>dendrometer</b> data, two analytical methods prevail: (1) daily approaches that calculate or extract single values per day, and (2) stem-cycle approaches that separate high-resolution <b>dendrometer</b> records into distinct phases of contraction, expansion and stem-radius increment. Especially the stem-cycle approach requires complex algorithms to disentangle cyclic phases. Here, we present an R package, named <b>dendrometeR,</b> that facilitates the analysis of <b>dendrometer</b> data using both analytical methods. By making the package freely available, we make a first step towards comparable and reproducible methods to analyze <b>dendrometer</b> data. The package contains customizable functions to prepare, verify, process and plot <b>dendrometer</b> series, as well as functions that facilitate the analysis of <b>dendrometer</b> data (i. e. daily statistics or extracted phases) in relation to environmental data. The functionality of <b>dendrometeR</b> is illustrated in this note...|$|E
40|$|Premise of the study: <b>Dendrometer</b> {{bands are}} a useful {{way to make}} {{sequential}} repeated measurements of tree growth, but traditional <b>dendrometer</b> bands can be expensive, time consuming, and difficult to construct in the field. An alternative to the traditional method of band construction is to adapt commercially available materials. This paper describes how to construct and install <b>dendrometer</b> bands using smooth-edged, stainless steel, cable tie banding and attachable rollerball heads. Methods and Results: As a performance comparison, both traditional and cable tie <b>dendrometer</b> bands were installed on baldcypress trees at the National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana, by both an experienced and a novice worker. Band installation times were recorded, and growth of the trees as estimated by the two band types was measured after approximately one year, demonstrating equivalence of the two methods. Conclusions: This efficient approach to <b>dendrometer</b> band construction can help advance the knowledge of long-term tree growth in ecological studies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe aim of {{this paper}} is to verify the {{accuracy}} of the optical <b>dendrometers</b> Criterion 400 and RC 3 H bystudying the quality of measures of wood volume determination of standing trees through these <b>dendrometers.</b> The study was developed at the Experimental Station of Forest Sciences, in Itatinga, São Paulo state, whichbelongs to the University of São Paulo (ESALQ / USP). It was sampled a total of 175 trees in three plots ofEucalyptus grandis. The stem diameter of standing trees was measured by the two optical <b>dendrometers</b> atdistances of 0. 1, 0. 4, 0. 7, 1. 0, 1. 3, 2. 0 meters from this point meter by meter along the stem up to 8 metersheight. After measuring the standing trees they were felled and the diameter was obtained in differentpositions with a caliper and a tape in the same positions that the non-destructive measures were taken. Withthe diameters the volume was calculated by section and by individual trees by the Smalian formula forthe comparison of methods. Analyzing the measurements of stem diameter and the individual tree volume realizes that the two <b>dendrometers</b> provided measures generally underestimated. However, the Criterionprovided the best estimates. For the diameter and individual tree volume the Criterion showed underestimatederrors averaging approximately 1 cm (10 %), while the RC 3 H resulted in errors greater than 5 cm (30 %) onaverage. Thus, when measuring observed variables in a non-destructive way with reliability and accuracy,the Criterion showed better results...|$|R

40|$|Using <b>dendrometers</b> for {{measuring}} a radial increment of trees is efficient {{not only for}} investigation into {{the dynamics of the}} increment but also for changes in the tree stem in general, for a physiological condition of trees during certain periods of time, reliance on meteorological conditions and for tree-ring formation studies. The conducted research has applied to high resolution DRL 26 <b>dendrometers</b> that helped with identifying and distinguishing the impacts of climatic factors on the physiology and growth of trees. Also, the performed investigation assisted in assessing the impact of microclimate conditions on changes in tree stems. The location for installing <b>dendrometers</b> was selected with reference to the criteria such as representative research location, the degree of violation assessment, equal distribution of research sites in Lithuania and the estimation of climatic, hydrologic and anthropogenic conditions. Considering the above mentioned criteria, three raised bogs in which temperature, automatic water level devices in wells and <b>dendrometers</b> installed in measurement areas were chosen. The research period lasted {{from the end of the}} vegetation period to the beginning of dormancy season. For research purposes, 5 growing Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) were used for examining changes in the stem volume. Another objective was to find out how stems were affected by growing in bog surroundings and to analyse the synchronicity of volume changes between trees. The conducted research disclosed specific features of the dynamics of changes in the stem volume at the end of vegetation, and the beginning of dormancy season was found...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dendrometer</b> {{bands are}} used to make {{repeated}} measurements of tree radial growth. Two types of dendrometers are used worldwide, the industrial and the homemade. Homemade dendrometers prevail in Brazilian forestry studies, but researchers have trouble constructing and installing them. An easier solution is to use industrial <b>dendrometer</b> bands, {{but they are not}} produced in Brazil and, therefore, are expensive and might not be appropriate for local environmental conditions. We analyzed trunk growth measurements each month (from February 2008 to January 2009) using both industrial (imported) and homemade (national components) <b>dendrometer</b> bands installed on 20 trees of Acacia tenuifolia in a seasonally dry forest on limestone outcrops in central Brazil. Cost-benefit comparative analysis of measurements and prices indicates that homemade <b>dendrometer</b> bands have all benefits, and none of the problems, of the imported industrial <b>dendrometer</b> bands, such as the following: (1) similar precision of measurements (correlation analysis: r > 0. 930, P 0. 55), (2) much lower costs (10 to 15 times cheaper), (3) easily manipulated and installated in the field, and (4) absence of some damage to tree trunks that are caused by industrial dendrometers...|$|E

30|$|We {{monitored}} tree stem growth {{patterns for}} pine trees at Avon Park and Buffer Preserve. We used <b>dendrometer</b> bands, which are metal bands placed around tree trunks that expand as the tree grows. As with the punch core data, we collected <b>dendrometer</b> data across varying community types and tree sizes. We installed <b>dendrometer</b> bands on 216 trees (longleaf pine, South Florida slash pine) at Avon Park, and on 60 trees (longleaf pine, slash pine) at Buffer Preserve. Prior to installing the bands, a rasp {{was used to}} remove loose bark. We took measurements of circumference to the nearest 0.1 mm approximately every month for 12 years at Buffer Preserve (Sep 2004 to Jun 2016) and for 2.5 years at Avon Park (Jan 2006 to Jul 2008). Sample sizes decreased slightly over time (three trees died at Buffer Preserve and nine at Avon Park, mostly from lightning strikes). Additionally, relatively intense prescribed fires occasionally destroyed <b>dendrometer</b> band springs, disrupting measurements for particular trees for one or more months until replacement bands were installed. The use and precision of <b>dendrometer</b> bands for monitoring tree stem growth has been reviewed elsewhere (Auchmoody 1976, Clark et al. 2000, Keeland and Young 2014). We did not monitor or account for diel variations in tree circumference (shrink-swell cycles related to water status), but these fluctuations are typically small and are not problematic for most studies of tree growth patterns (Herrmann et al. 2016). Our interest was in understanding what time of year corresponds with the boundary between annual growth rings and, for this purpose, our monthly data and our definition of dormancy was sufficient.|$|E

40|$|The Amazon {{rainforest}} {{plays an}} important role in the global water and carbon cycle, and though it is predicted to continue drying in the future, the effect of drought remains uncertain. Developments in remote sensing missions now facilitate large-scale observations. The RapidScat scatterometer (K u band) mounted on the International Space Station observes the Earth in a non-Sun-synchronous orbit, which allows for studying changes in the diurnal cycle of radar backscatter over the Amazon. Diurnal cycles in backscatter are significantly affected by the state of the canopy, especially during periods of increased water stress. We use RapidScat backscatter time series and water deficit measurements from <b>dendrometers</b> in 20 trees during a 9  month period to relate variations in backscatter to increased tree water deficit. Morning radar bacskcatter dropped significantly with increased tree water deficit measured with <b>dendrometers.</b> This provides unique observational evidence that demonstrates the sensitivity of radar backscatter to vegetation water stress, highlighting the potential of drought detection and monitoring using radar. </p...|$|R
30|$|High {{resolution}} point <b>dendrometers</b> {{were used}} to monitor stem growth at 15  min sampling intervals on three trees per plot, mounted at 1.3  m above ground level. Data were finally averaged to a daily time step. The Mt. Gambier site was instrumented in Oct 2010, and in Oct 2011 instruments were installed at Flynn (HVP). Growth was monitored for two seasons in each case, although started a year apart due to practical issues which delayed the Flynn installation.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} accuracy and limits of the height-accumulation method of measuring tree volume and surface area for Pacific Northwest second-growth trees. Thirty trees were selected from various thinning treatments in a 55 year old Douglas-fir forest. Each tree was measured with the highly accurate Barr and Stroud optical <b>dendrometer</b> and height, surface area, and cubic-foot volume were calculated on a Control Data Corporation 3300 electronic computer. A Spiegel-Relaskop {{was used to measure}} taper steps for height-accumulation. These results were then compared with the <b>dendrometer</b> results to determine the accuracy of this technique. The Relaskop was found to be inadequate when used alone, but when a 4 -power telescope was mounted, it greatly enhanced the usefulness of the instrument. The telescopic Spiegel-Relaskop, using the height-accumulation method, was found to be capable of measuring volume with comparable accuracy to the optical <b>dendrometer.</b> The study revealed that volumes determined using height-accumulation, measured with a telescopic Spiegel-Relaskop, in conjunction with point sampling should estimate volume of a stand as accurately as any other cruising technique. In addition this method, like other recently developed methods, eliminates the use of volume tables and their inherent biases...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantification}} of cambial {{growth over}} short time periods has been hampered by problems to discern between {{growth and the}} swelling and shrinking of a tree stem. This paper presents a model, which separates cambial growth and reversible water-potential induced diurnal changes from simultaneously measured whole stem and xylem radial variations, from field-measured Scots pine trees in Finland. The modelled growth, which includes osmotic concentration changes, was compared with (direct) <b>dendrometer</b> measurements and microcore samples. In addition, the relationship of modelled growth and <b>dendrometer</b> measurements to environmental factors was analysed. The {{results showed that the}} water-potential induced changes of tree radius were successfully separated from stem growth. Daily growth predicted by the model exhibited a high correlation with the modelled daily changes of osmotic concentration in phloem, and a temperature dependency in early summer. Late-summer growth saw higher dependency on water availability and temperature. Evaluation of the model against <b>dendrometer</b> measurements showed that the latter masked a true environmental signal in stem growth due to water-potential induced changes. The model provides better understanding of radial growth physiology and offers potential to examine growth dynamics and changes due to osmotic concentration, and how the environment affects growth...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{progress}} of xylem formation in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was measured during one growing season in southern Finland. Stem radius was monitored continuously with band <b>dendrometers,</b> {{and the formation}} of new tracheids was determined by examination of small increment cores taken twice weekly. Tracheid production started in June and ceased in August. Xylem formation was fastest in early July, when 0. 75 – 1. 25 new tracheids were formed per day. The rate of xylem formation was significantly correlated with mean daily temperature. Synchronous fluctuations in tracheid and lumen diameters were observed at the same relative positions within each annual ring, but no relationship existed between the diameters and weather variables. The timing of changes in stem radius differed from the timing of actual xylem formation. Stem radius increased in April and May, and the fastest daily increments were recorded in June. Increases in stem radius slowed in July, but small increases were measured more than a month after xylem formation had ceased. Daily changes in stem radius were correlated with daily precipitation, reflecting changes in stem water content. Therefore, <b>dendrometers</b> are of dubious value for measuring the timing of actual xylem formation. Small increment cores proved to be useful in assessing actual xylem formation, but the method is laborious. ...|$|R

In both years a bimodal pattern of stem radial increment was registered by band <b>dendrometers</b> with two periods of increment: one in spring and another in autumn.

40|$|Tree-ring {{formation}} of eastern white-cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) at a boreal lake in northwestern Quebec, Canada, was monitored using manual band <b>dendrometers</b> to (i) retrace cambial activity phases, (ii) evaluate {{the effects of}} flooding on radial growth, and (iii) analyze the relationships with meteorological factors. The daily circumferential activity of four trees at each of two sites, a riparian and an upland site, was recorded {{during the growing season}} of 1996, a year with an extreme spring flood. First cambium cell divisions occurred near June 9, followed by a distinct and sustained upward trend in the stem basal area until mid-July that reflected the earlywood formation. The strongly synchronous circumferential activity at both sites suggests no adverse flooding effect on growth of the riparian trees, which is explained by the rapid retreat of the water just before growth initiation in early June. The following month until mid-August was characterized by strong short-term fluctuations caused by alternating drought and rain periods and a slight downward trend of the basal area for six of the eight banded white-cedars. The <b>dendrometers</b> of two trees, the closest to the lake, showed a slight upward trend probably reflecting latewood formation. Pearson correlation with meteorological data indicated that precipitation was positively related to the daily changes in basal area of all trees except during the period of earlywood formation, which probably resulted from the high soil moisture after spring snow-melting. Mean and minimum air humidity were positively related and maximum temperature negatively related to the daily variations in stem circumference during the whole monitoring period, emphasizing the importance of the internal water status on stem size...|$|R

Combined data from the two sites showed that maximum radial growth rates occur in late spring (May), as soil temperature increases, and incoming short-wave radiation reaches its highest values.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{pressing}} questions involving ancient bristlecone pines are how microsite factors lead to differences in tree responses to climate at high-elevation sites, and how global change has impacted growing season events. Disparities in climate response at treeline and subalpine locations {{have been associated with}} local environmental characteristics while the increasing growth trend found at treeline has been linked to warming. In this study, environmental conditions were considered in order to identify microsite differences between trees growing at two different elevations on four aspects of a conical-shaped mountain in the White Mountains, California. Dendrochronological, environmental, correlational, and spectral methods were employed to explore differences in ring-width chronologies. Albedo, soil thickness, and percent slope led to ring-width variability. Northwestern upper site was most highly correlated with precipitation, while the Southeastern lower site showed a strong negative correlation with temperature. This work indicates that selection of climate-sensitive trees a priori necessitates the consideration of local environmental factors, and these microsite differences resulted in different climate responses between nearby trees. By monitoring growing season events at the historic phenology site from the 1962 - 64 (Fritts 1969), natural variations and responses to climate change can be identified. Morphological and physiological phenophases, <b>dendrometer</b> traces, and environmental data were collected throughout the summers of 2007 and 2008. Duration and timing of cambial activity (tracheid lifespan) {{in the present study were}} similar to those recorded in the Fritts (1969) investigation, while pollination onset and bud opening occurred earlier in this study. No change was found in duration and timing of cambial activity suggesting that changes in cambial phenology are not an explanation for the increasing growth trend found at upper forest borders. On the other hand, changes in bud opening and pollination onset may be related to recent warming. To monitor diurnal and seasonal stem variability as part of phenologic studies on several trees, a point potentiometer <b>dendrometer</b> was designed. The newly designed point potentiometer <b>dendrometer</b> was tested in multiple environments and found to be versatile, cost-effective, and portable, working well in semi-arid and arid environments...|$|E
40|$|In trees, stem {{diameter}} variations {{are related to}} changes in stem water content, because internally stored water is depleted and replenished over a day. To confirm this relationship, non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was combined with point <b>dendrometer</b> measurements in three actively transpiring oak (Quercus robur L.) trees. Two of these oak trees were girdled to study the stem increment above the girdling zone. MRI images and micrographs of stem cross-sections revealed a close link between the water distribution and the anatomical features of the stem. Stem tissues with the highest amount of water were physiologically the most active ones, being the youngest differentiating xylem cells, the cambium and the youngest differentiating and conductive phloem cells. Daily changes in {{stem diameter}} corresponded well with the simultaneously MRI-measured amount of water, confirming their strong interdependence. MRI images also revealed {{that the amount of}} water in the elastic bark tissues, excluding cambium and the youngest phloem, contributed most to the daily stem diameter changes. After bark removal, an additional increase in stem diameter was measured above the girdle. This increase was attributed not only to the cambial production of new cells, but also to swelling of existing bark cells. In conclusion, the comparison of MRI and <b>dendrometer</b> measurements confirmed previous interpretations and applications of dendrometers and illustrates the additional and complementary information MRI can reveal regarding water relations in plants...|$|E

The numbers of cells in the dividing (cambial) zone and subsequent stage of permanent enlargement were counted, based on increasing radial diameter and the onset of secondary thickening (determined by detecting birefringence in the cell wall) which was taken to indicate the end of enlargement.|$|R

Two study sites in Northern Labrador were chosen, one coastal (Nain), and the other inland (Kamestastin). In Nain, microcore samples were taken weekly from the same five white spruce (Picea glauca) trees over the 2014 growing season. After cross sections were made and stained, the resulting 10 µm thin radii provided a direct view of active ring development. In coastal Labrador, radial growth was initiated during the last week of June 2014, and ceased by August 25 th. Circumference band <b>dendrometers</b> were installed on white spruce trees at both the Nain and Kamestastin sites. The <b>dendrometers</b> were used to measure micrometre-scale changes over the 2014 growing season. Analogous records of temperature were collected with equal temporal resolution, from an Environment Canada climate station (# 8502800), and via a programmable data logger (UX 120 - 006 M, Onset HOBO). Correlation function analysis determined the relationship between daily temperature variables and daily variations in stem size. A strong relationship was found between minimum daily temperature and daily stem size at both sites over the eight week long growing season. Traditional dendrochronological sampling methods were utilized to retrieve tree cores from white spruce and eastern larch (Larix laricina) in Nain and Kamestastin. Site-specific master growth chronologies were created using crossdating and standardization techniques. After establishing long term records of monthly temperature and accumulated growing degree-days (GDD) at both study sites, a linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine the suitability of these two variables as predictors of annual-radial growth. An accumulated June/July GDD index was identified as an overall better predictor of annual ring-width than mean monthly temperature variables in northern Labrador. Exploring radial growth on an intra-annual scale helped to improve our understanding of the complex radial growth-climate relationship in Labrador. This allows for a strengthening of tree rings as a proxy climate indicator in remote regions of the northern boreal forest. The findings from this thesis provide the tools necessary to improve upon long-term climate reconstruction and forecasts of boreal forest structure in the face of climate change...|$|R
