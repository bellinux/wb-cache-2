5|$|Cnidocytes {{can only}} fire once, and about 25% of a hydra's nematocysts are lost from its tentacles when {{capturing}} a brine shrimp. Used cnidocytes <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced,</b> which takes about 48hours. To minimise wasteful firing, {{two types of}} stimulus are generally required to trigger cnidocytes: nearby sensory cells detect chemicals in the water, and their cilia respond to contact. This combination prevents them from firing at distant or non-living objects. Groups of cnidocytes are usually connected by nerves and, if one fires, {{the rest of the}} group requires a weaker minimum stimulus than the cells that fire first.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{found the}} Ionians {{difficult}} to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus {{was able to}} identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.|$|E
50|$|During {{installation}} on September 28, 1991, {{the first}} sculpture fell and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1984 the Barnes-side tower {{bearings}} failed under a {{heavy load}} and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{a recent}} break-in, {{some of the}} stained glass windows of the cathedral <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 3 September 1943, the British Eighth Army, {{under the}} command of General Bernard Montgomery, crossed the Straits of Messina from Sicily and landed in Calabria during Operation Baytown to seize the ports of Reggio and San Giovanni. The main {{invasion}} was planned for 9 September, with the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Clark, landing at Salerno on the western coast in Operation Avalanche, with Naples as their immediate objective. The Allies hoped that the invasion would persuade the Italian forces to surrender. If they did, the five Italian divisions in France and the twenty-nine in the Balkans would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by German formations. Also, if the Germans then decided to continue the fight in Italy, they would have to redeploy some of their troops engaged on the Eastern Front or on occupation duties in France.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also {{no guarantee that the}} valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in the crowded Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} their conquest, the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus identified elite native {{groups such as the}} priesthood of Judea – to help him rule his new subjects. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians. In the past, Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants, but that form of government was on the decline. Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place-men. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. On the eve of the Greco-Persian wars, it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontented and was ready for rebellion.|$|E
50|$|If {{the mast}} was gone altogether, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> with a jury rig {{assembled}} from whatever spars were available.|$|R
50|$|All four tyres <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of {{the same}} make and model, and all four tyres <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> {{at the same time}} — if one tyre was damaged or punctured, the three {{remaining}} good tyres also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> In addition there were other maintenance requirements which were both exacting and unusual. Neglect of these points through ignorance or a misconceived attempt <b>to</b> save money <b>was</b> common, and <b>was</b> likely <b>to</b> lead to very expensive failures of the transfer gearbox.|$|R
50|$|If the {{mainspring}} {{broke and}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced,</b> a frequent occurrence with early mainsprings, the fusee <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> readjusted <b>to</b> the new spring.|$|R
25|$|Fearing that O'Keefe might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> as compere, the Seven network renamed O'Keefe's TV show as Sing Sing Sing in February 1963 but its {{popularity}} continued.|$|E
25|$|The HSP46s {{continue}} to experience mechanical problems. Turbochargers failed in several locomotives beginning in Fall 2016, and will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> fleet-wide. Fleet availability fell to 27 of 40 in early April.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{brake blocks}} between the wheels that are {{pressed against the}} track when the gripman pulls a lever, {{bringing}} the car to a halt. The four blocks are made of Douglas fir (pine) and can produce a smell of burning wood when in operation. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> {{after just a few}} days.|$|E
50|$|During filming, monster suit actor Haruo Nakajima {{was injured}} by an {{explosives}} mishap and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> {{for the remainder}} of the shoot.|$|R
50|$|The church's organ's {{pipes and}} {{mechanism}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> in 2001, but Saint-Thiébaut still keeps its magnificent Gothic revival organ case of 1888.|$|R
50|$|During {{the fall}} of 2003, one of {{the legs of the}} Sentinel was cut off by a {{chainsaw}} and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by the artist.|$|R
25|$|These lights use {{about half}} {{of the power of the}} old bridge's lights and will last about 5 to 7 times longer. They will only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> every 10 to 15 years (compared to every 2 years with the old east span), {{reducing}} cost, improving worker safety and reducing traveler inconvenience due to lane closures.|$|E
25|$|Hobbyist aquaria {{often do}} not have {{sufficient}} bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> regularly.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev {{calls for}} a kind of perestroika or {{restructuring}} of societies around the world, starting in particular with that of the United States, because he is of the view that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 shows that the Washington Consensus economic model is a failure that will sooner or later <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> According to Gorbachev, countries that have rejected the Washington Consensus and the International Monetary Fund approach to economic development, such as Brazil and China, have done far better economically on the whole and achieved far fairer results for the average citizen than countries that have accepted it.|$|E
50|$|The church {{suffered}} {{fire damage}} during the 1945 Battle of Surabaya. Some {{of the original}} bricks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> with new ones, resulting in uneven coloration.|$|R
50|$|In November 2014, {{white poppy}} wreaths on the Aberystwyth War Memorial <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> after they <b>were</b> {{removed from the}} Memorial and thrown in a bin.|$|R
25|$|While {{in general}} every {{variable}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> {{with the same}} term in the whole tableau, there are some special cases in which this is not necessary.|$|R
25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} pinions, causing them to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's big ends were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined with dust and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the prime movers before they could be returned to service. The prime movers were manufactured in 1939 and their big ends had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|E
25|$|One design {{weakness}} of the two-fluid design is the necessity for a barrier wall between the core and the blanket region, a wall that would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> periodically because of fast neutron damage. Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the molten salts, high temperature resistance, and sufficient strength and integrity to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E
25|$|The ship's boilers {{were fired}} and {{within an hour}} the ship was making steam for getting underway. However, leaks due to frame and shaft damage contributed to delays in {{preparing}} the ship. By 1140 hours the ship was secured from attempts to get underway when it was finally determined she could not make more than 10 knots {{for no more than}} five hours. The ship was moved to dry dock on 8 December. It was found that the ship suffered considerable stress fractures within its engineering piping and tanks. All of these would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> or repaired stateside at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California. The ship sailed out of Pearl Harbor a few weeks later and she would not be fully repaired until the end of June 1942.|$|E
50|$|Since 1919, {{nearly all}} dignitaries visiting Hart House had signed its guest book. In 2007, the {{original}} leather-bound book finally {{ran out of}} pages and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1903 the {{building}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by larger premises {{and after a}} further two rounds of expansion, in 1931 Breuninger was operating on the new site on Marktstraße.|$|R
50|$|Lloyd {{had offered}} {{the part of}} the banker Matheson to his friend Joseph Cotten. However, {{scheduling}} difficulties meant that he also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced,</b> this time by Stewart Granger.|$|R
25|$|In 1997 the {{high-voltage}} cable issue {{was regarded as}} so severe that the company decided that they either would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> for the trams scrapped. On 12 September a tram lost its brakes and the following day all SM53 trams were taken out of service. Investigations showed that the braking systems {{would have to be}} rebuilt similar to SM83. This was too expensive and the trams never ran in revenue service again. One trailer received the new bogies for the SL95 and was hauled around Oslo by a SL79 for testing. The last of the non-preserved SM53s were scrapped in July 1998. Tram 259 was preserved as it was the only unit to have received a new cable. The only preserved trailer is no. 563, built by Strømmen.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} {{may need to}} be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E
25|$|Those in {{opposition}} of dam removal state that demolishing O'Shaughnessy Dam {{would take away}} a valuable source of clean, renewable hydroelectric power in the Kirkwood and Moccasin powerhouses; even if measures such as seasonal water diversion into the powerhouses were employed, it would only make up {{for a fraction of}} the original power production. The remaining deficit would likely <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by polluting fossil fuel generation. The removal of the dam would be extremely costly, at least $3–10 billion, and the transport of the demolished material away from the dam site along the narrow, winding Hetch Hetchy Road would be a logistical nightmare with possible environmental impacts. Most importantly, San Francisco would lose its source of high-quality mountain water, and would have to depend on lower-quality water from other reservoirs – which would require costly filtration and re-engineering of the aqueduct system – to meet its needs.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{much of the}} savanna's {{drainage}} system <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> The attraction remained open during the rehab, with green tarps covering the construction sites to keep the animals out.|$|R
50|$|Ray <b>was</b> meant <b>to</b> {{appear in}} My Sister Eileen as The Wreck but {{walked off the}} set {{claiming}} his role was too small, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> by Dick York.|$|R
50|$|Commissioners {{were also}} {{regularly}} threatened by former DDS personnel, scaring {{some of them}} away from doing their job, {{to the extent that}} three quarters of them <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> after six months.|$|R
