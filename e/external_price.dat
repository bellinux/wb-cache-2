50|$|The Paraguayan {{economic}} {{miracle of}} the 1970s {{came to a halt}} in 1982 because of the completion of construction at Itaipú, lower commodity prices for cotton and soybeans, and world recession. The economy recovered in 1984 and 1985, stagnated in 1986, and continued to expand in 1987 and 1988. Despite its rapid growth, the Paraguayan economy became increasingly dependent on soybeans and cotton for exports and overall economic dynamism. These two crops, however, remained subject to <b>external</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations and local weather conditions, both of which varied considerably.|$|E

5000|$|Cotton {{was one of}} Paraguay's oldest crops, grown {{since the}} time of the Jesuit missions. The {{government}} encouraged cotton production after the crop was nearly wiped out by the Paraguayan War. Cotton was especially suited to the Paraguayan climate and soils and was grown primarily by small farmers in the central region. Cotton farming also experienced extremely rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s. [...] In 1970 only 46,900 hectares were sown with cotton, producing a volume of over 37,000 tons. By 1985, however, 385,900 hectares were covered with cotton, yielding almost 159,000 tons. [...] Those figures had dropped to 275,000 hectares and 84,000 tons during the drought of 1986. [...] Foreign-owned, large-scale, commercial production in the eastern border region was surpassing central region production in the late 1980s. Despite the advances in cotton production, cotton cultivation in the 1980s was still characterized by low yields and a low technological level. Even more so than soybeans, cotton suffered wide price fluctuations, and many small farmers who came to rely on cotton revenues in the 1970s became vulnerable to <b>external</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations in the following decade. Some cotton fiber was used domestically, but about 80 percent of the country's crop was processed into cotton lint at more than ten textile-processing factories. [...] Cotton exports in 1987 earned about US$100 million, with most exports going to Uruguay, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan.|$|E

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of different sources of inflation in developing Asia. In particular, it tests the widely held view that the region's current inflation surge is primarily the result of <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks such as oil and food shocks. In addition, this paper also estimates the degree of pass-through of <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks to domestic prices. Our central empirical result is that contrary to popular misconception, Asia's inflation is largely due to excess aggregate demand and inflation expectations rather than <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks. This suggests monetary policy will remain a powerful tool in the fight against inflation in Asia. Another significant finding is that the pass-through of the <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks to domestic prices has been limited so far. However, the removal of government subsidies is likely to lead to greater pass-through in the future. The resulting inflationary pressures provide a further rationale for tightening monetary policy...|$|E

40|$|Reference prices, {{which are}} {{extensively}} used in retail advertisements, have received considerable research attention {{over the last}} 25 years. The present research looks at {{the extent to which}} an advertised, or <b>external,</b> reference <b>price</b> included in a price promotion affects consumers' price beliefs. According to Helson's Adaptation-Level theory, consumers form an internal reference price, which they use as a basis for evaluating market prices. The process by which internal reference price can change according to an <b>external</b> reference <b>price</b> is, then, explained by a conjoint Adaptation-Level and Assimilation-Contrast theories. It is suggested that consumers may assimilate or contrast an <b>external</b> reference <b>price</b> and that only an assimilated price has the ability to affect the internal reference price. A first experiment was conducted to examine the extent to which consumers assimilate an <b>external</b> reference <b>price.</b> Findings from the present research suggested that, contrary to the predictions of the Assimilation-Contrast theory, the impact of an <b>external</b> reference <b>price</b> on consumers' internal price standards was monotonic. It was further suggested that this assimilation might be moderated by individual differences. A second experiment was conducted to examine the differential effects of two types of semantic cues. However, in the research, no differences were found between absolute and relative savings presentation formats. Findings as well as several issues about the measurement of internal reference price, the effects of an exaggerated <b>external</b> reference <b>price</b> and the effects of price familiarity are discussed...|$|R

40|$|While {{consumer}} {{behavior and}} policy researchers {{have contributed to}} legislation and legal decisions for reference price advertising, there is hardly any research on how "other " <b>external</b> <b>price</b> information may impact the effects of reference prices and associated semantic cues. These issues are studied with two 3 x 2 x 2 experiments. Results of the first study indicate that consumer evaluations are influenced by "other " <b>external</b> <b>price</b> information within a plausible reference price range. In addition, presence of "other " <b>external</b> <b>price</b> information resulted in more positive perceptions of the offer when respondents were exposed to an abstract semantic cue. However, {{the results of the}} second study show that "other " <b>external</b> <b>price</b> information had no effect when the respondents were exposed to implausible or highly implausible prices, but the reference price level affected consumers ’ perceptions of value, attitude toward the deal, and Retail price promotion represents a major component of the marketing strategy for retail firms, with firms spending around $ 5 billion annually to advertise some form of price promotion (Friedmann and Haynes 1990).

Dual Transfer Prices with Unobserved Cost This paper examines the effectiveness of dual (non-zero-sum) transfer prices in a de-centralized firm, in terms of efficient internal trade and external price-setting incentives, when marginal costs are not observable and the upstream division has monopoly power in the external market. The main message of our paper is that when costs are not observed dual-transfer pricing is more complicated than it may appear, because the situation cannot be treated as two separate unrelated optimization problems. We {{would like to}} be able to use the information about cost embedded in the upstream <b>external</b> <b>price</b> to make the price faced by the downstream firm more efficient, but in so doing we may introduce incentives for the upstream division to distort the <b>external</b> <b>price.</b> We find that first-best internal trade and price-setting can be achieved in the special case when demand is observed by headquarters, but the optimal dual transfer prices can take a highly non-linear form. When demand is random and unobserved by headquarters, first-best internal trade is not possible and it is often optimal to use the upstream <b>external</b> <b>price</b> in the downstream transfer price because it is informative about marginal cost, even if this induces distortion in the <b>external</b> <b>price.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Time-varying {{exchange}} rate pass-through effects to domestic prices under fixed euro {{exchange rate}} perspective represent {{one of the}} most challenging implications of the common currency. The problem is even more crucial when examining crisis related redistributive effects associated with relative price changes. The degree of the exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices reveals its role as the <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks absorber especially in the situation when the leading path of exchange rates is less vulnerable to the changes in the foreign prices. Adjustments in domestic prices followed by exchange rate shifts induced by sudden <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks are associated with changes in the relative competitiveness among member countries of the currency area. In the paper we examine exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices in the Euro Area member countries to examine crucial implications of the nominal exchange rate rigidity. Our results indicate that absorption capabilities of nominal effective exchange rates clearly differ in individual countries. As a result, an increased exposure of domestic prices to the <b>external</b> <b>price</b> shocks in some countries represents a substantial trade-off of the nominal exchange rate stability...|$|E
40|$|NoPricing is a {{critically}} important management activity with major strategic and operational implications. However, pricing is a much-neglected and ineptly administered marketing responsibility, and numerous errors are made. A prime {{reason for this}} is that firms are preoccupied with the use of convenient, often singularly cost-based, pricing methods that fail to assimilate the impact of the full range of effective pricing determinants. This article introduces the concept of the pricing wheel that is a multistage process for effective price management. It provides a systematic means for analyzing and incorporating into decision making the strategic role of price, pricing objectives, the plethora of internal and <b>external</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants, pricing strategy, the pricing technique, and the necessary implementation and control procedures.

40|$|Purpose – Extant {{literature}} on pricing posits that consumers’ internal reference price (IRP) drives {{willingness to pay}} (WTP), when <b>external</b> <b>pricing</b> cues are available.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to test how the IRP-WTP relationship will be moderated by involvement and price consciousness, albeit in the pay-what-you-want (PWYW) context. In the PWYW setting consumers can pay any amount of money (including nothing) and no <b>external</b> <b>pricing</b> cues are provided. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was engaged to measure the key variables, and the data was analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression with spotlight analyses. Findings – In the normal everyday pricing context, involvement strengthens the IRP-WTP relationship, while price consciousness weakens it. Contrary to this normal pricing wisdom, in the PWYW context, it was found that both involvement and price consciousness weaken the IRP-WTP relationship, thereby driving down consumers’ WTP. Research limitations/implications – Future studies should use experimental design to manipulate some of the independent variables used in the study, focus on the mediating processes that underlie PWYW decision-making and extend the findings in the context of wider demographics.

This paper provides a model framework for such discussion. Three alternative monetary strategies are approximated by different policy rules. Several specific features of the Czech economy (such as its significant openness, administered price deregulation, and nominal convergence) are incorporated in the author?s model. Major shocks come from <b>external</b> <b>prices</b> and price corrections. Similarly, policy rules mirror strategies of monetary policy {{that are relevant to}} the Czech experience. For example, the standard inflation-targeting rule is modified by an imported equilibrium interest rate. Alternative definitions of aggressiveness regarding the exchange-rate rule correspond to changes in the width of the band.

Real wages in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America never showed any signs of catching up with the European industrial leaders prior to 1914 hold their own. The ratio of wages to land rents, on the other hand, declined up to World War I and so did the ratio of wages to GDP per capita. The trend reversed thereafter. These relative factor price movements help sharpen our understanding of the sources of growth (or lack of it) in Asia and Latin America prior to 1940.
