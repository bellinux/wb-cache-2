5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as <b>endoscopy</b> and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of <b>endoscopy</b> procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cholangiocarcinoma include abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss. Other symptoms such as generalized itching, fever, and changes in color of stool or urine may also occur. The disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests, imaging, <b>endoscopy,</b> and sometimes surgical exploration, with confirmation obtained after a pathologist examines cells from the tumor under a microscope. Known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), infection with the parasitic liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis, some congenital liver malformations, and exposure to Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), a chemical formerly used in medical imaging. However, most people with cholangiocarcinoma have no identifiable risk factors.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Barrett's {{oesophagus}} (BO) predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological {{data suggest}} that the incidence of BO is rising but it is unclear whether this reflects a true rise in incidence of BO or an increase in detection secondary to more upper gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> performed. This study aimed to examine the changes in BO incidence relative to the number of upper gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> performed in the general population. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using the Integrated Primary Care Information database. This general practice research database contains the complete and longitudinal electronic medical records of more than 500, 000 persons. RESULTS: In total, 260 incident cases of BO were identified during the study period. The incidence of BO increased from 14. 3 / 100, 000 person years in 1997 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 8. 6 - 22. 4) to 23. 1 / 100, 000 person years (95 % CI 17. 2 - 30. 6) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 87). The number of upper gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> decreased from 7. 2 / 1000 person years (95 % CI 6. 7 - 7. 7) to 5. 7 / 1000 person years (95 % CI 5. 4 - 6. 1) over the same time period. This resulted in an overall increase in detected BO per 1000 <b>endoscopies</b> from 19. 8 (95 % CI 12. 0 - 31. 0) in 1997 to 40. 5 (95 % CI 30. 0 - 53. 5) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 93). The incidence of adenocarcinoma increased from 1. 7 / 100, 000 person years (95 % CI 0. 3 - 5. 4) in 1997 to 6. 0 / 100, 000 person years (95 % CI 3. 3 - 10. 2) in 2002 (r 2 = 0. 87). CONCLUSION: The incidence of diagnosed BO is increasing, independent of the number of upper gastrointestinal <b>endoscopies</b> that are being performed. This increase in BO incidence will likely result in a further increase in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinomas in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Background: Colonoscopic {{screening}} for colorectal cancer is being implemented in {{an increasing number}} of countries. This might lead to a demand for colonoscopies that could outstrip supply. Objective: We wanted to investigate whether undergoing a colonoscopic examination for colorectal cancer would affect the utilization of later distal GI <b>endoscopies</b> for other indications than follow-up of the findings at the screening examination (usual-care <b>endoscopies).</b> Design: Prospective case control study. Patients: In 1996, a screening group of 634 individuals, aged 63 to 72 years, randomly drawn from the official population registry, was invited to a "once only" colonoscopic screening examination for colorectal cancer. A total of 451 individuals (71 %) attended. An age- and sex-matched control group of 634 individuals was enrolled from the same registry. Both groups belonged to the encatchment area of a single hospital. Main Outcome Measurements: Distal <b>endoscopies</b> performed in the 2 groups from January 1996 to November 2004 were registered by investigating medical records. Results: A total of 1268 individuals (52. 4 % women) were followed for 9 years. Sixty-three individuals (9. 9 %) in the screening group and 110 (17. 4 %) individuals in the control group (odds ratio 0. 53, 95 % confidence interval 0. 38 - 0. 73) had had a total of 85 and 169 usual-care distal <b>endoscopies,</b> respectively (P <. 001). Conclusions: Undergoing a colonoscopic examination for colorectal cancer seems to reduce the utilization of later usual-care endoscopic examinations. This finding could {{have an impact on the}} estimation of endoscopic resources needed for colorectal cancer screening. ...|$|R
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} <b>endoscopy</b> (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, <b>endoscopy,</b> or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
