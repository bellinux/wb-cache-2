50|$|In EGW, {{the heat}} of the welding arc causes the {{electrode}} and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded. This molten metal solidifies from the bottom up, joining the parts being welded together. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by a separate shielding gas, or by the gas produced by the disintegration of a flux-cored electrode wire. The electrode is guided into the weld area by either a consumable electrode <b>guide</b> <b>tube,</b> like the one used in electroslag welding, or a moving head. When the consumable <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> is used, the weld pool is composed of molten metal coming from the parts being welded, the electrode, and the <b>guide</b> <b>tube.</b> The moving head variation uses an assembly of an electrode <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> which travels upwards as the weld is laid, keeping it from melting.|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to axonal damage and limits {{the ability of}} the brain to {{communicate}} {{with the rest of the}} body. Several bioengineered approaches have been developed for the recovery of SCI. Among these techniques, degradable guidance tubes have shown promising results. However, design of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> requires several design considerations and has been a significant challenge. To assess the efficacy of a prototypical implanted nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes,</b> it is essential to perform continuous monitoring. In this respect, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most reliable imaging techniques as it offers the ability to achieve extraordinary high temporal and spatial resolution in addition to its non-invasive features. In spite of the excellent image quality of non-enhanced MRI various types of contrast agents have been developed to further enhance the contrast and allow improved visualization. The MRI contrast agents principally work by shortening the T 1 or T 2 relaxation times of protons located nearby. The presented study was intended to evaluate the in vitro degradation of the nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> made of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PLGA tubes incorporated with different concentrations of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) were scanned by MRI 3 T on weekly basis during the degradation period. Spin-echo (SE) sequence with various echo times (TEs) ranged from 13. 3 to 314. 4 msec was applied. T 2 mapping was computed using in-house algorithm developed in Matlab. Least square fit was used to find the slope of the decay curve by plotting log intensity on the y-axis and echo time on the x-axis. The average T 2 values were calculated. Mass loss and water uptake of the degrading tubes were also measured weekly. Moreover, the micro-structural changes of the tubes were investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The MRI results showed that the concentration of SPIO affects the signal intensity of the T 2 weighted images reducing the T 2 relaxation time value. Accordingly, a linear correlation between SPIO concentration and T 2 relaxation time was found. At the beginning of degradation, the SPIO nanoparticles were trapped within the polymeric network. Therefore, water penetration was the predominant factor affecting the T 2 relaxation times. At week 5, a significant mass loss was observed. From this stage onwards, the trapped SPIO were released from the polymeric network increasing T 2 relaxation time dramatically. According to SEM images, the size of the pores in PLGA <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> was increased with the degradation. Approaching the end of degradation, shrinkage of the tubes was observed and the degraded nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> were shown to be collapsed. Similar shape variation was observed in T 2 weighted MR images. In summary, this study provided an approach to non-invasive monitoring of degradation behavior of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> using contrast enhancement. The developed technique is of great importance since it opened an insight to non-invasive monitoring of tissue engineered scaffolds for in vivo studies...|$|R

The influence of reactor liquid filling on eigenfrequencies is evaluated analytically.

5000|$|Electroslag welding (ESW) is {{a highly}} productive, single pass welding process for thick (greater than 25 mm up to about 300 mm) {{materials}} in a vertical or close to vertical position. (ESW) is similar to electrogas welding, but the main difference is the arc starts in a different location. An electric arc is initially struck by wire that is fed into the desired weld location and then flux is added. Additional flux is added until the molten slag, reaching {{the tip of the}} electrode, extinguishes the arc. The wire is then continually fed through a consumable <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> (can oscillate if desired) into the surfaces of the metal workpieces and the filler metal are then melted using the electrical resistance of the molten slag to cause [...] The wire and tube then move up along the workpiece while a copper retaining shoe that was put into place before starting (can be water-cooled if desired) is used to keep the weld between the plates that are being welded. Electroslag welding is used mainly to join low carbon steel plates and/or sections that are very thick. It can also be used on structural steel if certain precautions are observed. This process uses a direct current (DC) voltage usually ranging from about 600 A and 40-50 V, higher currents are needed for thicker materials. Because the arc is extinguished, this is not an arc process.|$|E
40|$|For {{attaining}} {{a higher}} fueling efficiency in JT- 60 U centrifugal pellet injection experiments, guide tubes for a magnetic high-field side (HFS) injection were developed. The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> for HFS (top) injection is about l 5 m in length, 5 mm in inner diameter and 600 mm {{in the smallest}} curvature radius, and has been connected to the upper port of the vacuum vessel. The speed exceeding 220 m/s led to pellet destruction in the <b>guide</b> <b>tube,</b> while the injected pellet mass estimated from the increase of plasma density reached about 80 Vo of that from low-field side (LFS) injection.

40|$|Neutron <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are widely}} used to {{transport}} neutron beams over long distances. The neutron mirrors used to line the <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> have imperfect reflectivity and, in long conventional guides, {{the average number of}} reflections for neutron rays becomes large thus reducing the transmission. This issue is extremely important for modern spallation sources, especially for the proposed long pulse European Spallation Source to be constructed in Lund, Sweden, where technical constraints require many instruments to be far from the source. Several solutions to the problem of transporting neutrons over long distances have been proposed and currently the most favored model is that of guides with elliptic shapes. It is widely believed that elliptic guides transport neutron rays from source to sample with a single bounce, a near perfect solution for long neutron guides, and a view which is true in ideal circumstances. This article uses computed Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations VITESS and other techniques to demonstrate that transport of neutrons by realistic elliptic guides usually involves many reflections, contrary to the usual expectations. These multiple reflections explain the irregular divergence distributions observed in computer simulations of transmission by some elliptic guide...|$|R
