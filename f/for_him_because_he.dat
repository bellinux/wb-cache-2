5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not have the start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{was named}} the AL Pitcher of the Month in April, May, June and September 1999 – 4 times in a single season. Martínez punctuated his {{dominance}} in the 1999 All-Star Game start at Fenway Park, when he struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell in two innings. It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck out the side to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E
25|$|Bladel, {{a disgruntled}} former employee, {{had been arrested}} three months later in Indiana and extradited to Michigan. He had agreed {{to talk to the}} police without counsel. At his {{arraignment}} he requested that counsel be appointed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was indigent. The detective in charge of the investigation was present at the arraignment. A notice of appointment was then mailed to a law firm, but before the law firm received the notice, two police officers interviewed Bladel in the county jail and obtained a confession from him. Prior to that questioning, the officers had advised Bladel of his Miranda rights. Although Bladel had inquired about his representation several times since the arraignment, he was not told that a law firm had been appointed to represent him.|$|E

25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

Next, he defeated top-20 player Roberto Bautista Agut to guarantee a medal match. He played 2008 gold medalist and the 2016 doubles gold medalist, Rafael Nadal. He defeated him in three tight sets to guarantee a medal. Del Potro played in his first gold medal match against the reigning Wimbledon champion from the previous month, Andy Murray.

[...] It's the sound of a bottle of store-brand root beer falling off the shelf in a gas station minimart." [...] The segment closes with Oliver walking toward a lighted [...] "DRUMPF" [...] sign, informing those watching the segment who are considering voting for Trump, [...] "Don't vote <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> tells it like it is.

[...] When Amy is unsure whether or not to abort her baby, Stephen jested her first {{decision}} should be whether to change her mascara - [...] "I’ve seen less fuel-faced coal miners." [...] Stephen opined that it was obvious David was heading for trouble with [...] "gratingly Geordie Amy." [...] She said she had no sympathy <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> knowingly walked into Amy's [...] "maelstrom of rampant teen hormones."

500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was not the sort of person who people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E
500|$|The others discuss {{who shot}} Ron, and Tom creates a minor panic when he {{suggests}} perhaps an outsider is hunting them. Ann takes Leslie aside {{and says she}} knows who shot Ron, {{and a few minutes}} later Leslie admits to the group that she was the shooter, even though Ann knows this is not the case. A park ranger (Jay Johnston) arrives and interrogates Leslie, implying that the accident is the result of her femininity. Leslie knows that she is a good hunter, but goes along with the ranger's sexist implications in order to appease him. Later, a bandaged Ron repeatedly berates Leslie, prompting Ann to insist Tom come forward. Tom admits he shot Ron, and that Leslie covered <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not have his hunting license, which could have resulted in a $25,000 fine and prison time. Ron is impressed with Leslie, whom he calls a [...] "stand-up guy". The episode ends with a get well party for Ron, where Ann is unimpressed with Andy's hickey, and the whole party is horrified by Ron's head wound.|$|E

Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season. White said, [...] "Stephen outplayed me in safety, potting and position so he deserved to win" [...] and, [...] "He gave me a good bashing.

500|$|Gibbons said he {{deliberately}} {{constructed the}} visual look of Watchmen {{so that each}} page would be identifiable {{as part of that}} particular series and [...] "not some other comic book". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with [...] "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" [...] which he hoped [...] "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for [...] "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing". Gibbons described the series as [...] "a comic about comics". Gibbons felt that [...] "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [...] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." [...] The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, [...] "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not have to rely primarily on reference books.|$|E

2500|$|Villepin {{has never}} held elected office; the French Constitution allows the {{president}} to appoint unelected ministers.

He is also reported to despise elected officials, calling members of Parliament connards (assholes). Villepin is not the first [...] "unelected" [...] prime minister, even in the relatively short history of the Fifth Republic: notable predecessors include Georges Pompidou, who was a banker before being called to office, and Raymond Barre, who had a previous career as a professor and appointed official, and started an elected career only after being Prime minister.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{exception}} to this rule was the WrestleMania VI Ultimate Challenge title for title match between WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and the WWF Intercontinental Champion, The Ultimate Warrior. Since they were both fan favorites, Ventura took a neutral position in his commentary, even praising Hogan's display of sportsmanship {{at the end of}} the match when he handed over the WWF Championship belt to the Warrior after he lost the title, stating that Hogan was going out like a true champion. During the match, however, which was also the last match at Wrestlemania he called, Ventura did voice his pleasure when both broke the rules, at one point claiming, [...] "This is what I like. Let the two goody two-shoes throw the rule book out and get nasty." [...] Ventura's praise of Hogan's action was unusual <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> regularly rooted against Hogan during his matches, usually telling fellow commentator Monsoon after Hogan had won a championship match at a Wrestlemania that he might [...] "come out of retirement and take this dude out". Hogan and Ventura were at one point close friends. However, Ventura abruptly ended the friendship after he discovered, during his lawsuit against McMahon, that Hogan was the one who had told McMahon about Ventura's attempt to form a labor union in 1984. Following a dispute with McMahon over the use of his image for promoting a Sega product, McMahon—who had a contract with rival company Nintendo at the time—released Ventura from the company in August 1990.|$|E
