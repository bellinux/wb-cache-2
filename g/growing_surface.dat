5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the <b>growing</b> <b>surface.</b> It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae {{on the rim of}} the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying <b>growing</b> <b>surface,</b> improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain. Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the peridium opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the peridium of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations).|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the <b>growing</b> <b>surface.</b> The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E

40|$|Multifractal scaling {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} the <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of random deposition model. The effect of number of deposited particles and lattice size on multifractal spectra is studied. Three cases of the <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are considered: (1) Same total number of particles deposited on different square lattice so that the number of particles deposited per surface site is different. (2) Different total number of particles deposited on different square lattice so that the number of particles deposited per surface site is the same. (3) Different total number of particles deposited on same square lattice to study the effect of number of deposited particles on multifractal spectra. The multifractal spectra are related to the surface irregularity of the <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It has been observed that the surface with more surface roughness gives greater non-linearity in q–t(q) multifractal spectra results in wider range of a values in a–f(a) multifractal spectra...|$|R
40|$|Many living {{structured}} are coated by thin films, {{which have}} distinct mechanical properties from the bulk. In particular, these thin layers may grow faster or {{slower than the}} inner core. Differential growth creates a balanced interplay between tension and compression and plays {{a critical role in}} enhancing structural rigidity. Typical examples with a compressive outer surface and a tensile inner core are the petioles of celery, caladium, or rhubarb. While plant physiologists have studied the impact of tissue tension on plant rigidity for more than a century, the fundamental theory of <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> remains poorly understood. Here, we establish a theoretical and computational framework for continua with <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> and demonstrate its application to classical phenomena in plant growth. To allow the <b>surface</b> to <b>grow</b> independently of the bulk, we equip it with its own potential energy and its own surface stress. We derive the governing equations for <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of zero thickness and obtain their spatial discretization using the finite element method. To illustrate the features of our new surface growth model we simulate the effects of growth-induced longitudinal tissue tension in a stalk of rhubarb. Our results demonstrate that different growth rates create a mechanical environment of axial tissue tension and residual stress, which can be released by peeling off the outer layer. Our novel framework for continua with <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> has immediate biomedical applications beyond these classical model problems in botany: It can be easily extended to model and predict surface growth in asthma, gastritis, obstructive sleep apnoea, brain development, and tumor invasion. Beyond biology and medicine, surface growth models are valuable tools for material scientists when designing functionalized surfaces with distinct user-defined properties...|$|R

25|$|The {{specific}} epithet versutus {{is derived}} from the Latin word versut (clever), which may be a reference to the ability of the fungus to correctly orient itself for growth depending on the position of its <b>growing</b> <b>surface.</b> The basionym of this species is Agaricus versutus Peck 1878. Older, obsolete synonyms include Crepidotus bresadolae and Crepidotus pubescens.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "nest", or peridium, {{is usually}} about 7 to 10mm in height and 6 to 8mm in width, but the size is {{somewhat}} variable and specimens {{have been found}} with heights and widths of up to [...] The shape typically resembles a vase or inverted cone. The outer surface (exoperidium) ranges in color from slightly brownish to grayish buff to deep brown; the exoperidium has a shaggy or hairy texture (a tomentum), with the hairs mostly pointing downward. The inner surface of the peridium (the endoperidium) is striated or grooved, and shiny. Young specimens have a lid, technically called an epiphragm, a thin membrane that covers the cup opening. The epiphragm is hairy {{like the rest of}} the exoperidial surface, but the hairs often wear off leaving behind a thin white layer stretched across the lid of the cup. As the peridium matures and expands, this membrane breaks and falls off, exposing the peridioles within. The peridium is attached to its <b>growing</b> <b>surface</b> by a mass of closely packed hyphae called an emplacement; in C.striatus the maximum diameter of the emplacement is typically 8–12mm, and often incorporating small fragments of the <b>growing</b> <b>surface</b> into its structure.|$|E
30|$|So far, {{the nature}} of nonmonotonic {{temperature}} dependence of transition 2 D- 3 D thickness is not clear. It was shown in the article [13], that the mobility of Ge atoms on the Si(111) surface increases by several orders of magnitude with a Sn coverage of about one monolayer. Owing to this fact, the Ge 0.96 Sn 0.04 films seem to grow by the moving atomic steps at relatively low growth temperatures. As long as Sn atoms in <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> act as surfactants for Ge adatoms, the surface diffusion of Ge atoms on a Si(100) surface will increase. The quantity of Sn atoms at <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> may increase because {{of the effect of}} Sn segregation. The characteristics of segregation and temperature dependence of Sn segregation during the growth process of the Ge-Sn film are not found in literature.|$|R
50|$|Microscopically, P. guttata is {{characterized}} by large ascomata, long narrow pointed appendages with bulbous swellings at base, 2- or 3-spored asci with large ascospores; the ascomata also have gelatinous cells with tufts of hyphae somewhat resembling hairs. The cleistothecia are capable of dissemination and attachment to new <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> by means of gelatinous penicillate cells.|$|R

500|$|The {{fruit body}} {{projects}} out horizontally from the <b>growing</b> <b>surface.</b> If {{the position of}} a log is altered after young fruit bodies with the beginnings of gills have appeared, the stems of these attempt to readjust themselves in order to place the cap in a horizontal position. The cap are sometimes [...] (marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones); this depends on changes in the humidity of the environment, as variations in the amount of moisture will cause alternating periods of acceleration or slowing of growth.|$|E
500|$|The {{perennial}} fruit {{bodies of}} A.serialiformis are effused-reflexed (that is, on a vertical surface that is partially lying {{flat on the}} substrate with the hymenium covering the upper surface, and partially pileate). In its upper part it has small caps that are often elongated along the <b>growing</b> <b>surface,</b> up to [...] or more in length, with a tough texture. The individual caps, which reach dimensions of up to [...] by , have roughly horizontal upper surfaces that are velvety, and brownish with a narrow white margin. On {{the underside of the}} cap, the pore surface is initially white, but turns dirty brown as it matures. The individual pores are round and small, numbering from 3 to 4 per millimeter. The tubes are the same color as the pore surface, and up to [...] deep. The flesh is white and up to 1mm thick. Fruit bodies are often infested with microlepidoptera species, which causes the pore surface to be powdery.|$|E
500|$|The {{resemblance}} that Cyathus helenae bears to {{a miniature}} bird's nest with eggs {{is the source}} for its common name, bird's nest fungi. The fruit body, or peridium, of C.helenae is obconic, that is, shaped roughly like an inverted cone. The upper third of the peridium is flared outwards sharply, and the opening is normally 5–6mm wide, while {{the height of the}} fruit body is 7mm. The outer surface of the peridium, the ectoperidium, is pale brown to grey in color, and covered with clusters of fungal hyphae that resemble hairs. These hairs appear to be aggregated into clusters ("nodular"), and generally point downward. The inner surface of the peridium, the endoperidium, is smooth with a grey to silver and somewhat shiny surface. This inner surface also has faint but distinct vertical ridges, known as plications. Like many other Cyathus species, the cup is attached to its <b>growing</b> <b>surface</b> by a clump of mycelium called an emplacement; in C.helenae the diameter of the emplacement is typically wider than that of the peridium, and it often incorporates bits of [...] "organic trash".|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that certain {{materials}} show a granular structure in their surfaces, with hills of several heights and lateral extensions. Thermodynamic and kinetic determine how the film surface develops. Thermodynamic dictates the growing process, layer by layer, islanding or by a mixed mechanism. Kinetic plays an equally important role since island nucleation and growth is controlled by surface diffusion. There are several ways of <b>growing</b> a <b>surface.</b> One of them is the ballistic-aggregation model [1] in which each particle added to the surface uses a linear trajectory with randomly selected direction to determine the final position. Another model is the Eden growth model [2] where particles are deposited on any point of the surface with equal probability. It is possible, as well, to describe the dynamic of <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> by continual equations. Kardar, Parisi and Zhang (KPZ) [3] proposed a nonlinear differential equation which gives interfacial growth exponents consistent with numerical simulations of ballistic aggregation and Eden growth. The main effort studying <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been done experimentally [4, 5]. We propose a simulation method to study the local behaviour of <b>growing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This simulation is based on thermodynamic principles and uses two parameters: the energy increment E 0, obtained by having another atom in the position of a first neighbours, and the diffusion length average at the selected temperature. It is possible to obtain the probability that an atom in a determined position can move to a close position. This is the elemental diffusion probability, p, and depends on the diffusion length average, λ. The bounding energy normalized to the thermal energy in a particular position is given / a by p = 1 / 2, where a is the cell parameter. We define, as well, k as a vector with the form k=a(u λ x,uy,uz), where components ui can value 1, 0,- 1. The bonding energy normalized to the thermal energy is given by: E k 0 ε (r) = ∑ δ (r + k) (1) k T a wher...|$|R

500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.echinatum are [...] wide by [...] tall, and are roughly spherical, or pear-shaped. The {{exterior}} surface {{is crowded with}} spines that may be up to [...] long. According to Curtis Gates Lloyd, American specimens have more slender spines than European ones. Initially white and becoming dark brown in maturity, the spines are often joined at the tips in groups of three or four. In this form the puffballs resemble acorn caps of burr oak, with which they may readily be confused. The spines slough off in age, revealing a somewhat net-like or reticulated surface. The fruit body has a small base that is an off-white or purple-gray color, {{and it may be}} attached to the <b>growing</b> <b>surface</b> by thin white cords (rhizomorphs). The internal contents of the puffball contain the gleba, a mass of spores and associated spore-producing cells. In young specimens the gleba is white and firm, but as the puffball ages, it turns yellowish and then brown to purple-brown and powdery. Mature specimens develop a pore {{at the top of the}} fruit body through which spores are released when hit by falling raindrops.|$|E
500|$|This fungus is {{characterized}} by a fruiting body (technically an apothecia) with a pinkish-purple color and more or less gelatinous consistency. The apothecia, typically [...] in diameter, start with a roughly spherical shape, then eventually flatten out to become shallowly cup-shaped with a wavy edge and smooth upper surface. The lower surface may be covered with small particles (granular), and the apothecia are either attached directly to the <b>growing</b> <b>surface</b> (sessile), or have a rudimentary stem. The apothecia are accompanied by a conidial form, where non-sexual spores are generated. The conidial form consists of sporodochia, a cushion-like asexual fruiting body mass consisting of short conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia). The sporodochia are similar in color and consistency to the apothecia but very variable in shape, typically club-, spoon-, or tongue-shaped, and bearing minute, cylindrical, straight or curved conidia. As the fungus matures and the apothecia enlarge and press against each other, the apothecia coalesce to form a gelatinous, irregular mass. [...] The flesh, similar to the appearance of the fungus, is pinkish-purple and gelatinous. The odor and taste of A.sarcoides are not distinctive. Ascocoryne sarcoides is not considered edible.|$|E
