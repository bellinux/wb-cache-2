40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of selecting machines for non-conform and damaged <b>hazelnuts</b> and to enhance the numerical modelling of anisotropic behaviour of <b>hazelnuts,</b> the mechanical properties of shells and kernels are useful experimental data. A procedure to experimentally obtain physical and mechanical properties of <b>hazelnuts</b> is described and the optimized specimen shapes to obtain stress to failure and elastic modulus values for kernel and shell are also defined. The procedure is applied to a commercial variety of Italian <b>hazelnuts</b> and the mechanical properties are experimentally obtained both for kernel and shell on specimens made from conform and damaged <b>hazelnuts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Roasted <b>hazelnuts</b> consumpt oxygen while {{aging and}} rancidity will grow up. The {{analysis}} of oxygen-consumption allows to give {{information about the}} expected quality for <b>hazelnuts</b> and products containing <b>hazelnuts</b> stored under normal conditions, after few days. The two new descripted methods supply the other methods to estimate quality of hazelnuts: The analysis of triglycerides is useful for raw unroasted <b>hazelnuts,</b> the measurement of oxygen-consumption for roasted <b>hazelnuts.</b> Both methods are measuring the actual quality or nedd only very short storage-time for analysis. These are the advantages compared with many other methods. Oxydations-products (e. g. Hexanal or Heptenal) only can be analysed significantly after aging of <b>hazelnuts.</b> But in practice {{it is important to}} have an early information about the stability of raw material, semi-product and fresh produced products...|$|R

50|$|The second process {{involves}} the <b>hazelnuts.</b> Once the <b>hazelnuts</b> {{have arrived at}} the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A guillotine is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior. After this process, the <b>hazelnuts</b> are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch. This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 <b>hazelnuts</b> {{can be found in}} each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.|$|R
5|$|Hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), most {{commercial}} {{varieties of}} which descend from the European <b>hazelnut</b> (Corylus avellana). Hazelnuts {{are used to}} make pralines, in the popular Nutella spread, in liqueurs, and in many other foods.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other species}} are edible, but not commercially {{cultivated}} to any significant extent. These include the cold-tolerant Siberian <b>hazelnut</b> (C. heterophylla), C. kweichowensis, which {{grows in the}} warmer parts of China, C. sieboldiana, which grows in Japan and China, and other minor Corylus species.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides were {{originally}} {{settled in the}} Mesolithic era and have a diversity of prehistoric sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800BC. This find may indicate {{the presence of a}} summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt <b>hazelnut</b> shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hazelnuts</b> {{are widely}} used into the confectionary {{industry}} for their flavour and taste. Nondestructive techniques are required to detect {{the quality of the}} nuts in shell with the aim of avoiding putting a poor product into the market chain. In this work, Time Domain-NMR (TD-NMR) has been employed to detect hidden defects in <b>hazelnuts</b> in shell. In particular, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) technique has been used to evaluate the transverse relaxation times, T 2, for healthy and unhealthy <b>hazelnuts,</b> highlighting the differences between them. An index that takes in account the different time constants of the transverse relaxation curve has been defined to establish a classification method for the <b>hazelnuts.</b> The results of this work provide a basis {{for the development of a}} measurement system for inline inspection of <b>hazelnuts</b> in shell...|$|R
40|$|Fresh {{and stored}} <b>hazelnuts</b> were {{analyzed}} {{by means of a}} static headspace gas chromatography. During staling of <b>hazelnuts</b> a lot of volatile compounds are developed wich arise from lipid oxidation. As hexanal ist quantitatively a main compound it may be used as an analytical key-component although it doesnït strongly contribute to the rancid smell. Headspace results were compared with the results of a total flavour analysis and of the measurement of the oxygen consumption of whole <b>hazelnuts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{influence on}} stability of some sorts of <b>hazelnuts</b> (e. g. Oregon) or of kernels with small diameters {{depend on the}} high amount of linolic-acid-containing triglycerides. The composition of these triglycerides can be analyzed by HPLC according to an application of cocoabutter. By this analytical technique the quality of shelf-life of products made of raw <b>hazelnuts</b> can be estimated. The analysis of triglycerides give no information about the earlier treatment of <b>hazelnuts,</b> e. g. damage caused by not ideal or by long storage conditions, by mechanical damage or by not optimal roasting conditions. More information - especially {{about the quality of}} roasted <b>hazelnuts</b> - is given by the measurement of oxygen-consumption. This part will be reported in a following second application...|$|R
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and <b>hazelnut</b> brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{toothpaste}} tube manufacturer Betts {{opened a}} factory at No.505 Ipswich road in 1953. In 2008, the firm decided {{to close the}} factory and moved to smaller premises elsewhere in town. In 2014, Bellway Homes announced they would convert the former Ipswich Road factory into a housing estate named Avellana Place. Locals protested against the name, which is Spanish for <b>hazelnut,</b> saying a more appropriate name would be after the 1944 Lancaster Bomber crash.|$|E
5|$|A charred <b>hazelnut</b> shell, {{recovered}} in 2007 during excavations in Tankerness on the Mainland has been dated to 6820–6660 BC indicating {{the presence of}} Mesolithic nomadic tribes. The earliest known permanent settlement is at Knap of Howar, a Neolithic farmstead {{on the island of}} Papa Westray, which dates from 3500 BC. The village of Skara Brae, Europe's best-preserved Neolithic settlement, {{is believed to have been}} inhabited from around 3100 BC. Other remains from that era include the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Maeshowe passage grave, the Ring of Brodgar and other standing stones. Many of the Neolithic settlements were abandoned around 2500 BC, possibly due to changes in the climate.|$|E

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella <b>hazelnut</b> spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned <b>hazelnut</b> shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|Farm Fields, a {{site near}} Kinloch, {{provides}} some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. Carbonized <b>hazelnut</b> shells found there have been dated to the Mesolithic period at 7700-7500 BC.; at this time the landscape was dominated by alder, hazel and willow scrub. A beach site above Loch Scresort has been dated to between 6500 and 5500 BC. The presence of this hunter-gatherer community may have been {{to take advantage of the}} local supplies of bloodstone, a workable material for the making of tools and weapons. There is a shell-midden at Papadil in the south and evidence of tidal fish traps at both Kinloch and Kilmory.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hazelnuts</b> {{were grown}} on a {{naturally}} cover-cropped plor rather than tilled soil and then harvested either {{with a single}} or a double harvest. The data collected showed that the double harvest technique with cover crop enhanced the quality and state of preservation of <b>hazelnuts.</b> The costs regarding both growing techniques were estimated and {{it was determined that}} the double harvest and single harvest had the same costs, while cover cropping was economically advantageous in comparison to tillage. The fresh <b>hazelnuts</b> were stored for six months in order to evaluate their qualitative characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of shelling machines, and to enhance the numerical modelling of anisotropic behaviour of <b>hazelnuts</b> shells, the mechanical properties of shells are useful experimental data. A procedure to obtain an effective numerical model and to calibrate anisotropic material properties by means of experimental testing is described. The procedure was applied to a commercial variety of Italian <b>hazelnuts</b> and the mechanical properties were experimentally obtained for shell on specimens obtained from conform <b>hazelnuts.</b> The numerical finite element model investigates single and double curvature geometry simulation performance of the shell specimen...|$|R
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, <b>hazelnut,</b> vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from treeless heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European beech (Fagus sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that {{what he described as}} spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with <b>hazelnut</b> (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California <b>hazelnut,</b> bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
50|$|The {{sites are}} {{currently}} thought to represent specialised storage camps of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer groups at which {{large quantities of}} <b>hazelnuts</b> were processed. Duvensee lake was visited for approximately two weeks per year during late summer or early autumn in order to harvest and process <b>hazelnuts.</b> The archaeological evidence implies evidence for cracking, roasting and grinding of <b>hazelnuts</b> as well as extensive production of stone tools. There {{is no evidence that}} the sites served as actual living structures or longer-term settlements - spatial analyses indicate that nut processing activities took place in the open.|$|R
40|$|Microbial contamination, seed browning, {{bad taste}} and lipid {{oxidation}} are primary causes of quality deterioration in stored <b>hazelnuts,</b> affecting their marketability. The feasibility of NIR spectroscopy to detect flawed kernels and estimate lipid oxidation in in-shell and shelled <b>hazelnuts</b> was investigated. ‘Mortarella’ <b>hazelnuts</b> were measured twice by NIR spectroscopy, first in-shell, {{and then as}} kernels. Afterwards, the kernels were evaluated visually, externally and internally, and by sensory evaluation with a subsequent measurement of fat oxidation. A satisfactory PLS model was created {{for the detection of}} flawed kernels. For lipid oxidation estimation the best performance of PLS models was obtained by first removing the flawed kernels from the calibration set. The PLS model for the K 232 extinction coefficient, that is indicative of lipid primary oxidation, was able to predict K 232 for both in-shell (R 2 = 0. 79) and shelled (R 2 = 0. 85) <b>hazelnuts.</b> Our results suggest, for shelled <b>hazelnuts,</b> a two-step NIR procedure: a first PLS model to detect and separate flawed kernels and then a second PLS model to grade healthy kernels by lipid oxidation levels...|$|R
