40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{processor}} scheduling for n parallel jobs applying the method of competitive analysis. We prove that for <b>jobs</b> <b>with</b> a single phase of parallelism, a preemptive scheduling algorithm without information about job execution time can achieve a mean completion time within 2 − 2 2 times the optimum. In other words, we prove a competitive ratio of 2 − n+ 1 n+ 1. The result is extended to <b>jobs</b> <b>with</b> multiple phases of parallelism (which {{can be used to}} model <b>jobs</b> <b>with</b> sublinear speedup) and to interactive <b>jobs</b> (<b>with</b> phases during which the job has no CPU requirements) to derive solutions guaranteed to be within 4 − 4 times the optimum. In comparison n+ 1 with previous work, our assumption that job execution times are unknown prior to their completion is more realistic, our multiphased job model is more general, and our approximation ratio (for <b>jobs</b> <b>with</b> a single phase of parallelism) is tighter and cannot be improved.
