50|$|Marine <b>fenders</b> {{are used}} at ports and docks on quay walls and other {{berthing}} structures. They absorb the kinetic {{energy of a}} berthing vessel and thus prevent damage to the vessel or the berthing structure. There are 2 major categories of <b>fenders</b> for port applications: Fixed and Floating. Fixed <b>fenders</b> are mounted to the berth structure and compose of buckling <b>fenders</b> such as cell <b>fenders,</b> V-type <b>fenders,</b> and non-buckling <b>fenders</b> such as cylindrical <b>fenders.</b> Floating <b>fenders</b> are placed between the berth structure and ship, and include pneumatic <b>fenders</b> and foam-filled <b>fenders.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary {{models were}} the first <b>Fender</b> Japan models to be {{exported}} as <b>Fender</b> Stratocasters and Telecasters. The previous <b>Fender</b> Japan models exported from Japan were all <b>Fender</b> Squier models. The <b>Fender</b> Contemporary models were manufactured from 1984 to 1987 by FujiGen Gakki and these Stratocasters were designed to be Superstrats (Super Strat) with humbucking pickups and Floyd Rose like tremolos made by Schaller and Kahler.

50|$|The Frederiksted Pier (officially named: Ann E. Abramson Marine Facility) is the 1,526-foot (0.465 km or 0.29 mile), deep water, {{cruise ship}} pier located in Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands. It {{is located at}} the west end of Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and {{accommodate}} two eagle-class vessels, weighing a maximum of 142,000 gross tons each with drafts up to 29 feet and two mini-cruise vessels with drafts of 18 feet. Anchorage is also available in the outer harbor for larger ships. The platform of the pier is equipped with a <b>fendering</b> system that is designed for submarines.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifeboats}} onboard equipment {{includes the}} latest in electronic equipment including radar, a chart plotter and VHF radio direction finding equipment. Running around {{the outside of the}} hull is an inflatable tube constructed of tough Nylon weave. This tube, or Sponson is made up of separate compartments. If one of the compartments is accidentally punctured then the others will remain inflated. Should all the compartments become compromised the lifeboat would still be capable of floating without the sponson. The sponson allowing the boat to operate in rough seas and provides <b>fendering</b> when going alongside other vessels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{design of the}} Tasman Bridge provided impact absorbing <b>fendering</b> to the pile caps of the main navigation span capable of withstanding a glancing collision by a large ship, but all other piers were unprotected. This disaster shares some common features with the Skyway Bridge collapse in Florida in 1980, and the I-40 Bridge Disaster in Oklahoma in 2002, both involving collisions with ships. When river traffic [...] "comprises large vessels, even at low speed, the consequences of pier failure can be catastrophic". In the field of structural engineering, the concept of ‘pier-redundant’ bridges refers to a bridge superstructure which does not collapse when a single pier is removed. Two ‘pier-redundant’ bridges have been constructed in Australia - over the Murray River at Berri and at Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. The probability of ship impact is now regularly evaluated by specialist consultants when designing major bridges. One solution is to protect bridge piers through strengthening or the construction of impact-resistant barriers ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Fender</b> {{was also}} losing sales in Japan to Japanese guitar brands such as Tōkai, Greco and Fernandes and the {{establishment}} of <b>Fender</b> Japan would benefit <b>Fender</b> sales in Japan, as well as overseas. <b>Fender</b> began negotiations with several Japanese musical instrument distributors and reached an agreement with Yamano Gakki and Kanda Shokai to establish <b>Fender</b> Japan. Yamano Gakki was known for once being part of Epiphone Japan. Kanda Shokai owned the Greco brand name and one of the conditions of the <b>Fender</b> Japan agreement was that Kanda Shokai cease production of its own Greco <b>Fender</b> copies. This arrangement benefited <b>Fender</b> because it removed the Greco <b>Fender</b> copies from the Japanese market, which were selling in Japan at much lower prices than the American made <b>Fenders</b> and it also benefited Kanda Shokai because Kanda Shokai could then distribute Japanese made <b>Fender</b> branded guitars in Japan. Further negotiations between <b>Fender</b> and Japanese guitar factories took place. Tokai was seriously considered to start building the first Japanese made <b>Fenders,</b> but after a breakdown in negotiations, FujiGen Gakki was chosen instead.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fendering</b> {{systems are}} widely used in {{offshore}} installations for attenuating {{the effects of the}} impact energy of ships and barges in berthing or moored conditions. This study focuses on investigating current design practices and, developing a rational and functional approach to address random loading effects exerted on <b>fendering</b> systems. These loadings are often a consequence of combined wind, wave and current excitation as well as more controlled vessel motions. Dimensional analysis is used to investigate the degree to which empirical design data can be collapsed and to provide an indication of the nonlinearity associated with the empirical data for fender sizing. In addition, model test data specifically measuring the normal fender force for a coupled mini-TLP/Tender Barge performed at the Offshore Technology Research Center (OTRC) model basin is used in this research investigation [...] This data was characterized in terms of the typical statistical moments, which include the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. The maxima and extreme values are extracted from the fender response data based upon a zero-crossing analysis and the results were studied {{in order to determine the}} underlying probability distribution function. Using selected parameter estimation techniques, coefficients of a best-fit two parameter model were determined. An illustrative example is presented and discussed that contrasts the deterministic and probabilistic models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Generational {{relations}} and entrepreneurialism in organizations are attracting increasing attention from organizational scholars. This article bridges these areas of interest, by examining how entrepreneurial identity {{is shaped by}} generational encounters within a small organization context. In so doing, it contributes to ongoing challenges to the scientistic orthodoxy regarding the formation of entrepreneurial persons. Evidence from an ethnographic study of two joint ownermanagers in the port <b>fendering</b> industry is presented. Wenger’s ‘community of practice ’ framework is used to show that generational encounters, through their influence on self-identity, are an important social context {{of the decision to}} embark on an entrepreneurial career. By emphasizing micro-socially situated aspects of identity formation, this article provides an interactionist complement to recent accounts of entrepreneurs and identities as being (re) produced by discourses that have hegemonic effects. Key words. generations; entrepreneurs; identity; community of practice Ever since the publication of Karl Mannheim’s famous essay ‘The Problem of Generations ’ (1952 [1928]), generational differences and their social effects have been a consistent, but specialized, concern within sociology.

40|$|In history {{harbours}} were {{places of}} 'natural' shelter, ships could be safely anchored, however {{loading and unloading}} facilities were generally non existent apart from human labour. On the other hand ports are man made places of shelter purpose built for efficient transfer of cargo. The distinction between the words harbour and port is not always clear cut, obviously many of today's ports once started out as harbours. In the past and nowadays ports {{play an important role}} in world trade, they are part of a logistic chain transporting cargoes all over the world. Four main cargo commodities can be distinguished, viz. containers, liquid and dry bulk, and breakbulk or general cargo. The difference shows in the type of vessel being used for maritime transport, the type of handling equipment and storage within the port, and the type of hinterland transport. General reference is made to the courses CT 4330 and CT 5306 on Ports and Waterways. The port has to provide shelter and facilities for cargo transfer. The subject of these lecture notes is the port infrastructure that is predominantly required for cargo transfer, i. e. quays and jetties. One could always argue that (e. g.) a breakwater provides the necessary protection to be able to moor a ship along a jetty, however, the breakwater will not unload the LNG carrier whilst there will always be a weather window allowing the LNG carrier being handled at the jetty. Nowadays port infrastructure types will be described and discussed with regard to structural design and wherever possible a glimpse on the future will be revealed as developments do not stop. Some specific subjects like <b>fendering</b> and scour in front of the port structures will be dealt with as well. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|E

50|$|Cell <b>fenders</b> {{are best}} {{employed}} for small or large vessels where reaction force {{is an important}} criterion. Among all types of <b>fenders,</b> cell <b>fenders</b> offer minimum reaction per ton-meter energy absorbed. The very geometric shape gives it sturdiness, shear resistance, compact structure {{and the capacity to}} absorb energy equally from all directions. The Cylindrical buckling column absorbs axial loads effectively and buckles radially. This results in multi-directional dispersion of energy. Cell <b>fenders</b> are the most durable rubber <b>fenders</b> available and are currently the largest moulded <b>fenders</b> made. 2000-2500 mm high cell <b>fenders</b> are typically used for LNG berths. In order to distribute the reaction force, cell <b>fenders</b> are typically supplied with large <b>fender</b> panels, which keeps the hull pressure low.|$|R
