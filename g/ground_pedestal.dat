50|$|Jade Signature is a {{high-rise}} residential building in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, {{and is the}} fourth Jade building developed by Fortune International Group after the adjacent Jade Beach and Jade Ocean and the Jade at Brickell Bay in Miami. The building has a three storey below grade parking garage with 425 spaces instead of an above <b>ground</b> parking <b>pedestal.</b> Underground parking in South Florida is rare and difficult to construct due to the very low elevation and high water table, especially on the beach. This gives it a more approachable ground level street interface, with the main building and its amenities beginning at ground level.|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{study has}} been made of the high-latitude impulsive events that were observed during the 1985 - 1986 South Pole Balloon Campaign. The events were selected by searching for unipolar pulses {{greater than or equal to}} 10 nT above background in the vertical component of the magnetic field on the <b>ground</b> and/or <b>pedestal</b> or 'W' shaped horizontal electric field perturbations greater than or equal to 10 mV/m in amplitude and accompanied by perturbations in the vertical electric field at balloon altitude. A main event list comprising 112 events was compiled from the 468 hours of data available. Three aspects of the events were examined: the solar wind conditions prior to the event, local time of observation, and intrinsic properties of the events. The local time distribution was obtained from the 112 entry main event list and was found to be nearly uniform across the dayside, with no midday gap. The event rate found using our low-amplitude selection criteria was 0. 7 event/hr, comparable to expectations based on in situ studies of the magnetopause. A total of 42 events were found for which data were available from Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) 8. Of these events, 12 occurred when the Z(sub GSM) component (B(sub Z)) of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was northward and 30 occurred when B(sub Z) was southward or fluctuating. Only three of the B(sub Z) northward cases and only five of the B(sub Z) southward cases were preceded by pressure pulses greater than 0. 4 nPa in amplitude. Ten of the events were studied in detail by means of a model-fitting method discussed elsewhere. This method infers values of several parameters, including the total current flowing in a coaxial or monopole system and a two-dimensional dipole system. The intrinsic properties of the events showed that only approximately 10 % of the total current contributed to momentum transfer to the high-latitude ionosphere, that the direction of the motion depended more on local time of observation than IMF B(sub y), and that events were usually several hundred kilometers in size. The observed B(sub z) control found in the 42 event list and the prevalence of coaxial current dominated events are inconsistent with the predictions of the pressure pulse model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Large monumental constructions were a {{prominent}} feature in ancient Sri Lanka. Construction materials and techniques {{used in the}} past can be of significant interest to the modern engineer. The evolution of brick sizes during four ancient periods of Sri Lanka spanning from 375 B. C to 1350 A. D. was studied by using recorded data of bricks found on ancient construction sites. The calculated ratios and the relationships indicate that the length was relatively significant in the reduction of the brick sizes while breadth and thickness changed roughly in proportion to the length at a lower rate. The effect of ground condition, i. e. rock, strong soil and weak soil; and the effect of pedestals on a solid hemispherical dome type Stupa were analysed using SAP 2000. It was found that a stupa, if unrestrained along its horizontal directions, could experience tension being developed at the centre when built on a weak soil. Also, when constructed on poor <b>ground</b> conditions a <b>pedestal</b> reduces the compressive stresses at the base. However, the pedestal causes higher hoop and radial tensile stresses closer to {{the top and bottom of}} the outer surface of the dome. Vaulted structures in Sri Lanka exhibit approximately similar span to wall thickness ratios, thus indicating the possibility of the design being governed by the geometry of the structure. Also the development of stresses in vaulted structures indicates that the maximum vertical stress is compressive at the base, while the maximum tensile stress is at the crown intrados...|$|R
6000|$|Miriam, in {{the full}} swing of her part, paused but for an instant and let herself ring out again, while Peter sank into the nearest chair and she fixed him with her illumined eyes, that is, {{with those of the}} raving Constance. Madame Carré, buried in a chair, kissed her hand to him, and a young man who, near the girl, stood giving the cue, stared at him over the top of a little book. [...] "Admirable, magnificent, go on," [...] Sherringham repeated--"go on {{to the end of the}} scene, do it all!" [...] Miriam's colour rose, yet he as quickly felt that she had no {{personal}} emotion in seeing him again; the cold passion of art had perched on her banner and she listened to herself with an ear as vigilant as if she had been a Paganini drawing a fiddle-bow. This effect deepened as she went on, rising and rising to the great occasion, moving with extraordinary ease and in the largest, clearest style at the dizzy height of her idea. That she had an idea was visible enough, and that the whole thing was very different from all Sherringham had hitherto heard her attempt. It belonged quite to another class of effort; she was now the finished statue lifted from the <b>ground</b> to its <b>pedestal.</b> It was as if the sun of her talent had risen above the hills and she knew she was moving and would always move in its guiding light. This conviction was the one artless thing that glimmered like a young joy through the tragic mask of Constance, and Sherringham's heart beat faster as he caught it in her face. It only showed her as more intelligent, and yet there had been a time when he thought her stupid! Masterful the whole spirit in which she carried the scene, making him cry to himself from point to point, [...] "How she feels it, sees it and really 'renders' it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 37. Now, the Gothic {{builders}} {{placed their}} decoration on a precisely contrary principle, {{and on the}} only rational principle. All their best and most delicate work they put on {{the foundation of the}} building, close to the spectator, and on the upper parts of the walls they put ornaments large, bold, and capable of being plainly seen at the necessary distance. A single example will enable you to understand this method of adaptation perfectly. The lower part of the façade of the cathedral of Lyons, built either late in the thirteenth or early in the fourteenth century, is decorated with a series of niches, filled by statues of considerable size, which are supported upon pedestals within about eight feet of the <b>ground.</b> In general, <b>pedestals</b> of this kind are supported on some projecting portion of the basement; but at Lyons, owing to other arrangements of the architecture into which I have no time to enter, they are merely projecting tablets, or flat-bottomed brackets of stone, projecting from the wall. Each bracket is about {{a foot and a half}} square, and is shaped thus (fig. 13), showing to the spectator, as he walks beneath, the flat bottom of each bracket, quite in the shade, but within a couple of feet of the eye, and lighted by the reflected light from the pavement. The whole of the surface of the wall round the great entrance is covered with bas-relief, as a matter of course; but the architect appears to have been jealous of the smallest space which was well within the range of sight; and the bottom of every bracket is decorated also--nor that slightly, but decorated with no fewer than six figures each, besides a flower border, in a space, as I said, not quite a foot and a half square. The shape of the field to be decorated being a kind of quatre-foil, as shown in fig. 13, four small figures are placed, one in each foil, and two larger ones in the center. I had only time, in passing through the town, to make a drawing of one of the angles of these pedestals; that sketch I have enlarged, in order that you may have some idea of the character of the sculpture. Here is the enlargement of it (fig. 15). Now observe, this is one of the angles of the bottom of a pedestal, not two feet broad, on the outside of a Gothic building; it contains only one of the four little figures which form those angles; and it shows you the head only of one of the larger figures in the center. Yet just observe how much design, how much wonderful composition, there is in this mere fragment of a building of the great times; a fragment, literally no larger than a school-boy could strike off in wantonness with a stick: and yet I cannot tell you how much care has been spent--not so much on the execution, for it does not take much trouble to execute well on so small a scale--but on the design, of this minute fragment. You see it is composed of a branch of wild roses, which switches round at the angle, embracing the minute figure of the bishop, and terminates in a spray reaching nearly to the head of the large figure. You will observe how beautifully that figure is thus pointed to by the spray of rose, and how all the leaves around it in the same manner are subservient to the grace of its action. Look, if I hide one line, or one rosebud, how the whole is injured, and how much there is to study in the detail of it. Look at this little diamond crown, with a lock of the hair escaping from beneath it; and at the beautiful way in which the tiny leaf at a, is set in the angle to prevent its harshness; and having examined this well, consider what a treasure of thought there is in a cathedral front, a hundred feet wide, every inch of which is wrought with sculpture like this! And every front of our thirteenth century cathedrals is inwrought with sculpture of this quality! And yet you quietly allow yourselves to be told that the men who thus wrought were barbarians, and that your architects are wiser and better in covering your walls with sculpture of this kind (fig. 14, Plate VIII.) ...|$|R
