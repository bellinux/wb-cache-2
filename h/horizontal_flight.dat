5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight.</b> Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight.</b> However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight,</b> the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E

5|$|On 13 February 1961, XP831 {{performed}} {{its first}} conventional flight, flown by Bill Bedford and lasting for 22 minutes. Soon after this, XP831 was refitted {{with a new}} model of the Pegasus engine, capable of generating 12,000 lb of thrust, prior to embarking on new hovering trials in May 1961. In June, XP831 attained another milestone in the program when it performed the first transition from vertical hover to <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight,</b> initially flying the length of Dunsford's runway at a height of 50 meters.|$|E

During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight</b> and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight,</b> converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability is achieved by having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E

Elevating scrapers do not require assistance from push-tractors. The pioneer developer of the elevating scraper was Hancock Manufacturing Company of Lubbock, Texas USA. Self-propelled scrapers were invented by R. G. LeTourneau in the 1930s. His company called them Tournahoppers. This concept was further developed by LeTourneau Westinghouse Company. Most current scrapers have two axles, although historically tri-axle configurations were dominant.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the integrated digital flight control system (DFCS) is to provide rotational and translational control {{of the space shuttle}} orbiter in all phases of flight: from launch ascent through orbit to entry and touchdown, and during powered <b>horizontal</b> <b>flights.</b> The program provides a versatile control system structure while maintaining uniform communications with other programs, sensors, and control effectors by using an executive routine/functional subroutine format. The program reads all external variables at a single point, copies them into its dedicated storage, and then calls the required subroutines in the proper sequence. As a result, the flight control program is largely independent of other programs in the computer complex and is equally insensitive to characteristics of the processor configuration. The integrated structure is described of the control system and the DFCS executive routine which embodies that structure. The input and output, including jet selection are included. Specific estimation and control algorithm are shown for the various mission phases: cruise (including <b>horizontal</b> powered <b>flight),</b> entry, on-orbit, and boost.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of sonic-boom overpressures in {{water has been}} conducted by gun-launching small cone-cylinder models over water. Flights were conducted at Mach numbers of 2. 7 and 5. 7, in air, corresponding to Mach numbers of 0. 6 and 1. 3, respectively, in water. Shadowgraph pictures and underwater pressure measurements indicate that for <b>horizontal</b> <b>flights</b> at Mach numbers below Mach 4. 4 in air (i. e., subsonic relative to {{the speed of sound}} in water) the resulting underwater disturbance is an acoustic wave whose peak pressure attenuates rapidly with water depth. In contrast, at supersonic Mach numbers, relative to water, the incident shock wave at the surface is transmitted into the water as a propagating shock wave and the peak pressure associated with it does not attenuate with water depth...|$|R
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight.</b> With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
5|$|The new, larger {{aircraft}} design soon emerged, which was initially designated as P.1150/3 {{prior to being}} redesignated as the P.1154. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. This design employed a separate lift/thrust engine concept whereby eight Rolls-Royce engines would provide lift during vertical flight alongside a single turbofan for thrust during <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight.</b> The Mirage IIIV was supported by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), and also had the favour of {{several members of the}} Air Staff. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.|$|E

40|$|The "Cooperative Airborne Radiometer for Ocean and Land Studies" (CAROLS) L-Band {{radiometer}} {{was designed}} and built as {{a copy of the}} EMIRAD II radiometer constructed by the Technical University of Denmark team. It is a fully polarimetric and direct sampling correlation radiometer. It is installed on board a dedicated French ATR 42 research aircraft, in conjunction with other airborne instruments (C-Band scatterometer [...] STORM, the GOLD-RTR GPS system, the infrared CIMEL radiometer and a visible wavelength camera). Following initial laboratory qualifications, three airborne campaigns involving 21 flights were carried out over South West France, the Valencia site and the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, in coordination with in situ field campaigns. In order to validate the CAROLS data, various aircraft flight patterns and maneuvers were implemented, including straight <b>horizontal</b> <b>flights,</b> circular flights, wing and nose wags over the ocean. Analysis of the first two campaigns in 2007 and 2008 leads us to improve the CAROLS radiometer regarding isolation between channels and filter bandwidth.

25|$|The idea {{of using}} the same engine for {{vertical}} and <b>horizontal</b> <b>flight</b> by altering {{the path of the}} thrust led to the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus engine which used four rotating nozzles to direct thrust over a range of angles. This was developed side by side with an airframe, the Hawker P.1127, which became subsequently the Kestrel and then entered production as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, though the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154 was canceled in 1965. The French in competition with the P.1154 had developed a version of the Dassault Mirage III capable of attaining Mach 1.

In this paper, a new autonomous one wheel flying robot configuration has been developed that shows great promise for aiding law enforcement personnel.

40|$|This paper {{looks into}} with the {{aerodynamic}} properties {{and stability of}} the feeder airship {{in the framework of}} MAAT project. FP 7 MAAT project is based on the concept of two different types of airships (the cruiser and the feeder) working together as a transportation system. The feeder considered in this paper is a rigid airship with an unconventional envelope shape. Aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the airship during the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>flight</b> modes are of special interest in this study, because the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft directly influences its general dynamic behavior and, thus, its in-flight stability. A set of CFD simulations was conducted for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>flights</b> of the feeder airship. Drag and lift forces and pitching moment together with their coefficients, were obtained for different altitudes and velocities from the proposed operational ranges of the airship. Based on the results of CFD simulations the relations between these aerodynamic coefficients and flight parameters were established. For the dynamic modeling purposes, the feeder airship was assumed to be a rigid body. The stability analysis was carried out in frames of the obtained results. The mathematical model of the feeder airship dynamics, was developed using the classic rigid body dynamic approach and the established coefficients relationships. The authors identified the range of the angles of attack for which the airship remains statically stable. Copyright ?? 2013 SAE International...|$|R
