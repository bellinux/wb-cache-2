40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{illustrates}} a benchmarking study concerning the <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems</b> in 32 European countries as of 2011 and 2014. Particularly, this study proposes a two-dimensional approach (efficiency/effectiveness models) {{to evaluate the}} performance of national <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems.</b> Data Envelopment Analysis has been adopted to compute two performance indices, measuring efficiency and effectiveness of these <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems.</b> The {{results of the study}} emphasize that the national <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems</b> achieve different efficiency and effectiveness levels. Their performance indices are uncorrelated and behave differently over time, suggesting that there might be no real trade-off between them. The healthcare systems’ efficiencies remain generally stable, while the effectiveness values significantly improved from 2011 to 2014. However, comparing the efficiency and effectiveness scores, the authors identified a group of countries with the lowest performing <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems</b> that includes Ukraine, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Lithuania, and Romania. These countries need to implement healthcare reforms aimed at reducing resource intensity and increasing the quality of medical services. The results also showed the benefits of the proposed approach, which can help policy makers to identify shortcomings in national <b>healthcare</b> <b>systems</b> and justify the need for their reform...|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> from succumbing to adverse selection, which would result in high {{premiums}} for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E
5|$|While {{some areas}} {{improved}} during the Brezhnev era, {{the majority of}} civilian services deteriorated and living conditions for Soviet citizens fell rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying <b>healthcare</b> <b>system.</b> The living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the average Soviet person living on 13.4 square metres. Thousands of Moscow inhabitants became homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, while rationing of staple food products returned to Sverdlovsk for instance.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The National Health Service (NHS) is the {{publicly}} funded <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> in England {{responsible for providing}} the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect {{the provisions of the}} National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use, although there are charges for some people for eye tests, dental care, prescriptions and aspects of personal care.|$|E

5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and <b>healthcare</b> <b>system)</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for mental health workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the mental <b>healthcare</b> <b>system</b> based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National Mental Health Foundation. Initially skeptical about the value of Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of the National Mental Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J. Roberts, Pearl Buck and Harry Emerson Fosdick to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.|$|E
