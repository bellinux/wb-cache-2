The function of al-Jalali changed from passive defense of the harbor to a base from which troops could be dispatched. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> that followed the large central buildings and the round towers were added.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} {{believed to be}} detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the topic was dealt {{with much more}} openly than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> {{following}} federation, restrictive {{laws and}} connections to businesses have {{meant that the}} media is a largely state-owned enterprise. One of the earliest known text publications in Borneo, Hikayat Panglima Nikosa (Story of Nikosa the Warrior), was first printed in Kuching, 1876.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> {{following}} the Second World War, Salford experienced significant population decline, as residents followed employment opportunities to other locations in Greater Manchester, {{taking advantage of}} a greater choice in the type and location of housing.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> that followed, the Ministerium {{became less}} {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship would prove to be short-lived.|$|E
50|$|From 1870-1880, the {{relative}} rates of out-migration for {{whites and blacks}} were fairly similar; however, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> from 1880-1890 black out-migration slowed relative to whites in Alabama (42.3%), Mississippi (17.8%), and Tennessee (72%), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> from 1890-1900 <b>the</b> same relative decline began in Arkansas (9.3%), Georgia (45%), and Kentucky (73.9%), in total numbers (Roback 1984:1188-1189). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> of World War I both groups were leaving the South, with whites leaving at a slightly higher rate; but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade</b> of World War II, the South lost 1.58 million blacks, and only 866,000 whites (Wright 1987:174).|$|R
50|$|Colorado {{made just}} one more bowl {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade,</b> <b>in</b> 2007, which they also lost. They have not won a bowl game since 2004. Clemson went to four more bowl games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Welsh border {{situation}} remained unsettled however, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> after 1250 security grew significantly worse, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd conducted numerous raids into English territories.

5|$|The {{city was}} {{extensively}} redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included {{the construction of}} large tower block estates, such as Castle Vale. The Bull Ring was reconstructed and New Street station was redeveloped. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> following World War II, the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly, as it received waves of immigration from the Commonwealth of Nations and beyond. The city's population peaked in 1951 at 1,113,000 residents.|$|E

5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E

5|$|After {{experiencing}} fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> {{immediately after}} the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a faster rate than most northern states.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the States Reorganisation Act (1956), Mangalore (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was {{incorporated}} into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State (now called Karnataka). Mangalore is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of population, and eighth largest port of India, providing Karnataka with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. Mangalore experienced significant growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> 1970â€“80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector, particularly in medical services, a small but growing IT regional hub, and a booming real estate and banking industry.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
50|$|No firm {{data on the}} play's date of authorship has survived. Scholars have conjectured a date of authorship {{sometime}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>decade</b> of <b>the</b> 17th century â€” either early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade,</b> {{based on}} allusions to contemporary events like the Siege of Ostend (1601-04), or later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decade,</b> based on perceived links with literary works like King Lear and The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested that far fewer would have died, both then and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> that followed, if the Reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration had applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further workâ€”both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E
