Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses, and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election, [...] "I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office.

Alison Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the group, said of the move, [...] "It may look like Arsenal are doing great things for the area, but in its detail the plan <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> We blame the council; the football club just wants to expand to make more money." [...] Tom Lamb, an ISCA member, was concerned about as air pollution and growing traffic, adding [...] "that is a consequence which most Arsenal fans would never see, because they are in Islington only for about thirty days a year." ...|$|E

Wilson commented to Agence France-Presse: [...] "Uwe Boll is the world-class movie director – anything he does <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> He was the overwhelming choice to receive our career achievement award." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Tucker Smallwood {{recalled}} that the filming was an unpleasant experience. He entered {{production of the}} episode with little knowledge {{of the nature of}} The X-Files, and was surprised when he received the screenplay. During his first day on set, he asked other cast members if the series was always so violent. An unidentified crew member said, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> even for us", and commented that it was probably the most gruesome episode of the series run. During the sheriff's death scene Smallwood insisted on performing his own stunts, until he hit [...] his head attempting a dive. Another uncomfortable moment for the actor involved lying face down in a pool of fake blood for more than 90 minutes.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt of {{the website}} Den of Geek said that [...] "This {{is one of}} those episodes which exemplify all that <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> about Star Trek in general. I'm not talking about season one's dubious {{production}} values (which, to be fair, are considerably more even than they were when the series began) but about the episode's very fabric." [...] Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation thought that the episode could have been better if the guest cast was up to a better quality. However, she felt that the episode fell foul of several TNG season one writing errors, such as Deanna Troi's statements breaking any mounting tension and the crew failing to do such quite simple steps such as separating feuding aliens and William Riker being held hostage {{for the second time in}} successive episodes.|$|E

500|$|... "Britney/Brittany" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "D+", commenting {{that it was}} [...] "what people who say Glee <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> are talking about when they say Glee is awful." [...] He criticized the lack of plot and coherence in the musical numbers, feeling that storyline and character arcs were ignored in favor of showcasing Spears covers. Stack described the episode as a [...] "monumental television event,"; however, he also expressed his lingering sense of [...] "slight disappointment." [...] While he enjoyed the episode overall, Stack wrote that Spears' songs felt forced into the storyline, and that the episode was neither as iconic nor as exhilarating as Glee Madonna tribute. The Parents Television Council slammed the episode, accusing the presentation of Spears as a [...] "symbol of empowerment and self-esteem" [...] problematic, observing that the young audience [...] "basically witnessed an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque." ...|$|E
500|$|Lego Racers {{gameplay}} {{received a}} mixed reaction from critics. Charla called creating and testing cars {{a lot of}} fun, especially because the way a car is built has [...] "a major effect on how it controls", and IGN's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive. However, Stahl called the game's construction system unfriendly, stating that the player is [...] "better off just sticking {{with one of the}} default vehicles". Imperio said that handling the cars is [...] "surprisingly tight", calling the N64 control scheme intuitive. Conversely, Charla found that most of the cars feel top-heavy, and stated that the racing <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> IGN's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system, calling it pretty cool, as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add [...] "a new strategy to the game", but Stahl called the system [...] "terribly lame". Reviewers also criticised the game's multiplayer features, with IGN's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple, and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the [...] "lack of multiplayer options" [...] hurts Lego Racers replay value.|$|E
500|$|Radio Times {{reviewer}} Patrick Mulkern {{likened the}} character to Brigitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen) in the Danish series Borgen, {{explaining that the}} two [...] "form a very small club of politicians in TV drama who are hugely sympathetic, female and enjoy a rapid rise to PM". Mulkern felt that Wilton was [...] "a major saving grace" [...] in the [...] "disappointing" [...] "Aliens of London" [...] / [...] "World War Three". The Daily Telegraphs Hugh Davies commented {{on a number of}} political allusions made through Jones's characterisation as Prime Minister in [...] "The Christmas Invasion". He felt that her rebuttal of aid from the US president after aliens invade is a [...] "swipe at Blair and Bush over the invasion of Iraq". He also compared Jones's destruction of the fleeing Sycorax—a decision heavily criticised by the Doctor—to Margaret Thatcher's decision to sink the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. Russell T Davies responded to observations of political commentary by stating that there is [...] "absolutely an anti-war message" [...] present in the episode due to Christmas being [...] "a day of peace". In their unauthorised guide to Doctor Who, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith felt that Wilton delivered the [...] "standout performance" [...] of the Christmas special" [...] stating that, whilst the character remained recognisable, it was [...] "fascinating watching her harder edge emerge from the woman we know and love". Of Harriet Jones's development, Stuart Galbrainth of DVD Talk felt that she begins as a [...] "charming neophyte minister" [...] but becomes [...] "suddenly much less charming at the end of [...] "Christmas Invasion," [...] when she becomes just another politician". However, Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek felt that the episode's denouement was flawed by trying to [...] "make out that Harriet Jones <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> for doing something perfectly reasonable." [...] Similarly, io9's Chris Cummins commented that the character had [...] "noble intentions" [...] and that she was proved right upon her return in the fourth series.|$|E

[...] Reviewer Chris Adams stated [...] "Everything <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> From sprites to backgrounds to effects, it shames the Marvel license.".

2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless." [...] It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Anderson felt {{pleased with}} {{three-quarters of the}} album, with the {{remaining}} quarter [...] "not quite jelling", but felt the too soon release deadline given to the band resulted in a lack of time to listen and alter the music properly. Squire recalled the album's period as not a happy one, and deemed the album [...] "a difficult one". He commented on Anderson's attitude then: [...] "Jon had this visionary idea that you could just walk into a studio, and if the vibes were right ... the music would be great {{at the end of}} the day ... It isn't reality". Wakeman continues to hold a critical view. In 2006, he clarified that his total dislike of the album is [...] "not entirely true" [...] and thinks there are some [...] "very nice musical moments in Topographic Oceans, but because of the format of how records used to be we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding <b>is</b> <b>awful</b> ... but there are some beautiful solos like [...] "Nous sommes du soleil" ... one of the most beautiful melodies ... and deserved to be developed even more perhaps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis); regular Seasons 1–3, {{guest star}} Season 5: A {{creative}} copywriter and Princeton University alumnus, the bearded, pipe-smoking Paul {{prides himself on}} his politically liberal views. Some time before the series began he {{had a relationship with}} Joan Holloway which ended badly, largely because Paul talked about it too much. Paul tried, unsuccessfully, to date Peggy soon after she was hired by Sterling Cooper. Through most of the second season, Paul dated Sheila White, an African-American woman from South Orange, New Jersey. They break up while in Oxford, Mississippi, where they had gone as Freedom Riders to oppose segregation in the South. It is a source of pride for Kinsey to live in the low-income, southern section of Montclair, New Jersey; Joan, however, mocks him as a shallow poseur. He is highly competitive, an attribute revealed to have soured a few friendships while he was in college, and which causes friction with Peggy, who quickly proves to be a superior copywriter to him. [...] He is furious upon discovering that Don chose Peggy for the new agency over him. Paul did not appear after the third season finale until he reappeared in the tenth episode of Season 5, revealing himself to Harry as a disciple of Krishna Consciousness. Paul asks Harry to look at a Star Trek script he wrote, which Harry thinks <b>is</b> <b>awful.</b> Harry later realizes that Paul's girlfriend is manipulating him because of his recruiting skills within the Krishna movement, and encourages Paul to follow his dreams. He gives Paul $500 and tells him to get to Los Angeles as soon as possible.|$|E
