40|$|ABSTRACT: Factors {{influencing}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> {{of transmission}} pipeline steels {{are described in}} the paper. Ratios of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> are presented, determined {{on the basis of}} metallographic examination, as well as the new <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> ratio determined {{on the basis of a}} static tensile test. A model allowing for an assessment of specimens behaviour with hydrogen induced cracks has been proposed. This model allows to determine the relations between the HIC ratios proposed by NACE TMO 284 - 96 Standard (metallographic examinations) and the new HIC ratio proposed by authors which expresses the decrease of the plastic properties (contraction) of hydrogenated specimens in relation to non-hydrogenated specimens (strength tests).

Baseline HIC and SOHIC {{tests were conducted}} in NACE TM 0284 - 96 solution A. For the SOHIC tests, four-point double beam specimens were stressed to 60 %, 80 % or 100 % of the yield strength of the steel in order to study the effect of applied stress. Test conditions included solutions containing 70 wt. % DGA and 500 ppm H 2 S to 0. 45 or higher mole-H 2 S/mole-DGA and temperatures of 25, 45 and 80 C. Corrosion rates of the steel were calculated from weight loss of the HIC specimens in order to compare {{the severity of the}} test environment with the actual service environment. Cracks were characterized in terms of crack length ratio (CLR), crack thickness ratio (CTR) and crack sensitivity ratio (CSR). Results indicate that conventional ASTM A 516 - 70 pressure vessel steel is not susceptible to HIC or SOHIC in various H 2 S-containing DGA solutions at the temperatures studied.

40|$|The {{detection}} {{and location of}} hydrogen induced cracks In steel pipes is unreliable and time consuming because of the unpredictable nature of the defect {{and the lack of}} sensitivity of conventional non destructive testing techniques. Determination of the susceptibility of steels to the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> by attack from a sour gas environment has always been based on laboratory testing of small samples where the samples are subjected to attack from all sides. This is unrealistic compared to the in-service situation and a single sided exposure test is more realistic. In this thesis the subject literature is reviewed. Experiments on small samples show that seamless steel is the least susceptible to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking,</b> whereas electric welded un directionally formed pipe is the most susceptible. The susceptibility of submerged arc welded pipe depends on the metallurgical form of the pipe but is always less susceptible than the electric welded pipe. Ultrasonic techniques have been used to detect the location of hydrogen induced cracks but manual techniques are labour intensive and unreliable. Four complete pipes were subjected to a sour gas environment from one side, one of which was seamless and one electric welded. These pipes were monitored using a passive non destructive testing technique, acoustic emission. A mechanised ultrasonic scanner was used to examine the last two pipes found to be susceptible to cracking using a specially selected ultrasonic transducer. The acoustic emission data collected was used to detect and locate areas of high acoustic activity produced by the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>Induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> These areas were examined metallographically and shown to include several forms of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking.</b> The mechanised ultrasonic technique failed to detect near surface (< 1 mm) cracks, but was able to resolve mid wall affected areas.

40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> cold <b>cracking</b> in weldments is {{the most}} serious problem {{limiting}} the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of cold cracking in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> cold <b>cracking</b> in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> cold <b>cracking</b> in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which <b>induces</b> stresses, cold <b>cracking</b> in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> cold <b>cracking.</b> The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 Â°C, 40 Â°C, 60 Â°C, 80 Â°C and 100 Â°C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 Â°C, confirming that the weld metal transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 Â°C, but a preheat of 100 Â°C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of various zinc-containing topcoats on hydrogen re-embrittlement. In order to cause <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking,</b> hydrogen does not only need to be formed, but also needs to penetrate and migrate into the material. The hydrogen entry is influenced by various parameters, e. g. temperature, electrostatic potential, humidity, pH-value, oxygen concentration, chloride and promoter concentration, and time. In this study, the influence of different environmental conditions on the hydrogen induced corrosion was investigated by means of electrochemical permeation measurements. The electrochemical permeation measurements were performed under different concentrations of the local oxygen content (5 % NaCl; pH = 3; flushing with different gases). For these chosen environmental conditions, the results show that the local oxygen content has a significant influence on the resulting permeation current. To validate the results of the electrochemical permeation measurements and to examine the susceptibility against hydrogen re-embrittlement of those zinc containing topcoats, incremental step-load-tests were performed under the same environmental conditions. It is shown that the investigated topcoats (electroplated zinc, electroplated zinc-nickel, galvanized zinc, zinc-flake (GEOMET 321 A)) impose a different susceptibility on hydrogen re-embrittlement.

No secondary cracking was observed for samples tested in air. Qualitative examinations of specimen surfaces in SEM suggested that crack initiation happens preferentially at grain boundaries (GBs) and twins. This was supported by EBSD results indicating higher dislocation density at GBs and twins. Crack propagation happened transgranularly, as evidenced by the fracture surfaces. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> localized plasticity (HELP) is assumed to be the dominating mechanism for HISC, as suggested by significantly deformed regions near the crack edge and surrounding the crack tip. Particle content did not appear to affect crack initiation. A method for using digital image correlation technology to map local strains from in situ tensile testing was developed, although more work is necessary to refine the method and setup...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} soil type of Shanghai and {{electrode}} potential from cathodic protection point on near-neutral pH {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) behavior of pipeline steel X 60 has been investigated for structural integrity assessment. The SCC behavior was evaluated through slow strain rate tests (SSRT) at various electrode potentials in three solutions containing different typical soils. Results showed that the SCC susceptibility generally increased with decreasing electrode potential in all the three environments, with quick increase happening in the range from- 1500 to- 700 mV(SCE). It is suggested that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> should dominate the SCC at low potentials. In cathodic potential range, the rank of the SCC susceptibility for soil type was Near-city soil> Cyan-purple soil> Cyan-yellow soil. In anodic potential range, SCC susceptibility curves mixed {{each other in the}} three solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear waste}} package design for Yucca Mountain (Nevada, USA), {{in its current}} configuration, {{consists}} of a double wall cylindrical container fabricated using a highly corrosion resistant Ni-based Alloy 22 for the outer barrier and type 316 stainless steel for the inner structural vessel. A mailbox-shaped drip shield fabricated primarily using Ti Grade 7 will cover the waste packages. The environmental degradation of the relevant materials have been extensively studied and modeled for over ten years. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art understanding of the degradation modes of Alloy 22 (N 06022) due to its interaction with the predicted in-drift mountain conditions including temperature and types of electrolytes. Subjects discussed include thermal aging and phase stability, dry oxidation, general and localized corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking...</b>|$|E
40|$|Welds {{of thick}} plates (304 SS) clad with Ti of {{commercial}} purity in as-received state and also after subsequent heat treatment and/or after hydrogen charging were investigated. Fatigue tests {{were carried out}} at amplitude of 20 Hz and in case of bimetal without hydrogen charging also at amplitude of 40 Hz. After heat treatment, charged welds showed higher threshold level than the welds without heat treatment. Energy dispersed analyses (EDA) of fracture surfaces showed that failure predominantly occurred in joint. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> <b>cracking</b> (HIC) response of bimetal samples demonstrated favourable results both after welding and after subsequent heat treatment. Short and thin cracks were observed, exclusively located in mixed zone, where approx. 16 - 20 at. % of Ti using EDX (energy dispersed analyser) was revealed. By application of monochromatic synchrotron radiation Ti-, Fe-fcc, Fe-bcc and intermetallic phase Fe 2 Ti were detected. Web of Science 5941610160...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is the evaluation of {{a proposal for a}} gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test, used for study of hydrogen cracks in relatively thin sheets of welded steel. That new proposal consists of the replacement of the usual solid blocks by an assembly of blocks {{in such a way that}} the test can evaluate weld beads on thin sheets. Student t distribution is applied to examine the functionality of the proposed test. Weld metals were deposited with flux-cored wires E 71 T- 1 and E 71 T 8 -K 6, with diameters of 1. 6 and 1. 7 mm, respectively, under two different preheating temperatures. Metal susceptibility to hydrogen cracking was evaluated by the presence and percentage of cracks in the weld metal. In order to evaluate and verify the functionality of the new G-BOP test proposal, the following were examined: efficiency of the new test in <b>inducing</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>cracks</b> in the weld metal, result replicability, fracture modes present in cracks, and the cooling rate imposed on the welding zone. Results showed that the new G-BOP test proposal is viable; results were replicable and the test was efficient in <b>inducing</b> <b>cracks</b> in weld metal with a confidence of 90 %.

40|$|Nickel base alloys 600 and 690 {{have found}} {{widespread}} applications in nuclear reactor steam generators. In particular, alloy 690 {{with a major}} element composition of typically Ni- 30 Cr- 9 Fe, has shown an apparent improvement in performance when compared with alloy 600 in both primary water and caustic environments. Nevertheless, alloy 690 can also be susceptible of undergoing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> stress corrosion <b>cracking</b> (SCC). However, {{the role of the}} microstructural state is not well defined, such as the effect of {{the presence or absence of}} carbide precipitation along grain boundaries on the overall susceptibility. In this work, self-loaded linear elastic fracture mechanics M-WOL specimens made of alloy 690 were tested in both, the solution annealed condition (minimal grain boundary carbide precipitation), and after a grain boundary carbide precipitation treatment. Tests were carried out at 320 - 400 degrees C in an instrumented autoclave used to 2 Ì† 7 in-situ 2 Ì† 7 monitor crack growth rates. The environment was simulated by the generation of high-pressure supersaturated hydrogen steam. The tested M-WOL specimens were loaded under various applied KI values (between 50 - 80 MPa m 1 / 2).

40|$|Hydrogen {{damage is}} a {{technological}} problem that limits {{the useful life}} of the components. Traditionally the influence of hydrogen has been evaluated by tensile test and dead weight loading of electrolytically charged specimens. Hydrogen affects the yield, UTS and ductility. It is also now being realised that rather than emphasing the loss in tensile ductility alone, the whole stress-strain curve should be analysed as in the slow strain rate testing. However, since last three decades fracture mechanics is being increasingly used to assess fitness with a known size of defect. The local elastic stress at crack tip is related to stress intensity factory (K). Whenever the fracture problem involves large scale plasticity, other cracking parameters like crack tip opening displacement may be used. Hydrogen embrittlement is commonly thought to occur by subscritical crack growth often producing time delayed fractures. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>induced</b> subcritical <b>crack</b> growth at different stress intensity range (Delta K) is measured using LEFM. The influence of hydrogen on fatigue crack growth rate has not received sufficient attention. It is commonly assumed not detrimental in high cycle fatigue {{due to the fact}} that sufficient time is not available for the hydrogen to accumulte at the crack tip and cause damage. This paper outlines the fracture mechanics approach and presents research results carried out in the Department to study the phenomena of hydrogen embrittlement. The results have unambiguously demonstrated that: COD is a more sensitive parameter to measure fracture initiation toughness and that hydrogen plays a damaging role even at 10 Hz as there is a monotonic non zero tensile stress at crack tip. The correlation of observed trend in COD and FCG rate with fractography has indicated the mechanism by which hydrogen promotes cleavage fracture...|$|R
