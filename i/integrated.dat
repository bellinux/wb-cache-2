Tight coordination among business partners assists to share and <b>integrate</b> the service logic globally. But <b>integrating</b> service logics across diverse enterprises leads to exponential problem which stipulates developers to comprehend the whole service and must resolve suitable method to <b>integrate</b> the services. It is complex and time-consuming task. So the present focus is to have a mechanized system to analyze the Business logics and convey the proper mode to <b>integrate</b> them. There is no standard model to undertake these issues and one such a framework proposed in this paper examines the Business logics individually and suggests proper structure to <b>integrate</b> them. One of the innovative concepts of proposed model is Property Evaluation System which scrutinizes the service logics and generates Business Logic Property Schema (BLPS) for the required services. BLPS holds necessary information to recognize the correct structure for <b>integrating</b> the service logics. At the time of integration, System consumes this BLPS schema and suggests the feasible ways to <b>integrate</b> the service logics. Also if the service logics are attempted to <b>integrate</b> in invalid structure or attempted to violate accessibility levels, system will throw exception with necessary information. This helps developers to ascertain the efficient structure to <b>integrate</b> the services with least effort. Comment: 16 page...|$|R
