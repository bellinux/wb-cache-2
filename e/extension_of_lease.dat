40|$|In {{the complex}} interplay of {{segmented}} office markets and short- and long-term developments, a drama {{is taking place}} at an intermediate time scale: office buildings are becoming obsolete before their time. Since the mid- 1980 s, the problems arising from premature obsolescence, diminishing returns, higher costs, and increasing vacancies have drawn attention in the Netherlands. Premature obsolescence {{is the result of}} developments on the demand and supply side of the office market but also of the changing structure of cities. This study revolves around the owners experiences with the obsolescence of their office buildings in Amsterdam and Rotterdam and the strategies they use to cope with the problems associated with obsolescence. The owners of obsolete office buildings have a whole range of strategies to choose from, which may be grouped under two headings: property development (refurbishment and redevelopment, intended for either re-use as offices or as accommodation for other functions); and other forms of management (entailing little or no upgrading, intended for either maintenance or sale). The conditions for investment in renewal were not favourable during {{a large part of the}} research period. Yet for the majority of owners, the alternative strategies <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> without refurbishment, sale, change of function were even less attractive. The financial constraints played a key role in the decision-making. The limited financial scope for investment in renewal was not only the result of the realistic market rents for office space and for other uses; it was also a result of the financial obstacles introduced by the long-term owners themselves. This behaviour may be traced back to the use of old-fashioned methods of bookkeeping and valuation. Over the past few years, real growth in rents has created more financial leeway for that kind of investment. In the same period the owners who are active on the real estate investment market have become more professional. External benchmarks have forced them to act with greater transparency, show more market-responsiveness, and be more realistic in their bookkeeping. Thus, one may expect to see fewer constraints on investment in or sale of obsolete office buildings. A more 'normal' market of obsolete buildings will come into play, whereby possibilities and challenges will arise for different kinds of actors. The economic obsolescence of office premises will be a manageable problem for owners only if the locational obsolescence of the sites can be prevented. These locational problems cannot be solved by the owners of the premises alone. A regionally co-ordinated policy of local governments will be needed to upgrade the quality and capacity of existing office locations before releasing an ample supply of greenfields for office development. As long as existing office locations retain their appeal to office firms, the rent level can be kept up through a 'locational premium' effect. This creates additional financial possibilities for investment in renewal of the building...|$|E
40|$|Målet med denne oppgaven har vært å belyse mulige konsekvenser tomtefestelovens nye § 33 kommer til å ha. Dette belyses ved hjelp av ulike case og drøftelse. Tomtefesteloven § 33 omhandler forlengelse, dette er en mulighet som gis ved festetidens utløp. Her har den Europeiske Menneskerettighetsdomstolen(EMD) kommet frem til at § 33 i tomtefesteloven strider mot Den europeiske menneskerettighetskonvensjon første tilleggsprotokoll artikkel 1 om vern av eiendomsretten. I mitt arbeid har jeg benyttet meg av en kvalitativ metode der jeg har intervjuet {{relevante}} personer og analysert forskjellige dokumenter. Forlengelse av feste bestemmes av en midlertidig lov nå, denne vil bli erstattet med nye regler. De nye reglene vil primært få konsekvenser for fester. Det er også dette jeg har ønsket å finne ut av. Problemstillingen min lyder som følger: På hvilken måte vil modellene i NOU 2013 nr. 11 påvirke forskjellige typer festekontrakter for bolig- og fritidseiendom? Målet med disse modellene er å skape det EMD kaller «fair balance». Dette betyr at man skal få et mer balansert lovverk som tar vare på bortfesters, så vel som festers interesser ved forlengelse. Etter arbeidet har jeg funnet at det er vanskelig å skulle bestemme hva som er riktig løsning på problemet. Jeg har prøvd å belyse mulige konsekvenser ved de ulike modellene som er foreslått. Og det er mange tanker og utfordringer som reiser seg. Man kan si det er fordeler og ulemper med alle de foreslåtte modellene. Den store utfordringen har vært å finne det «fair balance», dette på grunn av at EMD ikke presiserte hvor denne balansen ligger. This thesis aims {{to provide}} insight to possible consequences and implications the new § 33 in the Ground Lease Act will have. This {{will be done}} {{using a variety of}} cases and discussion. § 33 in the Ground Lease Act addresses <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>lease</b> contracts, this can be used at the expiry of the contract. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has concluded that § 33 of the Ground Lease act is in violation with Article 1 of Protocol No 1 (protection of property) of the European Convention on Human Rights. I have used at qualitative method in my work; this includes interviews with relevant persons and also analysis different documents. If one would want to extend their leasehold before the new paragraph is in place, there is a temporary law on this. This will be replaces with the new one. This paragraph primarily affects the lessees. The effect this will have is my focus. I have approached the problem like this: How will the models presented in NOU 2013 nr. 11 affect different kinds of leasehold contracts in both residential and recreational properties? The goal for these models is to create what ECHR calls “fair balance”. This means that the new paragraph should balance the interests of both the lessors and the lessees. I have found {{that it is difficult to}} clearly determine the correct solution. I have tried to elucidate the possible consequences of the various models proposed. There are many thoughts and challenges that arise. One can sat there are pros and cons to all the proposed models. The major challenge has been to find what the ECHR calls “fair balance”, this I due to the fact that ECHR did not specify where this balance lies...|$|E
