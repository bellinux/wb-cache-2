Beilin and Mounsey (1962) described in great detail {{the changes in the}} apical impulse occurring in a series of 25 hypertensive patients who had been brought into hospital with a view to treatment with hypotensive drugs. They showed that with the development of hypertensive cardiac disease, as demonstrated by the electrocardiogram and x-ray, there was an ab-normal prolongation of the apical impulse up to, or beyond, the second heart sound. They also stated that patients with borderline hypertrophy showed inconstant changes in the apical impulse while those without hypertrophy (as shown on the electrocardio-gram and chest x-ray) had an entirely normal impulse. The present paper is an extension of this work to determine the value of the apical impulse in deter-mining changes in left ventricular function at an earlier stage than indicated either by the <b>electro-cardiogram</b> or chest x-ray.

To {{determine}} whether chil-dren with pallid breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia {{can be treated}} safely and successfully with permanent pacemaker implantation. Methods. The records of pediatric patients who had apparent breath-holding spells and associated bradycar-dia and were treated with permanent pacemaker implan-tation were reviewed. Results. Ten pediatric patients with apparent breath-holding spells associated with bradycardia were treated with a permanent ventricular demand pacemaker at the Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1995. Patients had onset of symptoms between ages 6 days and 12 months and pre-sented for evaluation between ages 12 months and 5 years. Duration of spells was 15 seconds to 10 minutes. Medications to prevent spells were unsuccessful. <b>Electro-cardiograms</b> documented asystolic pauses of 1. 7 to 24 seconds (mean: 11. 9 seconds). Permanent ventricular de-mand pacemakers were implanted at 10 months to 5 years of age (median: 14. 5 months) : 9 endocardial and 1 epicar-dial. Three patients required pacemaker revision.

40|$|In the {{intensive}} Care Unit {{there is a}} striking difference between {{the state of the}} art of haemodynamic monitoring and that of pulmonary function monitoring. The haemodynamic status of Intensive Care patients is continuously monitored by devices producing signals of beat-to-beat <b>electro-cardiograms</b> and blood pressures, using sophisticated, fully developed devices, that can be delivered from stock and handled with ease by people without special technical background. The resulting signals are available in real-time) and the interpretation of the signal is based on physiologic models. On the other hand, pulmonary monitoring is usually limited to a few blood gas measurements per day, occasional chest X-ray and occasional inspection of airway pressures. These simple data are not sufficient to describe properties of the lung and the gas transport, and indicate deterioration of the lung function only at a very late stage, when the chances for complications have already been increased. It also means that in mechanically ventilated patients the clinician takes the control of the ventilation over from the patient without having direct information on the gas exchange process in the lung. Instead the clinician has to rely on secondary information like blood gas pressure. In most cases these techniques give adequate information. However, e. g. in patients suffering the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome the clinician tries to maintain the lung volume at a desired level by application of a positive airway pressure (PEEP, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure), but is not able to measure the lung volume that he wants to control.

Key-words: Data mining, time series, classification, statistical features 1 Introduction Data mining is the process of pattern identification in large databases [1]. The main objectives of data mining are prediction and description. Data mining methods belong to several categories. Regression maps data to prediction values. Generalization produces a simple description from complex data and association finds dependencies among data. Clustering identifies a set of types with which data can be categorized, whereas classification maps data to a set of a predefined types. Data mining has been mainly applied to relational data. Non-relational data present important challenges to data mining due to their size and dimensionality. Time-series data are supported by many database systems. A time series is a sequence of real numbers representing the values of a variable over time. They have found applications in temporal [2] and scientific databases, as well as in data warehouses containing a variety of data types, from stock market prices to <b>electro-cardiograms.</b> Mining time-series data can reveal important patterns, such as similarities [3], trends [4] or periodicity [5].

The {{effect of the}} concentration of halothane, the blood pressure, the arterial blood gases and sensory stimulation on the occurrence of the ventricular extra-systoles with contradirectional interference are described. It is suggested that, under certain conditions, halothane may produce cardiac arrythmias in cats through a direct action on the myocardium. Muir, Hall and Iittlewort (1959) reported cardiac arrhythmia in fourteen of sixteen cats anaes-thetized with 1. 5 - 3. 0 per cent halothane. <b>Electro-cardiograms</b> from the cats showed that the arrhythmia consisted of ventricular extrasystoles with a phasic variation in the amplitude of the R waves, indicating the presence of "interference dissociation". The arrhythmia disappeared rapidly on increasing the concentration of halothane in the inspired gases, but reappeared about 5 min-utes later. A decrease in the inspired concentra-tion of halothane had no immediate effect on the arrhythmia. Overventilation with an accompany-ing reduction in plasma bicarbonate also caused the arrhythmia to disappear.

40|$|S INCE 1906, when Cremer (1) first re-ported {{use of an}} intra-esophageal elec-trocardiographic electrode, such {{electrodes}} {{have been}} intermittently employed {{for the study of}} cardiac mechanisms. Because the esophagus is anatomically located close by the left atrium, a properly placed esophag-eal electrode is virtually a semidirect lead to the left atrium and electrocardiograms recorded from this position have very large P-waves. The P-waves are frequently small and difficult to identify in routine <b>electro-cardiograms</b> recorded from body-surface electrodes, especially in complex cardiac mechanisms. In recent years, the unipolar esophageal lead has been used more fre-quently in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhyth-mias with encouraging results (2 - 6). A simple unipolar salt-bridge esophageal electrode was devised in our laboratory some years ago, and tracings recorded with this technique were marked by minimal erratic base line behavior (7). A bipolar salt-bridge esophageal electrode was then designed and constructed and has been used clinically at this institution for more than 5 years. In addition to exceptional base line stability, the bipolar salt-bridge esophageal lead possesses other unique properties. When properly positioned in the esophagus, this lead enlarges the P-waves while simultaneously cancelling the QRS complexes; this greatly increases the ratio of the amplitude of P-waves to the amplitude of the QRS complexes and thus results in electrocardiograms characterized by maximum P-wave visibility. Further-more, the bipolar electrode is very sensitive to small changes in the direction of atrial depolarization and thus facilitates recogni-tion of ectopic atrial depolarization. Principles of esophageal electrocardiog-raphy and the results of clinical evaluation of the bipolar salt-bridge esophageal lead have been published previously (8, 9). The bipolar esophageal lead has been applied to the study of complex cardiac mechanisms (10, 11). It is the purpose of this presenta-tion to further illustrate the technical ex-cellence of electrocardiograms recorded by this technique and especially to emphasize the practical clinical application of eso-phageal electrocardiography...|$|R
40|$|Lancet 1 {{on the new}} {{atherosclerotic}} {{cardiovascular disease}} (ASCVD) risk equation released by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association. 2 They showed that the new risk equa-tion overestimates ASCVD risk when applied in several cohort studies. One of these studies was the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, 3 which {{was used in the}} American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to validate the ASCVD risk equation. As REGARDS investigators, we are writing to provide clarification on design com-ponents of REGARDS and other contemporary cardiovascular epi-demiology studies cited by Ridker and Cook that could contribute to lower-than-expected event numbers. We offer 4 possible explanations for the apparent overestimation of ASCVD risk by the new equation. In our opinion, these explanations suggest that the ASCVD risk equa-tion may be more valid than has been suggested by Ridker and Cook. First, the studies used to develop the ASCVD risk equation included “active surveillance ” to supplement self-report for identifying possi-ble events. For example, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (1 of the studies used in developing the ASCVD risk equation), investigators identified possible ASCVD events using 2 approaches: (1) study staff telephoned participants or their proxies annually to identify hospitalizations and deaths; and (2) they searched lists of International Classification of Diseases codes from area hos-pitals and state death files. 4 For all death and hospital records that may have involved an ASCVD event, the ARIC study staff abstracted diagnostic information and obtained Minnesota coding for <b>electro-cardiograms.</b> Also, coronary events that occurred out of the hospital setting were documented by study staff who contacted physicians, coroners, and next of kin for information. However, the validation cohorts (REGARDS and the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA]) and, to our knowledge, the studies evaluated by Ridker and Cook did not include similar surveillance procedures, which are costly and far less feasible since the implementation of the Healt...|$|R
