25|$|On July 16, 2005, The Washington Post {{reported}} that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, {{which could have}} extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated. The Post also suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> Miller's version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before {{a federal grand jury}} the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.|$|E
25|$|The main {{trial of}} the ringleaders of the {{rebellion}} (the 19 surviving officers, Isobe, Muranaka and two other civilians) began on April 28. The trial was held in secret, and the defendants did not have rights to legal representation, call witnesses or appeal. The judges were not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> about the defendants' motives and intentions and forced them to concentrate on their actions in their testimony. The trial was therefore far different from the ordinary court martial that Aizawa had faced a few months earlier. Charged with , the rebel officers argued that their actions had {{been approved by the}} Minister of War's Proclamation and their incorporation into the martial law forces, and that they had never been formally presented with the imperial command. The verdicts were handed down on June 4 and the sentences on July 5: all were found guilty and 17 were sentenced to death.|$|E

In interview, Norman cited the limited repertoire, noting that fans of the band were only <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> hits like [...] "Yakety Yak", [...] "Charlie Brown" [...] and [...] "Poison Ivy"; [...] "In 30 years we did maybe 10 songs." [...] Norman did have opportunity to deviate with other love songs from the 1950s, the era when The Coaster's rose to fame.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics such as Jeriaska of RPGFan, who enjoyed the arrangements, {{particularly those of}} pieces from games early in the Final Fantasy series. He praised Joe Down Studios for not falling {{into the trap of}} [...] "introducing a veneer of self-importance" [...] that he felt was common in remakes of early Final Fantasy pieces. Chris of Square Enix Music Online also liked the album, saying that the arrangements [...] "make many tracks sound better than they've ever sounded before". His largest complaint about the album was that it does not include every track from the game, some of which he was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing.</b> He ascribed the exclusions to the publisher's desire to release the soundtrack as a single disc, and concluded that the album was still a [...] "very enjoyable overall experience".|$|E
500|$|The mixtape {{received}} general acclaim among music critics, despite {{not being}} an official release. In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau {{said he was}} more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> M.I.A.'s own original music than a mashup: [...] "I find more fascination—and pleasure, if not variety—in M.I.A. juxtaposed against herself than in, for instance, favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'. Which isn't to deny I also find all these good things in favela funk juxtaposed against 'Walk Like an Egyptian'." [...] Rollie Pemberton from Stylus Magazine called Piracy Funds Terrorism [...] "a genre-bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats" [...] and said that, based {{on the strength of}} the mixtape, M.I.A.'s first official album had a lot to live up to. Village Voice critic Tom Breihan later expressed relief that M.I.A.'s aesthetic and her debut album did not have much input from Diplo.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E

Gross praised the video quality, but criticized the DVD functionality and features. He also wrote that [...] "even in the heavier parts of this conversation, there's a warmth and comradery there that's rife with good humor". Scott Brown of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an F, saying that the only people likely to watch the film other than extreme Star Trek fans are people <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> the sound alleged to be Shatner's flatulence, which Brown said can be clearly heard. He called the film [...] "seemingly interminable" [...] and said the discussion between Shatner and Nimoy shows that they [...] "rival black holes in sheer self-absorption". According to John Henzell, writing for The Press of New Zealand, Mind Melds trailer took its subject matter so seriously that it became comical.|$|E
500|$|Peter's devout Catholic father, Francis, visits Quahog. Upon arrival, {{he insists}} that Stewie be baptized as a Catholic. After visiting a church with Peter and Stewie, Francis is {{informed}} that the holy water is tainted and {{he will have to}} wait. Francis is in disbelief, and baptizes Stewie himself. Stewie soon becomes unwell and is informed that he must be quarantined and kept in a germ-free environment by a doctor for the time being until his immune system's strength recovers {{at the end of the}} episode. Then Lois discovers that Francis coaxed Peter into having Stewie baptized without her knowledge, and tells Peter to choose his own religious beliefs and not allow himself to be a slave to his father's religion. Peter initially converts to Mormonism, but then discovers that Mormons cannot drink alcohol; he then tries Jehovah's Witnesses and attempts door-to-door preaching. He finds someone who is actually <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> what he has to say; however, he fails to teach them anything about the religion. As a final attempt, Peter tries Hinduism; when he tackles the Hindu leader to the floor, believing the red dot on his head to be a laser spot from a sniper rifle, he is dismissed from the meeting. Unable to find a religion suited to him, Peter decides to create his own religion, based on Happy Days, calling his newly founded church the [...] "First United Church of the Fonz".|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{concert was}} first {{announced}} by Winfried Fechner in March 2010 as Symphonic Odysseys - Uematsu in Concert, with the subtitle later changed to [...] "Tribute to Nobuo Uematsu". The sole composer {{featured in the}} concert is Nobuo Uematsu, a Japanese video game composer {{best known for his}} work at Square Enix, who {{is considered one of the}} most famous and respected composers in the video game community. He has composed the music for dozens of video games, including the majority of the Final Fantasy series, and his compositions had been a significant component of the Symphonic Fantasies concert. Böcker has said that he considers Uematsu to be [...] "the most famous composer of video game music and in general one of the most influential", and that Uematsu's 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002 was a big influence on his own concerts. The decision to focus the event on Uematsu was made in part due to Uematsu's own desire to one day hear a concert based on his compositions as a whole; he was also very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> more experimental arrangements of his pieces than have been done in the past after watching the Symphonic Fantasies concert. A website was set up for news and updates on the concert, including video messages from Nobuo Uematsu himself. Tickets for the concert went on sale on December 1, 2010, and were sold out within 12 hours, prompting the addition of a second performance to be held earlier in the afternoon of the same day. This too sold out, resulting in a total attendance of over 4000. A third performance will be held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth a year later on June 20, 2017 in London, both by the London Symphony Orchestra.|$|E

In the letter they stated that [...] "he Committee is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> from you [...] and FBI Director Robert F.

[...] Only 28 questions were answered publicly, with 7 answered under separate cover to the Committee. Meanwhile, organisations such as the ACLU, the EFF and EPIC had not stopped opposing the most controversial parts of the Act. Three months after the official response to the Select Committee on the Judiciary, EPIC filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking the information that was not released by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the Department of Justice released a number of records in response to the request, they didn't release all the material, asserting that certain responsive records were exempt from disclosure. In order to gain access to these records, the ACLU and EPIC brought a civil action against the Department of Justice, and on November 26 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ordered the Department of Justice to complete its processing of the FOI request by January 15, 2003.|$|E
