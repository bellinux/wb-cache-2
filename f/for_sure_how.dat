5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E
500|$|Hnefatafl was {{a popular}} game in medieval Scandinavia and was {{mentioned}} {{in several of the}} Norse Sagas. [...] Some of these saga references have contributed to controversy over the possible use of dice in playing hnefatafl. [...] The rules of the game were never explicitly recorded, and only playing pieces and fragmentary boards are extant, so it is not known <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> the game was played. [...] If dice were in fact used, nothing has been recorded about how they were employed. [...] Archaeological and literary sources indicate Hnefatafl may have been played on a 1313 or an 1111 board. It became a popular game in Northern Europe during the Viking era (end of the 8thCentury to 1000C.E), a turbulent time full of conflicts. When chess became a popular game during the Middle Ages, the rules of Hnefatafl were forgotten over time. Hnefatafl was particularly popular in Nordic countries and followed the Viking civilization to other parts of Europe, primarily to the British Isles and the Viking country of Gardarike. The game developed differently at different locations. [...] Archaeologists have found editions in places such as Ireland and Ukraine. Hnefatafl literally translates to [...] "fist table," [...] from the Old Icelandic (equivalently in modern Icelandic) hnef, 'fist', and tafl, 'table'. The study of medieval manuscripts and examination of pieces and boards has allowed researchers to figure out how the game was probably played. It was last recorded to have been played in Wales during 1587 and Lapland in 1723.|$|E
2500|$|The {{box office}} gross of The Birth of a Nation is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration. At {{the end of}} 1917, Epoch {{reported}} to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million, and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was {{much lower than the}} exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as [...] "state's rights" [...] distribution). The film historian Richard Schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that [...] "Birth certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run". By 1940 Time magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. For years Variety had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million. It is not known <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> much the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version. It is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.|$|E

30|$|The {{dissociation}} {{of sense}} of agency and sense of ownership is <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> but <b>how</b> these two senses {{interact with each other}} is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that sense of agency seems to promote the integration of the sense of ownership, pure sense of ownership is fragmentary, and sense of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which sense of agency and sense of ownership are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience sense of agency with sense of ownership, the role of these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when sense of agency and sense of ownership were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that sense of agency and sense of ownership have no interactions. The interaction of modality and synchronicity {{had a significant impact on}} sense of ownership rather than sense of agency, indicating sense of agency seems to increase sense of ownership but not vice versa.|$|R
