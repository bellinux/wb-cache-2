40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{analytical}} {{treatment of the}} equation of motion of single bunch particles traveling in the linac of a linear collider, {{in the presence of}} wakefields. Using a somewhat simplified model, the equation is solved for a Gaussian distribution of charge, a linear variation of the wakefield along the bunch, a smooth focusing {{and in the absence of}} acceleration. The specificity of the method consists of preventing the appearance of artificial secular terms and keeping at any stage the intrinsic tune-shift that characterizes the problem and stabilizes the motion. Hence, a first order perturbation becomes sufficient provided that a non-standard perturbation expansion, specially developed for this analysis, be however applied. Solutions for the particle off-sets within the bunch are obtained and their contributions to the effective emittance calculated. The results explain the observed features of beam breakup and BNS damping, and reproduce the bunch dipole-oscillations visible on the animated graphics after simulations with the code MUSTAFA. This treatment provides in addition a closed expression for the tune shift along the bunch and confirms the existence of an optimum BNS <b>damping</b> <b>setting</b> which differs from autophasing in a single bunch mode...|$|E
40|$|Precise {{measurements}} of the minimal fluorescence yield (Fo) and maximal fluorescence yield (Fm) of a dark-adapted sample are prerequisites for the quantification of other fluorescence parameters. The pulse amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM 101 Chlorophyll Fluorometer, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and saturating pulse technique have frequently been used in measuring Fo and Fm and in resolving the contributions of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching to the total fluorescence yield. The extent to which instrument-dependent factors may affect the accurate measurement of Fo and Fm is addressed. It is shown {{that the increase in}} pulse amplitude-modulated measuring beam intensity at 1. 6 and 100 kHz was nonlinear at higher light intensity settings. The implications of this for {{measurements of}} Fo (1. 6 kHz) and Fm (100 kHz) are discussed. It is also demonstrated that underestimation of Fm may result due to saturation of the PAM 101 photodiode by scattered infrared light associated with intense light pulses. In addition, it is shown how sample-dependent factors may affect measurements of Fo and Fm in samples with low chlorophyll concentrations, in particular, dilute algal suspensions of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A technique is presented for the accurate measurement of Fo in algal suspensions (< 8 μg chlorophyll a mL− 1).

40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the need for control of flexural vibrations of lightweight plates. It addresses application of the level set method in optimal control of vibrations in plate-like structures. One {{of the most commonly}} practiced methods in control of vibration is to apply constrained layer damping patches to the surface of a structure. In order to consider the weight efficiency of the structure, the best shape and locations of the patches should be determined to achieve the optimum vibration suppression with lowest amount of damping patch. A novel topology optimization approach is proposed that is capable of finding the optimum shape and locations of the patches simultaneously. A 2 D cantilever plate, undergoing flexural vibrations, will be considered. The optimal <b>damping</b> <b>set</b> will be found in the structure, such that the lowest modal energy in the fundamental vibration mode of the system is achieved.

In this study,pyrolysis of EFB and PKS were investigated by using a direct heated pyrolysis reactor. The comparison of the conversion bio-oil obtained from this two different type of sample were studied. Since,a good EFB samples are very limited, the study of effect on reactor temperature and heating rate to the conversion of bio-oil was investigated by using PKS sample. The reaction temperature examined in this study was varied in the range of 300 - 500 oC. Meanwhile, air <b>damper</b> <b>setting</b> in the range of 2. 0 - 4. 0 with a constant fuel setting at 19 mmbar were studied. In addition,the competiveness of the direct heated reactor also was investigated by making the comparison in term of percentage of bio-oil conversion with electric heated reactor used worldwide. For the conversion of bio-oil between EFB and PKS, PKS recorded higher yields of bio-oil compared to EFB. The highest conversions of bio-oil were gained at the reaction temperature of 400 oC and air <b>damper</b> <b>setting</b> at 4 respectively. The study of the compatibility of direct fired reactor showed that the direct fired reactor was competitive since the conversion of bio-oil was in the range recorded by the electric heated reactor.

Then, by means of gradient Young measures, we obtain a relaxed formulation {{of the problem in}} which the original cost density is replaced by its constrained quasi-convexification. This implies that the new relaxed problem is well-posed in the sense that there exists a minimizer and, in addition, the infimum of the original problem coincides with the minimum of the relaxed one. In a second numerical part, we address the resolution of the relaxed problem using a first-order gradient descent method. We present some numerical experiments which highlight the influence of the over-damping phenomena and show that for large values of the damping potential the original problem has no minimizer. We then propose a penalization technique to recover the minimizing sequences of the original problem from the optimal solution of the relaxed one...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated Raman {{backscattering}} in plasma {{has been}} suggested {{as a way to}} amplify short laser pulses to intensities not limited by damage thresholds as in chirped pulse amplification using conventional media. Energy is transferred between two transverse electromagnetic waves, pump and probe, through the parametric interaction with a longitudinal Langmuir wave that is ponderomotively excited by their beat wave. The increase of the plasma temperature due to collisional absorption of the pump wave modifies the dispersion of the Langmuir wave: firstly, its resonance frequency rises (Bohm-Gross shift), and secondly, Landau <b>damping</b> <b>sets</b> in. The frequency shift acts in a similar way to a chirp of the pump frequency, or a density ramp: different spectral components of the probe satisfy the resonance condition at different times. This limits their growth, while increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier, thus leading to superradiant amplification. Landau damping may shorten the probe pulse, but reduces the amplification efficiency. We investigate these effects analytically and using numerical simulations in order to assess their importance in experimental demonstrations, and the possibility of applications...|$|R

40|$|Bloch {{analysis}} was originally developed by Felix Bloch to solve Schrödinger's equation for the electron wave {{function in a}} periodic potential field, such as that found in a pristine crystalline solid. His method has since been adapted to study elastic wave propagation in periodic structures. The absence of a rigorous mathematical analysis of the approach, as applied to periodic structures, has resulted in mistreatment of internal forces and misapplication to nonlinear media. In this thesis, we detail a mathematical basis for Bloch analysis and thereby shed important light on the proper application of the technique. We show conclusively that translational invariance is not a proper justification for invoking {{the existence of a}} "propagation constant," and that in nonlinear media this results in a flawed analysis. Next, we propose a general framework for applying Bloch analysis in damped systems and investigate the effect of damping on dispersion curves. In the context of Schrödinger's equation, damping is absent and energy is conserved. In the <b>damped</b> <b>setting,</b> application of Bloch analysis is not straight-forward and requires additional considerations in order to obtain valid results. Results are presented in which the approach is applied to example structures. These results reveal that damping may introduce wavenumber band gaps and bending of dispersion curves such that two or more temporal frequencies exist for each dispersion curve and wavenumber. We close the thesis by deriving conditions which predict the number of wavevectors at each frequency in a dispersion relation. This has important implications for the number of nearest neighbor interactions that must be included in a model in order to obtain dispersion predictions which match experiment.
