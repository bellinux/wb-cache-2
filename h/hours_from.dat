5|$|The chefs were {{initially}} {{surprised at how}} busy they were at lunchtimes; Harveys had been based next to Wandsworth Common and so the typically slow lunch service was used to give the chefs a break. Now based near Hyde Park, they had {{four or five times}} the number of covers for a lunch service than before. White remained determined to gain his third Michelin star, and to achieve this, he sought to emulate and surpass the food and service at Pierre Koffman's three Michelin star restaurant La Tante Claire. White worked 14/15 hour days for six days a week, expecting similar <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> those chefs under him, with the restaurant only closed on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} taped on May 4 at Warner Bros.' studios in Burbank, California. A total of {{eight hours of}} {{material}} was filmed (two <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> {{each of the four}} cameras), which was edited down to 22 minutes under Bright's supervision. Bright submitted it to NBC on May 10, 72 hours before the fall schedule was announced. NBC ordered Bright to make further edits, which he completed at 1a.m. on May 11. On May 12, NBC screened the finished pilot to focus groups, who gave positive but mixed reactions. The network announced the fall schedule on May 13 and ordered an additional 12 episodes of Friends for its first season. Crane and Kauffman immediately received telephone calls from writers' agents who wanted to get their clients jobs on the series.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E
5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 <b>hours</b> <b>from</b> the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
