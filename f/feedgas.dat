40|$|This paper investigates {{active control}} of an {{aftertreatment}} {{system for a}} conventional spark ignition engine equipped {{with one or two}} three-way catalysts and two oxygen sensors. The control objective is to maximize the simultaneous conversion efficiencies of oxides of nitrogen and unburned hydrocarbons. Linear exhaust gas oxygen sensors are used to measure air-fuel ratio upstream and downstream of each catalyst. A series controller configuration is adopted. The upstream controller provides relatively rapid response to disturbances on the basis of measured <b>feedgas</b> air-fuel ratio, while the downstream controller uses the <b>feedgas</b> and post-catalyst air-fuel ratio measurements to compensate for the bias corrupting the <b>feedgas</b> air-fuel ratio measurement. The performance and robustness of the proposed control system in the face of noise and model uncertainty are first evaluated through extensive simulations. The control strategy is then experimentally verified in a dynamometer test cell and its performance compared with an existing proprietary controller that is based on the more common switching-type air-fuel ratio sensors.

The objective is to deposit high-quality boron-doped single crystal diamond and establish {{the relationships between the}} deposition conditions and the diamond growth rate and quality. Experiments are performed using type Ib HPHT diamond seeds as substrates and growing diamond with varying amounts of diborane in a methane-hydrogen gas mixture. The deposition system utilized is a 2. 45 GHz microwave plasma-assisted CVD system operating at 135 - 160 Torr. Experiments are performed with methane concentrations of 4 - 6 % and diborane concentrations of 5 - 50 ppm in the <b>feedgas.</b> Diamond is deposited with growth rates of 2 to 11 m/h in this study.

40|$|The {{influence}} of reactor wall {{conditions on the}} characteristics of high density fluorocarbon plasma etch processes has been studied. Results obtained during the etching of oxide, nitride, and silicon in an inductively coupled plasma source fed with various <b>feedgases,</b> such as CHF 3, C 3 F 6, and C 3 F 6 /H 2, indicate that the reactor wall temperature is an important parameter in the etch process. Adequate temperature control can increase oxide etch selectivity over nitride and silicon. The loss of fluorocarbon species from the plasma to the walls is reduced as the wall temperature increased. The fluorocarbon deposition on a cooled substrate surface increases concomitantly, resulting in a more efficient suppression of silicon and nitride etch rates, whereas oxide etch rates remain nearly constant...|$|R
40|$|By using a Ni-MgO catalyst, carbon {{nanotubes}} {{with small}} and even diameter could be prepared from catalytic decomposition of CH 4 or CO. These carbon nanotubes prepared by this method {{are more or}} less twisted, with the outer diameter at 15 - 20 nm, and the tube length up to 10 mu m. The results of XRD measurements and pulse reaction testing indicated that the NiO and MgO components in this catalyst precursor formed, due to their highly mutual solubility, a NixMg 1 -xO solid solution. The high dispersion of Ni-species in this solid solution and the effect of valence-stabilization by the MgO crystal field would be in favor of inhibiting deep reduction of Ni 2 + to Ni- 0 and aggregation of the Ni- 0 to form large metal particles at the surface of catalyst, making the carbon nanotubes grown on this catalyst relatively small and even in size of diameter. The experimental results also indicated that, in the growing process of carbon nanotubes, the rate-determining step was dependent upon the conditions of preparation (i. e. <b>feedgas</b> used, reaction temperature, flow-rate of the <b>feedgas,</b> etc.). The growth mechanism of the carbon nanotubes on the Ni-MgO catalyst is discussed together with the experimental results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

In this paper, we consider the control and adaptation of aftertreatment systems involving lean NO x trap (LNT). A phenomenological LNT model is presented to facilitate the model-based control and adaptation. A control strategy based on the LNT model and HEGO (heated exhaust gas oxygen) sensor feedback is discussed. A linear parametric model, which is derived by exploiting the physical properties of the LNT is used for adaptation of trap capacity and <b>feedgas</b> NO x emission models. The conditions under which parameter convergence will be achieved are derived for the proposed adaptive scheme.

In order to improve understanding of diesel soot oxidation, an experimental rig was designed and set up, in which the soot oxidation conditions, such as temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and CO 2 partial pressure, could be varied independently of each other. The oxidizing gas flow in the oxidizer was under laminar condition. This test rig comprised a naturally-aspirated single cylinder engine which acted as the soot generator, and a separate premixed oxidation burner system in which soot extracted from the engine was oxidized under controlled conditions. Diesel soot was extracted from the engine exhaust pipe and from the engine pre-combustion chamber, and the soot-laden gas was then conveyed to the burner where it was oxidized.

The hot gases from the flame flew upwards through a quartz transparent tube which acted as the soot oxidation duct. The soot-laden gas from the engine was premixed with the <b>feedgas</b> (itself a premixed mixture of methane, air, oxygen, and nitrogen) to the burner.

The catalyst structure was examined by XRD, XPS, STEM-EDX, HR-TEM and UV–Vis spectroscopy {{and related to}} the catalyst activity. Methane conversion strongly depends on Ag state and dispersion. At low Ag loading (< 2 at%), small Ag particles (< 5 nm) have low activity. The turnover frequency for methane oxidation increases as the Ag particle size increases from 5 to 10 nm as determined from HRTEM, while the activation energy remains the same. Ag ion-exchanged ZSM- 5 zeolite materials, containing Ag in highly dispersed state as isolated Ag were studied for comparison. High conversion of methane was found only in zeolite catalysts containing {{a large amount of}} silver, some of which was in particle form.

To form n+-type regions in diamond for semiconductor devices it is beneficial to deposit on the (111) surface. However, diamond deposition is faster and of higher quality on the (001) surface. A preferential etch method is described that forms inverted pyramids on the (001) surface of a substrate diamond crystal, which opens (111) faces for improved phosphorus incorporation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the basic mechanisms responsible for the synthesis of nanostructured diamond films in a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) process and to identify plasma chemistry suitable for controlling the morphology and electrical properties of deposited films. The nanostructured diamond films were synthesized by MPCVD on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy substrates using H 2 /CH 4 /N 2 precursor gases and the plasma chemistry was monitored by the optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The synthesized thin-films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The addition of B 2 H 6 to the <b>feedgas</b> during MPCVD of diamond thin-films changes the crystal grain size from nanometer to micron scale. Nanostructured diamond films grown with H 2 /CH 4 /N 2 gases demonstrate a broad (111) Bragg x-ray diffraction peak (Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) = 0. 93 ° 2 θ), indicating a small grain size, whereas scans show a definite sharpening of the diamond (111) peak (FWHM = 0. 30 ° 2 θ) with the addition of boron. OES showed a decrease in CN (carbon–nitrogen) radical in the plasma with B 2 H 6 addition to the gas mixture.

40|$|AbstractA key {{challenge}} for future clean power or hydrogen projects via gasification {{is the need}} to reduce the overall cost while achieving significant levels of CO 2 capture. The current state of the art technology for capturing CO 2 from sour syngas uses a physical solvent absorption process (acid gas removal–AGR) such as Selexol™ or Rectisol® to selectively separate H 2 S and CO 2 from the H 2. These two processes are expensive and require significant utility consumption during operation, which only escalates with increasing levels of CO 2 capture. Importantly, Air Products has developed an alternative option that can achieve a higher level of CO 2 capture than the conventional technologies at significantly lower capital and operating costs. Overall, the system is expected to reduce the cost of CO 2 capture by over 25 %. Air Products developed this novel technology by leveraging years of experience in the design and operation of H 2 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems in its numerous steam methane reformers. Commercial PSAs typically operate on clean syngas and thus need an upstream AGR unit to operate in a gasification process.

Of order 97 % of the individual spherical particles (spherules) had a size range from 10 to 80 nm. Occasionally, individual spherules of about 150 nm in diameter could be observed. The diesel soot particles sampled from the pre-chamber of the engine had different size distributions from those sampled from the exhaust of the engine, indicating that the soot underwent an oxidation process in the combustion chamber. Soot oxidation experiments were performed in the burner post-flame gas under oxygen partial pressures ranging from 0. 010 to 0. 050 atm and temperatures from 1520 to 1820 K. The test results showed that the oxidation rates of the diesel soot extracted from the diesel engine were generally lower than those predicted by the well-known Nagle and Strickland-Constable formula; however, the measured oxidation rates were higher than the predictions made with another well-known formula - the Lee formula. The soot extracted from the engine pre-chamber appeared not to oxidize as fast as the soot extracted from the exhaust of the engine. CO 2 gas injection to the post-flame oxidation gas at constant oxygen partial pressure and oxidation temperature seemed to have accelerated the diesel soot oxidation rate.

40|$|In {{photovoltaic}} {{thin film}} cells, a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer {{is required to}} transport current. The most common TCOs used are F:SnO 2 (fluorine doped tin oxide), ZnO (zinc oxide) and ITO (indium doped tin oxide). ZnO is normally deposited in a vacuum based process, sputtering or low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD). Atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) is an attractive alternative for ZnO deposition. A critical parameter for TCOs in photovoltaic thin films is the surface morphology which defines the optical scattering properties. The ability to control the spectral sensitivity and degree of scattering are both important process parameters for high performance cells. This thesis investigates APCVD for film growth of ZnO plus dopants (fluorine and aluminium), {{and the effects of}} atmospheric pressure plasma etching of ZnO and F:SnO 2. ZnO was deposited in multiple system geometries all based on thermal activated CVD. The oxidant source purity is shown to be critical for stable growth at higher temperatures required for dopant incorporation. A fundamental problem was encountered with fluorine doping, whereby the films would crack beyond a critical thickness. A solution was found with the development of a F:SnO 2 and F:ZnO composite stack. Photovoltaic testing of this hybrid TCO was encouraging, showing the potential benefit of the composite structure. Modification of the surface morphology was achieved by atmospheric pressure plasma, based on a dielectric barrier discharge configuration. This novel system enables the etching of TCO films without the introduction of hazardous wet chemistry. In this thesis the effects of etching regime and <b>feedgas</b> composition are studied and an etching mechanism is proposed.

40|$|The latest US {{emission}} regulations require dramatic {{reductions in}} Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions. Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) {{is the current}} technology that achieves NOx reductions of up to 90 %. It is typically mounted downstream of the existing aftertreatment system, i. e, after the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). Accurate prediction of input NO 2 :NO ratio is needed for the SCR urea injection control algorithm to reduce NOx output and NH 3 slippage downstream of the SCR catalyst. Most oxidation of NO to NO 2 occurs in the DOC since its main function is to oxidize emission constituents. The DOC thus determines the NO 2 :NO ratio as <b>feedgas</b> to the SCR catalyst. The prediction of NO 2 :NO ratio varies as the catalyst in the DOC ages or deteriorates due to poisoning. Therefore, the prediction cannot be determined by a single model. Instead, the model should {{take into account the}} correlation of DOC conversion effectiveness and the aging of the catalyst. This research project is aimed at detecting the aging level in the DOC in real time on board the vehicle by estimating light-off temperature. Initial light-off analysis was conducted on catalyzed DPF (CDPF) with the instrumentation of 12 thermocouples. An improvement on the existing light-off temperature detection equation provided by Cummins was done by adding substrate heat rate storage term. This finding was then implemented on the instrumented DOC for light-off temperature analysis with testing to simulate transient exhaust temperature. Evaluation of the equation terms showed that heat loss analysis to the surroundings is negligible while the post-fueling to the exhaust stream was found to have a significant discrepancy to the commanded quantity. A comparison analysis for the fresh and aged DOC was conducted. Clear light off temperature shifts were detected between both and the indirect estimation could roughly predict the aged DOC conversion. However, the technology is still preliminary and further work on data repeatability and consistency needs to be done before the technology can be adopted for real world application. ...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{processing}} of advanced photoresist (PR) materials {{is a critical}} step in nano-manufacturing. We have studied the interactions of PRs and polymers in fluorocarbon/Ar discharges. The effects of process time, PR material, bias and source power, pressure and gas chemistry (C 4 F 8 /Ar, CF 4 /Ar and CF 4 /H 2 /Ar) were studied by ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Additionally, patterned structures of 193 nm PR were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Polymer destruction in the top surface, oxygen and hydrogen loss along with fluorination were observed for all materials initially, which was followed by steady state etch conditions. A strong dependence of plasma-induced surface chemical and morphological changes on polymer structure was observed. In particular, the adamantane group of 193 nm PR showed poor stability. Two linked mechanisms for the roughening behavior of the films during processing were identified: A physical pattern transfer mechanism enhances initial roughness by non-uniform removal. Additional to that, roughness formation occurred linear to the energy density deposited during processing. For adamantyl polymers, a higher roughening constant was found. Additionally, fluorocarbon (FC) deposition on the damaged PR affected roughening in two opposing ways: Ion-induced mixing with the damaged PR increased roughening, whereas for simple FC precursor deposition a reduction of roughness was seen. Fluorination of the PR surfaces using plasma increased etching yields, which were found to improve the roughness of 193 nm PR after etch. The fluorination of the PR prevented the formation of characteristic small scale roughness features {{at the cost of}} large scale roughness introduction. Use of low energy density processes suppressed the roughness growth by ion-induced transfer. Examining 3 -dimensional trenches and contact holes patterned in PR showed that the sidewall roughness changed with process parameters similar to that seen for blanket films. The close correlation suggested that our model of polymer surface roughening also applies to resist sidewall evolution during etch. All process conditions can be combined in the energy density roughening model. Even for various <b>feedgas</b> chemistries adamantyl containing polymers show enhanced roughening rates, suggesting that the instability of the adamantyl structure used in 193 nm PR polymers is the performance limiting factor for processing PR materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} nanocrystalline diamond and {{tetrahedral}} amorphous carbon films {{has been the}} focus of intense experimental activity in the last few years for applications in field emission display devices, optical windows, and tribological coatings, The choice of substrate used in most studies has typically been silicon. For metals, however, the thermal expansion mismatch between the diamond film and substrate gives rise to thermal stress that often results in delamination of the film. To avoid this problem in conventional CVD deposition low substrate temperatures (less than 700 C) have been used, often with the incorporation of oxygen or carbon monoxide to the <b>feedgas</b> mixture. Conventionally grown CVD diamond films are also rough and would require post-deposition polishing for most applications. Therefore, there is an obvious need to develop techniques for deposition of well-adhered, smooth nano-structured diamond films on metals for various tribological applications. In our work, nanostructured diamond films are grown on a titanium alloy substrate using a two-step deposition process. The first step is performed at elevated temperature (820 C) for 30 minutes using a H 2 /CH 4 /N 2 gas mixture in order to grow a thin (approx. 600 nm) nanostructured diamond layer and improve film adhesion. The remainder of the deposition involves growth at low temperature (less than 600 C) in a H 2 /CH 4 /O 2 gas mixture. Laser reflectance Interferometry (LRI) pattern during growth of a nanostructured diamond film on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The first 30 minutes are at a high temperature of 820 C and the rest of the film is grown at a low temperature of 580 T. The fringe pattern is observed till the very end due to extremely low surface roughness of 40 nm. The continuation of the smooth nanostructured diamond film growth during low temperature deposition is confirmed by in-situ laser reflectance interferometry and by post-deposition micro-Raman spectroscopy and surface profilometry. Similar experiments performed without the starting nanostructured diamond layer resulted in poorly adhered films with a more crystalline appearance and a higher surface roughness. This low temperature deposition of nanostructured diamond films on metals offers advantages in cases where high residual thermal stress leads to delamination at high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Fluorocarbon (FC) plasmas are {{commonly}} used for dielectric materials etching. Our initial work was performed using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system to produce FC discharges. We first examined the effect of CO addition to C 4 F 8 or C 4 F 8 /Ar plasmas for selective etching of organosilicate glass (OSG), which is a typical low k (LK) material over etch stop layers. The chemical activity of CO when added to either C 4 F 8 or C 4 F 8 / 80 %Ar can {{be understood in terms}} of the CO dissociation energy threshold relative to energies of inelastic electron collision processes of the dominant <b>feedgas</b> component. We also studied the plasma etching behavior of 193 nm and 248 nm photoresist in FC discharges used for dielectric etching. We showed that ion-enhanced selective volatilization of carbonyl groups of the 193 nm photoresist polymer backbone which is absent for the 248 nm material, along with modulation of the ion-interaction with the photoresist material by fluorocarbon surface passivation, may be responsible for the introduction of pronounced surface roughness of 193 nm photoresists. Current industrial efforts are aimed primarily at capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) systems. A home-built dual frequency CCP reactor was used to investigate additional aspects of dielectric materials plasma etching. We designed a gap structure to simulate sidewall surface processes occurring during high aspect ratio trench etching. In particular, we showed that the FC film deposition rates measured using the gap structure qualitatively correlate with the trench sidewall angles produced in LK dielectrics in both C 4 F 8 /Ar and CF 4 /H 2 based gas chemistries: The lower the FC deposition rate on the sidewall, the more vertical the trench sidewall. This approach was used to study surface chemistry aspects of FC film deposition with and without ion bombardment. For the gap structure film deposition takes place without ion bombardment and we observed a novel FC film growth phenomenon in pure C 4 F 8 plasmas at high pressure: Two distinct chemical surface portions were shown to exist simultaneously, one consisting primarily of C-F 2 and C-F 3 bonding, and the other of C-C/C-H bonding. An explanation consistent with all of our data is localized CF 2 attachment to growing FC chains...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} survey of LNG processes suitable for offshore environment has been evaluated. Thesurvey has been performed {{with emphasis on}} space requirements, complexity, efficiency and safety. Thermodynamics theory is described and used {{in the investigation of}} the NicheLNG process. Theliquefaction part of the HLNG FPSO- 1 has been evaluated with respect to its energy consumption,improvements and the possibility to expand the process to give an indication about improvementpotentials. In addition, one alternative liquefaction process has been compared with the NicheLNGprocess. Dual expander processes based on nitrogen as refrigerant are the most proposed solution suitable foroffshore applications. Therefore it was chosen as an alternative process to NicheLNG. In theinvestigation of the two processes the processes simulated were with equal conditions. The NicheLNGprocess, based on an open methane cycle and a nitrogen cycle, had a significantly lower mass flow rateresulting in 10 % lower power consumption. Decision of chosen refrigerant gas (methane or nitrogen) has different specific heat capacity and hence an influence on the flow rate. Methane as refrigerantrequires less mass flow rate than nitrogen for a given duty. In addition, higher pressure levels willcontribute to increased efficiency and reduced unit sizes. In the open refrigeration cycle of the NicheLNG process, methane is cooled down to - 1, 5 °C before itis expanded. If the internal heat exchange is extended to - 10 °C before expansion is it possible toachieve some efficiency increase for the methane cycle. Comparison criteria are important when the quality of liquefaction processes is to be determined. Feedand product specifications provide some restrictions on obtainable efficiency. With an increasing <b>feedgas</b> pressure, the whole liquefaction process (from feed to LNG) demands less work, but the overallprocess efficiency is reduced due to the high efficiency of the feed gas compressor and the lowefficiency of the liquefaction part. Hence, the efficiency of the liquefaction process should not becalculated from its feed gas pressure but rather the liquefaction pressure. For the NicheLNG process,the exergy efficiency of the liquefaction part was calculated to 26, 6 %, with a liquefaction pressure at 75 bar. An increase of LNG production with emphasis on improvements to keep work consumption down wasalso discussed. The four evaluated solutions were utilization of End Flash Gas, liquid expander,additional compressor and increase of heat exchanger area. The liquid expander was the improvementthat stands out as the highest contribution to the efficiency. With a 25 % increase in LNG productionand with new units and modifications of the design resulted in a reduction in the specific workconsumption from 0, 5502 kWh/kgLNG to 0, 4791 kWh/kgLNG. These efficiency improvements canjustify higher investment costs since the work consumption, with 25 % higher LNG production, was 12, 9 % lower than for the original design of the NicheLNG process. Never the less, space and weighton a FPSO are limited and has to be considered when a more efficient process is desired...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the role of carbon nanotubes as active catalysts in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction to derive liquid fuels from synthesis gas. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique structural and mechanical properties that make them ideal catalyst supports, but they also exhibit catalytic potential as well. This study implored the use of multi-walled CNTs on different substrates and single-walled CNTs grown from various precursors to analyze the effectiveness of the CNTs in FT synthesis. 	Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) were tested on two different substrates: alumina pellets and inconel. The MWNTs on the alumina substrate yielded nearly all alkane and alkene products, with very little aromatic products. The amount of converted syngas reached 97 % but had a high liquid product selectivity to methane, at roughly 57 %. The MWNTs on inconel substrate produced nearly 80 % aromatic products in one stage of the experiment, while the other three stages produces almost all alkane products with little oxygenates. Much of the liquid product yield (upwards of 73 %) was between C 10 and C 21, which is ideal for diesel fuel. Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) were also tested in the FTS. All of the SWNTs were tested under a series of 6 temperatures, 300 psig, and a syngas ratio of 1 : 1. Iron, nickel, and cobalt, which have all been proven as effective FT catalysts, were tested in trace amounts with CNTs. Fe-SWNTs (ferrocene assisted SWNTs) yielded a product of 100 % C 7 and C 8 carbon species at two of the temperatures while 3 of the temperatures held a combination of longer chained alkanes, of C 18 and longer. However, the last temperature converted 100 % of the <b>feedgas</b> into methane and CO 2. The product selectivity to CH 4 and CO 2 posed a problem with the Fe-SWNTs catalyst, where in all temperatures the selectivity exceeded 80 %. Ni-SWNTs (nickellocene assisted SWNTs) yielded slightly better results with a higher selectivity to C 2 -C 7, but no selectivity to longer chained hydrocarbons. Co-SWNTs (cobaltocene assisted SWNTs) tested under the same parameters yielded similar results as the Fe-SWNTs, with a very high selectivity to CH 4 and CO 2. Only at temperatures of 300 and 250 °C were there any selectivity to compounds other than CH 4 and CO 2, but less than 10 % selectivity to those alkanes (C 2 +). The final experiment consisted of a catalyst prepared from a feed solution containing a mixture of ferrocene and nickellocene. The Fe+Ni-SWNT catalyst underwent the same conditions as the other SWNT catalysts, this combination yielded favorable results with over 98 % conversion of syngas over all temperatures and a high selectivity to shorter chain length hydrocarbons, namely alkanes of chain lengths between C 2 and C 7. Although the higher temperatures did show a selectivity to methane (roughly 45 %), the CO 2 selectivity was rather low, below 10 % (except at 450 °C, which pushed 20 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{energy is}} the {{forth in the}} world total energy consumption, coming only after coal, oil, and natural gas. As a carbon resource, biomass not only {{can be used for}} heat and power generation, but it also is the only {{renewable}} energy which can be converted into liquid fuels or chemicals. Compared to the first generation biofuels the second generation biofuels have greater prospects for development, because the feedstocks are non-food crops and are more stable in supply. Biomass indirect liquefaction through gasification is regarded as the most efficient way of utilizing biomass. The FTS (Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) is a commonly used reaction in organic chemical, which is taking coal, oil or natural gas as feedstocks. FTS is the basic principle of BTL (biomass to liquid) process and produces hydrocarbons of different length from a gas mixture of H 2 and CO (syngas) from biomass gasification. At present, FTS using coal and natural gas is almost a well-established technology. However, as for FTS from biomass-derived syngas, it is still limited in laboratory stage. It is significant in science and practice to research & development proper catalyst systems and FTS processes for the biomass derived syngas. The aim of the present work is to study the FTS of biomass derived syngas on traditional FTS catalysts, and to improve the conversion by adding promoters, including: (1) under typical FTS reaction condition, comparing the reaction performances of industrial syngas (H 2 /CO= 2) and biomass syngas (H 2 /CO= 1, containing CO 2) over traditional FTS catalyst, in a fixed bed microreactor; (2) investigating the effect of manganese promoter with different loadings on the conversion and product distribution of the syngas; (3) characterizing the catalysts by XRD, H 2 -TPR, and TGA-FTIR. The results obtained are listed as follows: 1. FT reactions were carried out under 240 oC, 2. 0 MPa, 1000 h- 1, using industrial syngas and biomass syngas as <b>feedgas.</b> It was found that (1) the 20 wt% Co/SiO 2 catalyst used had higher activity and the CO conversion of the industrial syngas was over 90 %; (2) FTS from the biomass syngas is possible to obtain liquid hydrocarbons over Co/SiO 2 catalyst, and the selectivity of CH 4 is lower. However, the CO conversion of biomass syngas (less than 30 %) is much lower than that of industrial syngas. The product of biomass syngas tended to be higher carbon number hydrocarbons, and the selectivity of C 5 + was 80. 62 %. The average yield of C 5 + after 24 h-reaction was 131. 30 g/m 3 (syngas). 2. The Co/SiO 2 catalyst was promoted by impregnation with different amounts of manganese (0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 5, 2. 0, 5. 0, and 7. 0 wt%). (1) It was shown by XRD and H 2 -TPR that Mn made the particle size of Co 3 O 4 be smaller and hampered the reduction of Co 3 O 4 to Co 0, which probably was caused by formation of CoMn oxides. (2) FT catalytic test revealed that small amount of Mn (0. 4 %, 0. 8 %) could increase the CO conversion and selectivity of C 5 +. On the cobalt catalyst promoted by 0. 8 % Mn, the CO conversion of biomass syngas was the highest (52. 55 %) and CH 4 selectivity is lower(9. 93 %). Loading of more than 0. 8 % Mn resulted in a decrease in activity and C 5 + selectivity and an increase in olefin content in light hydrocarbons. (3) Stability of the cobalt catalyst in the atmosphere of biomass syngas was improved by adding Mn. The average CO conversion after 24 h-reaction was increased from 29. 13 % (over Co/SiO 2) to 42. 38 % (over Co-(0. 8 %) Mn/SiO 2). The average selectivity of C 5 + hydrocarbons was 78. 99 %, and the average yield was 154. 9 g/m 3 (syngas) (4) The average flux of the off-gas accounted for about 50 % of the syngas. Based on the composition, the heat value of the FT off-gas of biomass syngas over Co-(0. 8 %) Mn/SiO 2 is about 14. 54 MJ/m 3. Deposition of carbon and small amount of heavy hydrocarbons on the catalysts surface was one of the possible reasons for the catalyst deactivation. 生物质能是仅次于煤炭、石油和天然气而居于世界能源消费总量第四位的能源，它不仅可用于取热和发电，而且也是可再生能源中唯一可以转化为液体燃料或化学品的碳源。第二代生物质液体燃料由于其原料来源稳定、不会和粮食相互竞争，具有非常巨大的发展前景，其中通过气化合成液体燃料的生物质间接液化技术被认为是最有效的方式之一。F-T合成（Fischer-Tropsch synthesis）是以煤、石油、天然气为原料的有机化工中常用的C 1 化学反应，是生物质合成液体燃料的原理基础，可将生物质合成气（CO+H 2 ）转化为不同链长的碳氢化合物。我国的生物质F-T合成液体燃料技术尚处于实验研究阶段，开发适用于生物质气质特点的催化剂体系和F-T和合成工艺具有重要的科学和现实意义。 本文侧重研究生物质合成气在传统F-T合成催化剂Co/SiO 2 上的反应性能，并通过添加助剂对催化剂进行改性，以提高生物质合成气F-T合成的转化率为目标，主要研究内容包括：（ 1 ）在传统F-T合成Co基催化剂，固定床微型反应器上考察并对比工业合成气（H 2 /CO= 2 ）和生物质合成气（H 2 /CO= 1 ，含有CO 2 ）F-T合成反应的差别；（ 2 ）添加Mn助剂对Co/SiO 2 催化剂进行改性，考察不同含量的Mn助剂对工业合成气和生物质合成气F-T合成转化率及产物分布的影响。（ 3 ）采用X射线衍射（XRD），H 2 程序升温还原（H 2 -TPR），热重红外联用等手段对催化剂进行表征。通过实验研究得到以下主要结论： 1 、在 240 oC， 2. 0 MPa， 1000 h- 1 典型的F-T合成反应条件下，分别用工业合成气和模拟生物质合成气在Co/SiO 2 催化剂上进行反应。（ 1 ）所制备的 20 wt% Co/SiO 2 催化剂具有较高的F-T合成反应活性，工业合成气CO转化率可达 90 %以上。（ 2 ）生物质合成气可以在Co/SiO 2 催化剂上通过F-T合成反应生成液态烃类，且CH 4 选择性低。但与工业合成气相比，生物质合成气CO转化率低，小于 30 %，且催化剂失活较快。产物分布向高碳数迁移，C 5 +烃类选择性可达 80. 62 %， 24 h后C 5 +收率平均值为 131. 30 g/m 3 (syngas) 。 2 、在Co/SiO 2 催化剂中添加不同含量的Mn助剂进行改性，Mn助剂的添加量为： 0. 4 ， 0. 8 ， 1. 5 ， 2. 0 ， 5. 0 ， 7. 0 wt%，比较了Mn助剂对工业合成气和生物质合成气F-T合成的影响。（ 1 ）XRD、H 2 -TPR测试结果表明，Mn助剂的添加会影响Co/SiO 2 催化剂的分散度和Co 3 O 4 晶粒尺寸。Co和Mn可能生成低温难还原的CoMn氧化物，从而阻碍了Co的还原。（ 2 ）少量Mn的添加（ 0. 4 %， 0. 8 %）可以提高生物质合成气CO转化率和C 5 +烃类选择性。Mn含量为 0. 8 %时，CO转化率最高为 52. 55 %，产物中CH 4 含量较低，CH 4 选择性为 9. 93 %；随着Mn含量的增大，CO转化率变小，C 5 +烃类选择性降低，且产物中烯烃含量增大。（ 3 ）添加适量Mn有利于增加催化剂的稳定性及延长催化剂的寿命。Co-(0. 8 %) Mn/SiO 2 催化剂稳定性实验结果表明， 24 h后CO的平均转化率由 29. 13 %（Co/SiO 2 ）提高到 42. 38 %，C 5 +烃类平均选择性为 78. 99 %，平均收率为 154. 9 g/m 3 (syngas) （ 4 ）催化剂的失活原因之一是由于碳的沉积以及少量蜡样产物沉积引起的。由于转化率不高，尾气具有一定热值，出口尾气流量约占合成气流量的 50 %，经过计算得到尾气热值为 14. 54 MJ/Nm 3...|$|E
