25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the <b>epimerization</b> (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on the ring conformations of {{carbohydrate}} molecules; how the conformational equilibria and the rates of the associated interconversions {{are affected by the}} molecular constitution and their surroundings. The conformational equilibria of a group of amine linked pseudodisaccharides, designed as potential glycosidase inhibitors, comprising α-D-altrosides are described in Chapter 3. The OS 2 conformation was largely populated, and the ring conformation was found to depend on the charge of the amine functionality. The conformations of β-D-xylopyranoside derivatives with naphthyl-based aglycones, which are potential anti-cancer agents, are described in chapter 4. Solvent dependent flexibility was observed. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds were concluded {{to be involved in the}} stabilization of 1 C 4 conformers in non-hydrogen bonding solvents of low polarity. Chapter 5 describes the first measurements of the conformational exchange rates of mannuronic acid ester derivatives between the 4 C 1 and 1 C 4 conformations, through DNMR measurements. The relative reactivity of glycosyl triflates as electrophiles in glycosylation reactions were investigated with NMR-based competition experiments. In Chapter 6, investigations of ruthenium-catalyzed <b>epimerizations</b> of the allylic alcohols of glycal derivatives, and stereoselective synthesis of esters through a DYKAT protocol, are described. The kinetics of the <b>epimerizations</b> were elaborated through different NMR-spectroscopic methods.

The biosynthesis of L-rhamnose (6 -deoxy-L-mannose) from glucose in this organism might occur either by (a) a direct conversion without cleavage of the glucose carbon chain, or (b) a recondensation of two three-carbon fragments derived from glycolysis. A direct con-version would require reduction of the primary alcohol group of carbon 6 and <b>epimerizations</b> of the secondary alcohol groups of carbons 3, 4, and 5. An aldolase-type of condensation between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and L-lactaldehyde followed by <b>epimerizations</b> at carbons 3 and 4, or a condensation involving aldolase and as yet un-known, could be involved in the synthesis of L-rhamnose from smaller fragments by way of L-rhamnulose.

Tracer studies with [14 C]rinderine and its N-oxide revealed that P. boucardi sequesters both alkaloidal forms {{with the same}} efficiency, but accumulates exclusively tertiary alkaloids. There is no substantial alkaloid accumulation in the body outside the defensive glands. Feeding studies with [2 H][14 C]rinderine confirmed that P. boucardi specifically epimerizes rinderine to its stereoisomers intermedine and lycopsamine. Feeding studies with [2 H][14 C]retronecine proved the ability of P. boucardi to synthesize O 7 - and O 9 -(2 -hydroxyisovaleryl) -retronecine and O 7 -lactyl-O 9 -(2 -hydroxyisovaleryl) -retronecine. Both, alkaloids of the lycopsamine type and self-synthesized retronecine esters accumulate in the defensive secretions at concentrations up to 38 mM and 33 mM, respectively. The different biochemical strategies to maintain pro-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids and to prevent self-poisoning, developed by specialized insects, are compared. There are two major findings: (1) the chemical defense mediated by plant acquired pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the taxonomically related palaearctic Oreina and neotropical Platyphora leaf beetles have been evolved independently, since the biochemical mechanisms of storing and maintaining the alkaloids is completely different in the two genera; (2) unexpected parallels exist between taxonomically unrelated Coleoptera and Lepidoptera {{in their ability to}} synthesize the same retronecine esters and to catalyze the same site-specific <b>epimerizations</b> of the lycopsamine stereoisomers. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Heparan sulfates (HS) {{are highly}} {{modified}} sugar polymers in multicellular organisms that function in cell adhesion and cellular responses to protein signaling. Functionally distinct, cell type-dependent HS modification patterns arise {{as the result}} of a conserved network of enzymes that catalyze deacetylations, sulfations, and <b>epimerizations</b> in specific positions of the sugar residues. To understand the genetic interactions of the enzymes during the HS modification process, we have measured the composition of HS purified from mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans. From these measurements we have developed a genetic network model of HS modification. We find the interactions to be highly recursive positive feed-forward and negative feedback loops. Our genetic analyses show that the HS C- 5 epimerase hse- 5, the HS 2 -O-sulfotransferase hst- 2, or the HS 6 -O-sulfotransferase hst- 6 inhibit N-sulfation. In contrast, hse- 5 stimulates both 2 -O- and 6 -O-sulfation and, hst- 2 and hst- 6 inhibit 6 -O- and 2 -O-sulfation, respectively. The effects of hst- 2 and hst- 6 on N-sulfation, 6 -O-sulfation, and 2 -O-sulfation appear largely dependent on hse- 5 function. This core of regulatory interactions is further modulated by 6 -O-endosulfatase activity (sul- 1). 47 % of all 6 -O-sulfates get removed from HS and this editing process is dependent on hst- 2, thereby providing additional negative feedback between 2 -O- and 6 -O-sulfation. These findings suggest that the modification patterns are highly sensitive to the relative composition of the HS modification enzymes.

40|$|Chemical {{cross-linking}} {{of protein}} crystals form an insoluble and active protein matrix. Cross-linked protein crystals (CLPCs) have many excellent properties including high volumetric activity and stability. In this thesis CLPC technology was studied in bioseparation and biocatalytic applications. A novel immunoaffinity separation material, cross-linked antibody crystals (CLAC), {{was developed in}} this thesis for enantiospecific separation of a chiral drug, finrozole. Previously, the preparation of an antibody Fab fragment ENA 5 His capable of enantiospecific affinity separation of the chiral drug has been described. However, in a carrier-immobilized form ENA 5 His suffered from poor stability {{in the presence of}} a high concentration of organic solvents needed to release the bound drug. In this study crystallization conditions for ENA 5 His were found by means of small-scale vapor diffusion experiments. Crystallization was further scaled up to 10  ml batch crystallization with a 70  % protein yield. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking modified the ENA 5 His crystals into an insoluble form producing a CLAC matrix. The CLAC matrix packed in a column separated pure enantiomers from the racemic mixture of the drug. The CLAC matrix was totally stable at the elution conditions enabling reuse of the immunoaffinity column. However, the specific drug enantiomer binding capacity of CLAC was only 50  % of the corresponding capacity of carrier-immobilized ENA 5 His. Also a cross-linked carrier-immobilized ENA 5 His column was prepared to study the effect of bare chemical cross-linking. Surprisingly, the cross-linked immobilized ENA 5 His was as active as the native immobilized ENA 5 His and simultaneously stable against the denaturing effect of methanol. Xylose isomerase (XI) is a widely used enzyme in industry as a result of its ability to catalyze isomerization of D-glucose to D-fructose. Previously it has been shown that XI accepts all of the pentose sugars and many hexose sugars as isomerization substrates. In the present study novel tetrose isomerizations and C- 2 <b>epimerizations</b> with both the D- and L-forms of the sugars by an industrial xylose isomerase (XI) from Streptomyces rubiginosus were described. Furthermore, the results showed that the real equilibrium of XI catalyzed reactions is not between two isomers but between a ketose and its two aldose isomers. These findings together with previous results show that XI can be used as a catalyst for production of a variety of sugars. Obtaining homogeneous enzyme crystals is critical to their application as catalysts in a cross-linked form. In this study a method for the production of homogeneous crystals of XI was developed. Firstly, the XI crystal solubility was measured with respect to precipitant salt concentration, temperature, and pH. Secondly, based on the results of the solubility study, a process for the production of uniform XI crystals of different size classes was developed. Crystals with average crystal sizes between 12  µm and 360  µm were produced. XI crystals were further cross-linked by glutaraldehyde and L-lysine to prepare insoluble cross-linked xylose isomerase crystals (CLXIC). The cross-linking of XI crystals improved their stability towards organic solvents. This can be exploited in the production of D-fructose and possibly also other sugars. Adding acetone to the reaction mixture enhanced the production of D-fructose from D-glucose catalyzed by CLXIC in terms of product yield and reaction rate. The D-fructose equilibrium concentration increased from 49  % to 64  % when increasing the acetone concentration from 0  % to 90  % in the reaction mixture at 50  °C. In 50  % acetone the fructose production rate was more than doubled compared with that in a pure buffer solvent. Acetone seems to have only a minor role in the inactivation of cross-linked crystals. The residual activity of CLXIC was 70 - 80  % of the initial activity after a 24 -h incubation at 50  °C in a buffer solution (pH  7. 2) containing 10 - 90  % acetone. In the soluble form, the activity of XI decreased by 75  % after incubation in 50  % acetone for 24  h at 50  °C. reviewe...|$|R
