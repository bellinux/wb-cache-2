40|$|The {{operational}} safety and maintenance cost of railway transportare largely {{influenced by the}} geometric characteristics of thetrack. One of the major geometric parameters essential for safeand high performance of railway track is the gauge. Thephenomenon of <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> is the gradual increase of thegauge size {{and it is one}} of the major track failure modes that couldcause derailments if it is not effectively restored in due time. Excessive <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> is as a result of inadequate lateral trackresistance and lateral rail strength capacity as influenced bysleeper, fastener ballast or subgrade conditions. This paperpresents an exploratory analysis of gauge measurement data tosummarize the main characteristics and explain the progression ofgauge widening in different curve types. The measurement datawere collected from 2007 to 2013 in curves with different layoutsand structures. The growth of gauge over time is analysed andalso the variation in the gauge dimension with the layout of thetrack is presented for engineering considerations. Apparently,gauges of all the curves studied are above the nominal dimensionof 1435 mm but below the immediate action limit. The resultshows that curve radius has significant effect on the rate of gaugewidening as it has been shown that tight curves A and B have highrates of deterioration while curves D and E with large radius haverelatively low rates of deterioration. A practical application of thisstudy is the use of the presented quality assessment procedure andthe estimated <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> rate for condition evaluation andmaintenance planning.

40|$|Methods for simulation-based {{optimisation}} of {{the design}} of railway turnouts (switches & crossings, S&C) are developed and demonstrated. Building on knowledge of dynamic wheel–rail interaction in turnouts, it is investigated how rail profile degradation can be reduced by the optimisation of geometry and component stiffness of the track superstructure. It is assumed that reduced rail profile degradation will reduce the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of turnouts. In order to obtain robust optimised designs that perform well in situ, the influence of spread in traffic parameters, such as wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient, is accounted for in the optimisations. For this purpose, studies of the correlation between wheel profile characteristics and damage in S&C are performed to allow for an efficient parameter sampling using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Track gauge optimisation in the switch panel is performed using a multi-objective optimisation approach to highlight the design trade-off in performance between different traffic routes and moves. The objective is to minimise rail and wheel wear as estimated by the energy dissipation in the wheel‒rail contacts. As track <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> affects the switch rail design, the switch rail geometry {{is linked to the}} <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> in the parameterisation. It is found that gauge configurations with a large maximum <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> for the straight stock rail are optimal for both the through and diverging routes, while the results for the curved stock rail show a more significant route dependence. A method for the optimisation of switch rail profile geometry is presented, where the geometry parameterisation is inspired by a manufacturing process for switch rails. It is found that increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred to reduce the energy dissipation and wheel‒rail contact pressures when a nominal S 1002 wheel profile is used as input. It is concluded that accurate constraints on allowable switch rail loading need to be established to determine the feasible design space for switch rail geometry optimisation. A method for the optimisation of crossing geometry is also introduced. The rail cross-sections are optimised for minimum wheel‒rail contact pressure. Further, the longitudinal height profiles of the wing rails and crossing nose are optimised to minimise an estimate of the accumulated damage in the transition zone. The optimisation is computationally efficient which makes it possible to account for very large samples of wheel profiles. An investigation and demonstration of the constraints imposed on the crossing design by the spread in profile and lateral displacement of passing wheels is presented. Supplementary to the optimisation studies is the comparison of simulation results to field measurement data to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the utilised model of dynamic vehicle‒track interaction, as well as a demonstration of a methodology that simulates rail profile degradation for a given mixed traffic situation...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum <b>gauge</b> <b>widening.</b> Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations and {{structure}} borne noise due to train transit in underground railways {{is still one}} of the major technical issues for both network operators and companies involved in track engineering and construction. Various kind of ballastless track systems are often installed in tunnels of urban mass transit systems to reduce vibrations {{and structure}} borne noise [1]. This paper deals with an innovative embedded-rail track system which is designed for combining the advantages of improved vibration attenuation with those of reduced maintenance costs. An integrated approach to support the system design is illustrated, which consists in 2 D modelling, finite element analysis, lab tests and time-domain numerical simulation of train-track dynamic interaction. In particular, starting from the results of smallscale lab tests for system dynamic characterization, a multi-axial rheologic model of the embedded rail has been identified. This model has then been implemented into the simulation code for train-track dynamic interaction, thus allowing to accurately estimate both the quasi-static and dynamic performances of the embedded rail track system. Experimental tests on a test section of the considered innovative embedded-rail track system have been carried out showing that the developed integrated approach was able to correctly predict both the static and dynamic behavior of the system during train transit in terms of <b>gauge</b> <b>widening</b> and vertical rail deflection...|$|E
