500|$|While Lopez and Anthony were {{recording}} the song, Lopez {{came up with}} the video concept. Lopez recalled the events by stating: [...] "And I asked him [...] if he liked it. And I actually <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Tommy and him at the same time another day in the studio after the song was recorded and they both loved it." [...] The music video for [...] "No Me Ames" [...] was directed by Kevin Bray in Los Angeles, California, the day after she shot the music video for [...] "If You Had My Love". The video features Lopez and Anthony as two lovers. Anthony dies of an unnamed illness. His spirit watches over a grieving Lopez. Of the video, Lopez stated that it is [...] "like a foreign movie, like 'Life Is Beautiful'". The music video received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Short Form Music Video. The music video was included on the DVD set for Lopez's compilation album, The Reel Me (2003).|$|E
500|$|Selena {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} writing and recording a track based on a story about her grandparents titled [...] "Amor Prohibido". She <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> A.B. who began co-writing it with Astudillo and herself. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as [...] "forbidden love". Pérez wrote that during its recording session: here was a noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo, especially. I can't {{say that it was}} an improvement, exactly, because I always thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible. It's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before, and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result. While recording the song, Selena had ad-libbed [...] "oh baby". Her brother believed that the recording would [...] "not have been the same if she had not added the 'oh baby' part." ...|$|E
500|$|Its taxonomic {{placement}} {{has been}} controversial {{and subject to}} change. [...] In 1951, Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott assigned O. g. brookei as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika (Ochotona rutila), but it is now treated as a subspecies of Glover's pika. Pen et al., in 1962, descriped the Muli pika (Ochotona muliensis) as {{a new form of}} the Glover's pika, but it is now considered an independent species based on skull morphology. [...] The Glover's pika was earlier treated as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika, but it is now considered as an independent species based on the skull morphology, pelage color, and zoogeography. It had also been treated as a subspecies of the Chinese red pika (Ochotona erythrotis) partly because of its assignment under the Turkestan red pika. According to morphological and molecular studies,the Glover's pikais closely related to the Chinese red pika and the two are sister groups. In 1948, Argyropulo described the species Ochotona kamensis, and <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be the larger and more differentiated than the Chinese red pika and the Glover's pika. In 1985, after observing striking similarities between their skull structures and coat colors, Feng and Zheng synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri. In 1988, however, Erbajeva synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri brookei, and retained the name kamensis, as she did not use the principle of priority which recognizes the first valid application of a name to a plant or animal.|$|E

2500|$|The word {{appeared}} in print {{as early as}} 1903 in the United Kingdom and 1904 in the United States, when novelist Desmond Coke used it in his college story of Oxford life, Sandford of Merton: [...] "There's a stunning flapper". In 1907 English actor George Graves <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Americans as theatrical slang for acrobatic young female stage performers. The flapper was {{also known as a}} dancer, who danced liked a bird-flapping her arms while doing the Charleston dance move. This move became quite a competitive dance during this era.|$|E
2500|$|J. Peter Dunston, a Washington, D.C., {{businessman}} who was spending {{a year in}} Los Angeles, was [...] "surprised" [...] in February 1978 to find [...] "how directly" [...] the prejudices of the Jonathan Club were expressed when he applied for membership and was interviewed by the membership committee.

2500|$|... "By Malachi": literally, by {{the hand}} of Malachi (comp. Jeremiah 37:2). Malachi is the proper name of the prophet, and not a mere {{official}} designation. The LXX. renders, ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου αὐτοῦ, [...] "{{by the hand}} of his angel," [...] or" [...] messenger," [...] and some curious theories have been founded on this translation; e.g. that an angel was the real author of the book, or came and <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the people. A similar legend once obtained concerning Haggai, called" [...] The Lord's Messenger" [...] (Haggai 1:13). At {{the end of the}} verse the LXX. adds, [...] "fix it in your hearts," [...] which Jerome supposes to have been imported hither from Haggai 2:15.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and {{we were trying to}} figure out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first alleged {{sexual act}} was of Jackson masturbating Gavin on Jackson's bed. Jackson {{allegedly}} initiated the molestation by urging the accuser to masturbate, {{telling him that}} boys who didn't [...] "might rape a girl." [...] However, in a police interview before the trial, Gavin was asked what he knew about masturbation and he replied, [...] "My grandma <b>explained</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me. She told me that...if men don't do it...they might go ahead and rape a woman." [...] When asked about this coincidence, the accuser maintained that both his grandmother and Jackson had happened {{to tell him the}} same thing, but with different motives. The accuser testified that during that first sexual incident, he was wearing pajamas Jackson had given him, and {{that the two of them}} [...] "were under the covers." [...] Jackson allegedly manipulated the accuser's genitals for about five minutes, causing the accuser to ejaculate (count 2). Afterwards, the accuser averred, Jackson told him [...] "it was okay" [...] and they [...] "just went to sleep." [...] The next night, Gavin testified, [...] "the same thing happened again" [...] (count 3), in Jackson's bed, both of them wearing Jackson's pajamas, but now they were on top of the covers and maybe [...] "watching T.V. or something." [...] This time, Jackson also tried to guide the accuser's hand to Jackson's genitals, but the accuser pulled away (count 6). Gavin couldn't remember for sure if he ejaculated the second time but he thought he did. In an earlier interview with Sneddon, the accuser claimed he had been molested before the rebuttal video, but in court he testified that all molestation took place after the video was filmed. The number of times he claimed to have been molested is also unclear, as he only testified in court about two incidents, but he had previously told Sergeant Steve Robel that he thought it was [...] "between five and seven times." ...|$|E
