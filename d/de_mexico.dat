5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma <b>de</b> <b>México</b> subjected the codex to non-destructive testing {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced wear and tear, are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E
