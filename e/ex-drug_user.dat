The changing epidemiology during the last 20 years, has given a new insight on sexual transmission. In long-term monogamous heterosexual serodiscordant partners, the rate of sexual transmission is 0 - 0. 6 % per year or approximately one per 190 000 sexual contacts. However, hepatitis C infection is emerging as a sexually transmitted disease among HIV-positive {{men who have sex}} with men, who denied intravenous drug use. High-sustained virological response rates (90 %) have been reported with PegIFN-α monotherapy, with a 24 -week course. In this paper, we describe the clinical cases of two female patients with acute/recent hepatitis C. Both referred unprotected sexual contacts with a new sexual partner - chronically infected with hepatitis C on the first case and <b>ex-drug</b> <b>user</b> on the second case. After completing the 24 -week course of PegIFN-α 2 a and Ribavirin, both achieved sustained virological response. Relying on current evidence data, several aspects of the literature were reviewed in this case report, particularly focusing sexual transmission and acute hepatitis C treatment regimens. A infecção pelo vírus da hepatite C afecta 3 % da população mundial. Nos últimos 20 anos, a epidemiologia alterou-se, tendo conferido nova importância à transmissão sexual. Nos casais heterossexuais monogâmicos serodiscordantes, a taxa de transmissão sexual da hepatite C é de 0 - 0, 6 %/ano, 1 : 190 000 relações sexuais. Contudo, a infecção está a emergir como doença sexualmente transmissível nos homossexuais masculinos VIH-positivos, não utilizadores de drogas injetáveis. Na hepatite C aguda, a monoterapia com PegIFN-α, durante 24 semanas, tem registado uma taxa de resposta virológica mantida de aproximadamente 90 %. Neste trabalho, são descritos os casos clínicos de duas doentes com hepatite C aguda/recente. Previamente ao diagnóstico, ambas referiram relações sexuais desprotegidas com novo parceiro - cronicamente infectado com hepatite C no primeiro caso e ex-toxicodependente, no segundo. Nos dois casos, foi instituída terapêutica dupla com PegIFN-α 2 a e Ribavirina durante 24 semanas, tendo sido atingida resposta virológica mantida. À luz dos conhecimentos atuais, são revistos alguns aspectos da literatura, particularmente sobre a transmissão sexual e tratamento da hepatite C aguda...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the findings of a wide ranging research project looking at the extent and nature of stigma towards current and <b>ex-drug</b> <b>users</b> and their families. The research programme involved a public attitudes survey, an analysis of how drug use and drug users are portayed in the print media and a qualitaitve study of the stigma experienced by current and ex-users and their families. This research shows that people with a history of drug problems are heavily stigmatised and are seen as both blameworthy and to be feared. As a result they are subject to exclusion and discrimination in many areas. The stigmatisation of people with drug problems has serious consequences for government policy. Key policies seeking greater reintegration and recovery and moving people from benefits into work will not succeed while stigmatising attitudes are pervasive and, as a result, drug problems will remain entrenched rather than overcome. Experience from other fields, such as mental health, show that stigma can be reduced and the report suggests key areas for action...|$|R

The research was peer led by Client Forum representatives of five 'Special Community Employment' schemes and {{aimed to explore}} participant experiences of Methadone Stabilization; 'Special Community Employment' schemes, and Vocational Outcomes. A Client Forum consultation (n = 11) and Client Forum representative focus groups (n = 2) were used to finalize interview questions. In depth interviews with {{a convenience sample of}} participants from 'Special Community Employment' schemes (n = 25) were conducted. Content and thematic analysis of narratives was undertaken with Client Forum (n = 11) interpretative support. The findings are indicative of 'Special Community Employment' schemes offering methadone maintenance participants' the opportunity to commence recovery, engage in {{vocational training}} and reintegrate into the community. However, participation in these schemes appeared restrictive and operated primarily as therapeutic medium, with little individual vocational care planning, training or supported work placements. Many participants reported leaving these schemes unqualified, unemployed and experiencing little aftercare. The research underscores the need for extensive revision of 'Special Community Employment' schemes within an interagency approach, so as to provide specific therapeutic supports dependent on individual recovery stage, and client specific vocational training needs, certification, work placement and supportive aftercare...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{conducted}} an in-depth {{exploration of the}} factors which helped people to detoxify from drugs and the factors which led to relapse among 20 participants from Kathmandu and Pokhara in Nepal. Methods: The research took a phenomenological approach using in-depth interviews for data collection and all {{data were analyzed using}} a grounded theory framework. Results: The study found that detoxification and rehabilitation services for drug users were mostly provided by private organizations. Some of these organizations had a comprehensive plan, trained staff and counselors. Most counselors were <b>ex-drug</b> <b>users,</b> and they functioned as mentors and role models who helped some drug users to realize that successful detoxification from drugs is possible. This approach enabled current drug users to adhere to the detoxification program. These service providers recognized that 'frustration' and lack of support are leading causes of a relapse. The best programs included activities to help the drug users to confront these frustrations. Participants who demonstrated a strong ability to manage the frustrations inherent in drug withdrawal were considered to be more able to avoid relapse after discharge. Conclusions: The evidence-base is lacking concerning successful detoxification and rehabilitation in Nepal. There is also no clear policy on detoxification and rehabilitation services. The Government of Nepal needs to develop guidelines for coordination, supervision, monitoring, evaluation and accreditation of organizations which provide detoxification and rehabilitation services...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcing {{properties}} of psychoactive substances {{are considered to}} be critically involved in the development and maintenance of substance dependence. While accumulating evidence suggests that the sensitivity to reinforcement values may generally be altered in chronic substance users, relatively {{little is known about the}} influence reinforcing feedback exerts on ongoing decision-making in these individuals. Decision-making was investigated using the Cambridge Risk Task, in which there is a conflict between an unlikely large reward option and a likely small reward option. Responses on a given trial were analyzed with respect to the outcome on the previous trial, providing a measure of the impact of prior feedback in modulating behavior. Five different groups were compared: (i) chronic amphetamine users, (ii) chronic opiate users in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), (iii) chronic users of illicit heroin, (iv) <b>ex-drug</b> <b>users</b> who had been long-term amphetamine/opiate users but were abstinent from all drugs of abuse for at least 1 year and (v) matched controls without a history of illicit substance use. Contrary to our predictions, choice preference was modified in response to feedback only in opiate users enrolled in MMT. Following a loss, the MMT opiate group chose the likely small reward option significantly less frequently than controls and heroin users. Our results suggest that different opiates are associated with distinctive behavioral response...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: CHEOBS is a French multicenter, prospective, {{observational}} study that aimed to analyse the {{factors associated with}} adherence to treatment with peginterferon alfa- 2 b and ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C patients. The present analysis focuses on adherence to antiviral dual therapy, virological response, {{and quality of life}} (QoL) according to whether the patients were active drug users or under substitution treatment (ADU), <b>ex-drug</b> <b>users</b> (EDU), or non-drug users (NDU). Patients and methods: Between 2003 and 2006, 184 clinicians evaluated 2001 hepatitis C patients every 3 months during treatment and 6 months after the end of treatment. Among these patients, 141 were excluded from the analysis. The studied population included 244 ADU, 578 EDU and 1038 NDU. Good adherence was defined by> 80 % of the dose and duration of the antiviral dual therapy prescribed. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined by a negative PCR ≥ 12 weeks after the end of treatment. QoL was assessed using the SF- 36 questionnaire. Results: The patient profile in the EDU group was between that in the ADU and NDU groups for mean age, body mass index (BMI), liver fibrosis, level of education or debt difficult to manage, high consumption of alcohol, psychiatric disorders, or chronic diseases. The proportion of good adherents to dual therapy was similar in all three groups: NDU, 49. 4 %; EDU, 48. 6 %; ADU, 52. 2 % (p= 0. 7). The SVR rate was also similar: 49. 3 %, 50. 9 %, and 57. 8 %, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, is to {{investigate}} {{the details of the}} school life of adolescent drug users and factors that affect or interact, so as to form it. Qualitative study with semi-structured interviews of adolescents and parents who attended the treatment programs KETHEA STROFI and KETHEA PLEYSI. The material studied involved 30 adolescents (16 - 22 years old) and 27 parents (41 - 63 years old) and it was processed using the method of Grounded Theory Analysis. A population as a whole was revealed suffering from the phenomenon of school failure and high rates of school dropout. But teenagers attempt mainly most successfully to reconnect with the educational system via of the therapeutic framework and building on the educational services offered (counselling in education, attending the Transitional School). The general scenario that reflects the school path, describes a population that starts school, without any particular performance problems, but over time, behavioural problems are being developed during primary school. This population of adolescents, growing up in families, with many and varied problems and parents who are unable to handle them. The issue of school performance of children is a special area of strong conflict, which affects the school adjustment at the last classes of primary school. Transition from Elementary to High School marks the time when the teenager, experiencing personal problems (insecurity, need for recognition and validation, integration problems in the new school environment), associated with groups of other teenagers, usually older than them, with delinquent behaviour patterns and use of psychotropic substances. This search will lead them into conflict with the educational institution and the people who represent it. For a large group of teenagers, constant change of school environments, will lead to school dropout, accompanied by a rapid deterioration at all levels of life (health, substance use, delinquency, etc.) The inclusion of adolescents and their families in treatment programs and the use of their services, create conditions for the overall change in the level of values, attitudes and behaviours, related to education, creating conditions for education and school rehabilitation, even when the attempt is made in the same schools that the adolescents had dropped out from. It is important to discuss emerging issues, such as addressing major crises and family management problems, the pedagogical nature of secondary school and the management of student issues, the appearance and address of substance use issues in schools, developing prevention programs in school and successful educational strategies for the reintegration of the population of <b>ex-drug</b> <b>users.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Drug abuse {{has become}} a seious problem, not only in {{regional}} or national scope, but it {{has become a}} great concern in the international forum, because of its negative impact on all life dimensions of human being, such as health, social economics and mental conditions. In Indonesia, special attention of the government has been paid by implementing Law No. 22 / 1997 on Narcotic Law No. 5 / 1997 on Psychotropic, the aim which is it to carry out control on narcotic and psycotropic distribution for the benefit of health services. Any kind of drugs use without prior permission and supervision from a doctor or a phician will clearly constitute an offence against the las an it shall be punished. However, despite a heavy punishment threat imposed to the law offenders, the drug problem is always increasing. They are not afraid of a heavy penalty that mighty be sentenced to them. The writer thinks that there must be some problem happened in the implementation of these laws. The problem aspecially the illegal drug distribution in Semarang can not be eliminated. This research has objectives to reveal and analyze: how far the laws have been implemented, and how far the law enforces, police, attoneys, and judges have done their duties to enforce the laws, and also, how far the drug abusers, illegal trafficers and people in society or non-government organization (NGO) have carried out the laws in an attempt to eliminate the illegal drug trafficing in Semarang.
