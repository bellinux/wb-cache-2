25|$|CRISPR/Cas <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> {{techniques}} have many potential applications, including medicine and crop seed enhancement. The use of CRISPR/Cas9-gRNA complex for <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> was the AAAS's choice for breakthrough {{of the year}} in 2015.

25|$|CRISPR/Cas9 <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> {{is carried}} out with a Type II CRISPR system. When {{utilized}} for <b>genome</b> <b>editing,</b> this system includes Cas9, crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homology Directed Repair (HDR).|$|E
25|$|Transcription activator-like {{effector}} nucleases (TALEN) are restriction {{enzymes that}} can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain (a nuclease which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in gene editing or for <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> in situ, a technique known as <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> with engineered nucleases. Alongside zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN is a prominent tool {{in the field of}} <b>genome</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December, {{scientists}} of major world academies {{called for a}} moratorium on inheritable human <b>genome</b> <b>edits,</b> including those related to CRISPR-Cas9 technologies but that basic research including embryo gene editing should continue.|$|R
40|$|CRISPR/Cas 9 genome {{engineering}} strategies {{allow the}} directed {{modification of the}} Caenorhabditis elegans genome to introduce point mutations, generate knock-out mutants, and insert coding sequences for epitope or fluorescent tags. Three practical aspects, however, complicate such experiments. First, the efficiency and specificity of single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) cannot be reliably predicted. Second, the detection of animals carrying <b>genome</b> <b>edits</b> can be challenging {{in the absence of}} clearly visible or selectable phenotypes. Third, the sgRNA target site must be inactivated after editing to avoid further double-strand break events. We describe here a strategy that addresses these complications by transplanting the protospacer of a highly efficient sgRNA into a gene of interest to render it amenable to genome engineering. This sgRNA targeting the dpy- 10 gene generates <b>genome</b> <b>edits</b> at comparatively high frequency. We demonstrate that the transplanted protospacer is cleaved {{at the same time as}} the dpy- 10 gene. Our strategy generates scarless <b>genome</b> <b>edits</b> because it no longer requires the introduction of mutations in endogenous sgRNA target sites. Modified progeny can be easily identified in the F 1 generation, which drastically reduces the number of animals to be tested by PCR or phenotypic analysis. Using this strategy, we reliably generated precise deletion mutants, transcriptional reporters, and translational fusions with epitope tags and fluorescent reporter genes. In particular, we report here the first use of the new red fluorescent protein mScarlet in a multicellular organism. wrmScarlet, a C. elegans-optimized version, dramatically surpassed TagRFP-T by showing an eightfold increase in fluorescence in a direct comparison...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{planning}} for computing <b>genome</b> <b>edit</b> distances was suggested by Erdem and Tillier in 2005, but to date {{there has been}} no study of how well domain-independent planners are able to solve this problem. This paper reports on experi-ments with several PDDL formulations of the problem, using several state-of-the-art planners. The main observations are, first, that the problem formulation that is easiest for planners to deal with is not the obvious one, and, second, that plan quality – in particular consistent and assured plan quality – remains the biggest challenge...|$|R
25|$|Several {{variants}} of CRISPR/Cas9 allow gene activation or <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> with an external trigger such as light or small molecules. These include photoactivatable CRISPR systems developed by fusing light-responsive protein partners with an activator domain and a dCas9 for gene activation, or fusing similar light responsive domains with two constructs of split-Cas9, or by incorporating caged unnatural amino acids into Cas9, or by modifying the guide RNAs with photocleavable complements for <b>genome</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{autonomous}} {{philosophy of}} biology {{is represented by}} Guenther Witzany and his theory of biocommunication: Living nature is structured and organized by language and communication within and among cells, tissues, organs and organisms. This means that besides human language and communication every living entity is competent to use signs with which it can differentiate between self and non-self. The communicative competence serves for coordination of group behavior (tissues, organs, organisms). Biocommunication research is applied to all organismic kingdoms based on empirical data. Additionally the biocommunication method investigates nucleotide sequences as natural code which is structured according combinatorial, context-sensitive and content-specific rules. Natural <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> from a biocommunicative perspective consequently is investigated as competent agent-driven generation and integration of meaningful nucleotide sequences into pre-existing genomic content arrangements of host organisms. Such natural <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2015, {{scientists}} of major world academies {{called for a}} moratorium on inheritable human <b>genome</b> <b>edits</b> that would be passed on in pregnancies, including those related to CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, but supported continued basic research and gene editing that would not affect future generations. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify human embryos by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques on condition that the embryos were destroyed in seven days. In June 2016, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on their [...] "Recommendations for Responsible Conduct" [...] of gene drives.|$|R

25|$|In {{comparison}} to other <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> techniques TALEN {{falls in the}} middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike ZFNs, TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides {{than it is to}} create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets. On the other hand, CRISPR relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} {{specifically to}} other scar-free <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> techniques including the method published by Datsenko and Wanner, the no-SCAR method is less time-consuming when multiple mutations are desired. Two {{components of the}} method mediate this rapid mutation ability. First, the pCas9cr4 plasmid is retained in the cells after the first iteration thus preventing repetitive transfection of the plasmid into the cells. In instances where three genome modifications are desired, for example, {{this means that the}} no-SCAR method is able to mediate these mutations four days faster than the next fastest method. Second, the wild-type gene is never removed from the chromosome. This means that PCR screening is able to more quickly identify numerous mutants because essential wild-type genes can be targeted with ease.|$|E

50|$|Gene {{therapy is}} the genetic {{engineering}} of humans, generally by replacing defective genes with effective ones. Clinical research using {{somatic gene therapy}} has been conducted with several diseases, including X-linked SCID, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Parkinson's disease. In 2012, Glybera became the first gene therapy treatment to be approved for clinical use. Germline gene therapy would result in any change being inheritable, which has raised concerns within the scientific community. In 2015, CRISPR was used to edit the DNA of non-viable human embryos, leading scientists of major world academies to called for a moratorium on inheritable human <b>genome</b> <b>edits.</b> There are also concerns that the technology could be used not just for treatment, but for enhancement, modification or alteration of a human beings' appearance, adaptability, intelligence, character or behavior.

40|$|Crops of {{the near}} future will be <b>genome</b> <b>edited</b> via a {{technology}} called “Genome editing with engineered nucleases ” or GEEN, a technology that can add, remove or repair existing genes that might be not desirable such as genes that make crops susceptible to diseases, insects, drought, heat, cold or other biotic and abiotic stress factors. For decades, molecular biologists have been using restriction nucleases or restriction enzymes to cut DNA at or near DNA specific recognition sites in order to study the crops DNAs or to genetically engineer crops. Restriction enzymes naturally exist in bacteria, evolutionally developed to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses by selectively cleaving the viral DNA while the host DNA is protected by the methylase enzymes that block such cleavage in the host DNA. The GEEN technology mostly uses artificially engineered restriction nucleases that {{have been designed to}} make specific cleavage called double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in specific recognition sites of...|$|R
25|$|Methods {{to control}} <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> with small {{molecules}} include an allosteric Cas9, with no detectable background editing, that will activate binding and cleavage upon {{the addition of}} 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT), 4-HT responsive intein-linked Cas9s or a Cas9 that is 4-HT responsive when fused to four ERT2 domains. Intein-inducible split-Cas9 allows dimerization of Cas9 fragments and Rapamycin-inducible split-Cas9 system developed by fusing two constructs of split Cas9 with FRB and FKBP fragments. Furthermore, other studies have shown to induce transcription of Cas9 with a small molecule, doxycyline. Small molecules {{can also be used}} to improve Homology Directed Repair (HDR), often by inhibiting the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway. These systems allow conditional control of CRISPR activity for improved precision, efficiency and spatiotemporal control.|$|E
25|$|Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering (no-SCAR) is an editing {{method that}} {{is able to}} {{manipulate}} the Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. The system relies on recombineering whereby DNA sequences are combined and manipulated through homologous recombination. No-SCAR is able to manipulate the E. coli genome {{without the use of}} the chromosomal markers detailed in previous recombineering methods. Instead, in this method, the λ-Red recombination system facilitates donor DNA integration while Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA to counter-select against wild-type cells. Although λ-Red and Cas9 <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> are widely used technologies, the no-SCAR method is novel in combining the two functions; this technique is able to establish point mutations, gene deletions, and short sequence insertions in several genomic loci with increased efficiency and time sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} method for <b>genome</b> <b>editing</b> uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E
40|$|The author {{presents}} a review {{article on the}} book, Brave new world? Theology, ethics and the human <b>genome,</b> <b>edited</b> by Celia Deane-Drummond and published in 2003 by T&T Clark International in London. After a rather elaborate exposition, he appraises the collection of essays {{in terms of the}} dialogue between theology and the natural sciences. As an acid test, he assesses the challenge Kant, however, dealt with, namely to combine and to separate the right things. Kant pushed this to extremes and ended up with both solipsism and dualism. This article tackles the challenge differently and concludes that theology is an a posteriori science and that by means of différance, knowledge of the noumenon is indeed possible. The author therefore appreciates the different contributions in the book in this light. Deane-Drummond’s proposal that a virtue ethic should be complemented by certain biblical values is therefore viewed rather sceptically.

40|$|We {{isolated}} four W chromosome-derived {{bacterial artificial chromosome}} (W-BAC) clones from Bombyx mori BAC libraries by the polymerase {{chain reaction}} and used them as probes for {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) on chromosome preparations from B. mori females. All four W-BAC probes surprisingly highlighted the whole wild-type W sex chromosome and also identified the entire original W-chromosomal region in W chromosome-autosome translocation mutants. This is the first successful identification of a single chromosome by means of BAC-FISH in species with holokinetic chromosomes. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) by using female-derived genomic probes highlighted the W chromosome in a similar chromosome-painting manner. Besides the W, hybridization signals of W-BAC probes also occurred in telomeric and/or subtelomeric regions of the autosomes. These signals coincided well with those of female genomic probes except one additional GISH signal that was observed in a large heterochromatin block of one autosome pair. Our results support the opinion that the B. mori W chromosome accumulated transposable elements and other repetitive sequences that also occur, but scattered, elsewhere in the respective <b>genome.</b> <b>Edited</b> by: E.

For example primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with very poor prognosis that typically affects HIV infected individuals in advanced stages of immunodeficiency. Here {{we report on the}} dual anti-HIV and anti-PEL effect of targeting a single process common in both diseases. Inhibition of the exportin- 1 (XPO 1) mediated nuclear transport by clinical stage orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors (SINE) prevented the nuclear export of the late intron-containing HIV RNA species and consequently potently suppressed viral replication. In contrast, in CRISPR-Cas 9 <b>genome</b> <b>edited</b> cells expressing mutant C 528 S XPO 1, viral replication was unaffected upon treatment, clearly demonstrating the anti-XPO 1 mechanism of action. At the same time, SINE caused the nuclear accumulation of p 53 tumor suppressor protein as well as inhibition of NF-κB activity in PEL cells resulting in cell cycle arrest and effective apoptosis induction. In vivo, oral administration arrested PEL tumor growth in engrafted mice. Our findings provide strong rationale for inhibiting XPO 1 as an innovative strategy for the combined anti-retroviral and anti-neoplastic treatment of HIV and PEL and offer perspectives for the treatment of other AIDS-associated cancers and potentially other virus-related malignancies. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDNA viruses, retroviruses and hepadnaviruses, such as {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV), {{are vulnerable}} to genetic editing of single stranded DNA by host cell APOBEC 3 (A 3) cytidine deaminases. At least three A 3 genes are up regulated by interferon-alpha in human hepatocytes while ectopic expression of activation induced deaminase (AICDA), an A 3 paralog, has been noted {{in a variety of}} chronic inflammatory syndromes including hepatitis C virus infection. Yet virtually all studies of HBV editing have confined themselves to analyses of virions from culture supernatants or serum where the frequency of <b>edited</b> <b>genomes</b> is generally low (HBV>alcoholic cirrhosis. A 3 C and A 3 D were up regulated for all groups while the interferon inducible A 3 G was over expressed in virus associated cirrhosis, as was AICDA in approximately 50 % of these HBV/HCV samples. While AICDA can indeed edit HBV DNA ex vivo, A 3 G is the dominant deaminase in vivo with up to 35 % of HBV <b>genomes</b> being <b>edited.</b> Despite these highly deleterious mutant spectra, a small fraction of genomes survive and contribute to loss of HBeAg antigenemia and possibly HBsAg immune escape. In conclusion, the cytokine storm associated with chronic inflammatory responses to HBV and HCV clearly up regulates a number of A 3 genes with A 3 G clearly being a major restriction factor for HBV.

However, due to the widespread privacy concerns on revealing personal genomic data, the scope and scale of many novel use of <b>genome</b> <b>edit</b> distance are substantially limited. While the problem of private genomic edit distance has been studied by the research community for over a decade [5], the state-of-the-art solution [30] is far from even close to be applicable to real genome sequences. In this paper, we propose several private edit distance protocols that feature unprecedentedly high efficiency and precision. Our construction is a combination of a novel genomic edit distance ap-proximation algorithm and new construction of private set differ-ence size protocols. With the private edit distance based secure SPQ primitive, we propose GENSETS, a genome-wide, privacy-preserving similar patient query system.
