40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the damage that can occur in steam distribution systems due to high pressures generated by condensate being swept through pipework by high pressure steam. Two cases have been considered. The first situation is one where an isolated slug of water is propelled through a pipeline by high pressure gas and impacts against an obstruction, in this case an orifice plate. In the experimental tests compressed air was used to propel a slug of water through a 13 m long 50 mm diameter pipeline; impact pressures of up to 300 bar were generated. The second case considers the damage that is found to occur in a particular component of a steam system - a steam <b>float</b> <b>trap.</b> Damage was inflicted by slug impact and by pressures generated from water hammer in the main line. Although water slugs are often blamed for steam trap failures, the damage inflicted by this mechanism was inconsistent with that found in practice and it is concluded that they are not responsible. Water hammer in the main line could, however, be the cause of failure...|$|E

This study examined the selectivity of bottom and <b>floating</b> <b>traps</b> and the analysis of yield-per-recruit (YPR) and biomass-per-recruit (BPR) providing helpful insight to the management of the shrimp Plesionika narval. A total of 28, 262 specimens were sampled and the analysis of length at first capture returned higher values when using <b>floating</b> <b>traps</b> indicating that these traps are more selective, exerting less pressure on the resource. The YPR and BPR analysis showed that the stock is under exploited for the studied area and suggests that the use of <b>floating</b> <b>traps</b> in the commercial fisheries of P. narval is recommended, which will allow a higher maximum allowable limit of exploitation and greater yield.

40|$|International audienceFive Argo <b>floats</b> <b>trapped</b> in the Ona Basin, in the {{southern}} Drake Passage, provided unprecedented information on the water masses and the circulation present in all the seasons from March 2002 to April 2006. Their profiles recorded evidence of deep-penetrating eddies, interleaving of water masses, and branching of the Southern Front of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as it meets the Shackleton Fracture Zone. Ten-day mean-velocity estimates at the float parking depth (2000 db) often exceeded 15 cm s - 1, revealing {{the intensity of the}} mesoscale field. Satellite data showed that the trapping period of the floats corresponded to the presence of an anticyclonic meander of the polar front over a depression in the topography to the northwest of the Ona Basin.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1997 During May-June, 1995 and 1996, the outmigration of {{juvenile}} chum salmon (Oncorkynchus keta) and chinook salmon (O. tschazvytscha) was sampled with <b>floating</b> <b>traps</b> {{in the area}} of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, Chena River, Alaska. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was higher at night than day for chinook juveniles, but not for chum juveniles. CPUE of both species decreased as the season progressed, but usually increased during higher-discharge events. CPUE is standardized by time; discharge was monitored as a covariate but was not included in CPUE calculations. The Jolly-Seber family of models was used on recapture data of fin-dipped fish to obtain estimates of abundance and survival in 1996. Abundance estimates were 266, 104 chum salmon (95 % Cl 128, 031 - 404, 177) and 171, 952 chinook salmon (95 % Cl 146, 342 - 197, 561) during the May-June outmigration period.

40|$|Aquatic insect {{emergence}} is {{an important}} resource for terrestrial insectivores that rely on aquatic insects while raising young, or when terrestrial production is low. Emerging insects also transfer valuable high-energy lipids from phytoplankton to terrestrial consumers. The objectives of this project were to: (1) quantify insect emergence in two large-river systems that differed in primary productivity, and (2) determine the impacts of bighead and silver carp on the emergent insect community. <b>Floating</b> <b>traps</b> (surface area = 0. 25 m 2) were used to sample emerging adult insects, and were placed in study sites with and without Asian carp.

Sites with carp displayed the greatest insect flux; however, insect diversity was greatest at sites without carp, and lowest at the sites with carp. Emergent insect diversity was correlated {{with the presence of}} aquatic vegetation. Insect abundance was also linearly related to algal standing stock (measured as chlorophyll a). This suggests that primary productivity in large river systems {{have a positive impact on}} the magnitude of insect emergence, and that the diversity of insects increases with aquatic vegetation.

The elements determined include 13 trace metals and 8 major elements. The fluxes {{for most of the}} bioactive elements at 30 m varied markedly during different seasons and strongly co-varied with organic matter production, but the fluxes at 160 m were low and consistent under different seasons, showing that most of the elements were internally recycled in the surface water during productive seasons. Most of the bioactive trace metals in sinking particles were correlated with biogenic P, and their P-normalized quotas were also strongly associated with lithogenic Al. The ratios of metals to Al and P for most of the bioactive trace metals were significantly higher than the ratios in lithogenic particles and than intracellular quotas in plankton, respectively, indicating that the trace metals in the sinking particles were abiogenic, nonlithogenic, and adsorbed on biogenic particles.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{successfully}} monitored community-wide phenological patterns in seasonally flooded Amazonian várzea forests, where a prolonged annual flood pulse arguably generates the greatest degree of seasonality of any low-latitude ecosystem on Earth. We monitored the vegetative and reproductive plant phenology of várzea (VZ) floodplain and adjacent terra firme (TF) forests within two contiguous protected areas in western Brazilian Amazonia, using three complementary methods: monthly canopy observations of 1056 individuals (TF: 556, VZ: 500), twice monthly collections from 0. 5 -m 2 litterfall traps within two 100 -ha plots (1 TF, 1 VZ; 96 traps per plot), and monthly ground surveys of residual fruit-fall along transect-grids within each 100 -ha plot (12 km per plot). Surveys encompassed the entire annual flood cycle and employed a <b>floating</b> <b>trap</b> design {{to cope with}} fluctuating water levels. Phenology patterns were generally similar in both forest types. Leaffall peaked during the aquatic phase in várzea forest and the dry season in terra firme. Flowering typically followed leaffall and leaf flush, extending into {{the onset of the}} terrestrial phase and rainy season in várzea and terra firme, respectively. Abiotic seed dispersal modes were relatively more prevalent in várzea than terra firme; the main contrast in fruiting seasonality was more likely a result of differences in community composition and relative abundance of seed dispersal modes than differences within individual genera.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis was motivated {{by the desire to}} understand the flow field within a new digital microfluidic device currently under development. This required an investigation of the dynamics of a droplet migrating along the surface of another fluid due to interfacial surface tension gradients. The quantitative analysis of the flow field {{presented in this}} thesis provides the first known solution for the velocity field in a migrating droplet confined to an interface. 	The first step towards gaining insight into the flow field was accomplished by using the method of reflections to obtain an analytical model for a submerged droplet migrating near a free surface. The submerged droplet model enabled the analysis of the velocity field and droplet migration speed and their dependence on the fluid properties. In general, the migration velocity of a submerged droplet was found to differ dramatically from the classic problem of thermocapillary migration in an unbounded substrate. 	A boundary-collocation scheme was developed to determine the flow field and migration velocity of a droplet <b>floating</b> <b>trapped</b> at the air-substrate interface. The numerical method was found to produce accurate solutions for the velocity and temperature fields for nearly all parameters. This numerical scheme was used to judge the accuracy of the flow field obtained by the submerged droplet model. In particular, the model was tested using parameter values taken from a digital microfluidic device. It was determined that the submerged droplet model captured most of the flow structure within the microfluidic droplet. However, for a slightly different choice of parameters, agreement between the two methods was lost. In this case, the numerical scheme was used to uncover novel flow structures. Ph. D.

Estimates were made of pollen deposited per unit area per unit time from the air (in traps on land and floating inside the tubes), and within the lake (at the mud surface and in traps submerged {{both inside and outside}} the tubes to catch seston). Samples from inflows were also analysed for pollen. Results indicated that: (i) Airborne pollen deposition varied in intensity, (a) seasonally, and (b) between years, with the magnitude of annual pollen production. (ii) <b>Floating</b> <b>traps</b> underestimated (by c. X 2) the actual intensity of pollen deposition on the water. (iii) Most pollen disseminated was deposited near the parent plants. Hence terrestrial surfaces form a reservoir from which pollen is recruited by surface runoff. (iv) Catches in the submerged traps varied seasonally with the relative recruitment of (a) fresh airborne pollen, and (b) pollen resuspended from the sediment surface by turbulence. (v) Delivery of streamborne pollen to the lake varied non-seasonally with rainfall/stream discharge. (vi) Ratios for pollen: seston trapped varied seasonally with plankton production, (vii) Pollen taxa were not dispersed with equal efficiency in air: poorly-dispersed taxa were recruited mainly to the lake by runoff.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what insect species occurred in waste water facilities at Corvallis, Oregon, and to correlate these species with the chemical, physical, and biological features common to these facilities. Data collected on a routine basis included dissolved oxygen, temperature, algal density, and insect population samples. Most of this work was conducted during L 963 - 64 at an experimental waste water lagoon that received municipal sewage from Corvallis. Observations were also made at an agricultural waste water lagoon that received wastes from a hog farm located at Oregon State University. Insect larvae were collected with an aquatic dip net and a six inch square Eckman dredge. Adults were collected in a <b>floating</b> <b>trap.</b> Environmental conditions for insects occurring in the experimental waste water lagoon fluctuated rapidly at times. This was due to shock loadings of influent containing high amounts of biochemical oxidation demand. When these variations in environmental conditions are considered, any insect population occurring in the lagoon must be either tolerant to these fluctuations, seasonal residents, or transitory residents. All the insect species confined their activities to the peripheral portions of the lagoon. Eight species of the Hemiptera were recovered; and of these Notonectidae and Corixidae were the most numerous. Dytiscidae and Hydrophilidae were the most important Coleoptera. Representatives of Diptera were the most abundant species. Larval Culicidae were seasonally abundant. Psychodidae and Syrphidae were infrequent in occurrence. The larval populations of the family Chironomidae were the most dominant feature of the lagoon. Procladius sp. and Chironomus sp. were permanent residents and were limited in their microdistribution to an area 0. 6 feet to 2. 6 feet deep and two to seven feet from the shore. No insects were recovered from the central areas of the Lagoon. The main chemical and physical factors affecting the insect populations in the lagoon are, influent quality and quantity, wave action, bottom sediments, and climatic conditions. Among the biological mechanisms affecting the insect populations are algal photosynthesis, peripheral vegetation, and insect predator-prey relationships...|$|R

Sinking fluxes of total mass, POC, PIC, PN, 234 Th, 210 Pb, and 210 Po measured at the euphotic depth were low in summer-fall and high in winter-spring, reflecting the seasonal variability of biological pumping. Excluding the suspiciously low primary productivity data point in July 2007, a relatively high e-ratio of 0. 28 – 0. 69 was estimated by {{the ratio of the}} POC flux at the euphotic depth and the integrated primary productivity.
