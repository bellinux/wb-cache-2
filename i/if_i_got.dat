500|$|Ono {{was pleased}} that Jackson had {{acquired}} Northern Songs and called it a [...] "blessing". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, [...] "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring." [...] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) was {{established}} by Louis B. Mayer, originator of Louis B. Mayer Pictures Corporation, which then would be joined into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Mayer's purpose in creating the award was to unite the five branches of the film industry, including actors, directors, producers, technicians, and writers. Mayer commented {{on the creation of}} the awards [...] "I found {{that the best way to}} handle [...] was to hang medals all over them ... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them cups and awards they'd kill them to produce what I wanted. That's why the Academy Award was created". Mayer asked Cedric Gibbons, art director of MGM, to design an Academy Award trophy. Nominees were notified through a telegram in February 1928. In August 1928, Mayer contacted the Academy Central Board of Judges to decide winners. However, according to the American director King Vidor, the voting for the Academy Award for Best Picture was in the hands of the AMPAS founders Douglas Fairbanks, Sid Grauman, Mayer, Mary Pickford, and Joseph Schenck.|$|E

500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race. During a February 18 taping of Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a Philadelphia-area local news show, host Larry Kane asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, [...] "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan to take it. In subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E
500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Treviño {{praised the}} {{subsequent}} changes to her costume {{in order to}} reduce its sexuality, saying that [...] "it is much more sensible, because she's still an attractive person but then you get away from that titillation stuff which I think is so demeaning not only to the audience, but it's kinda of demeaning to what Star Trek is about." [...] The later versions of her costumes still required 20 minutes to get into before filming could start, but Ryan said they were much more forgiving, [...] "In the silver costume, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> goosebumps, you could see them. The brown costume is a thicker, stronger fabric. It's not quite so clingy, so the waist doesn't have to be cinched in." [...] That version of the costume also removed the vertical bones of the corset, which allowed Ryan to have greater flexibility while wearing it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Richard James, a naval {{mechanical}} engineer {{stationed at the}} William Cramp and Sons shipyards in Philadelphia, was developing springs that could support and stabilize sensitive instruments aboard ships in rough seas. James accidentally knocked one of the springs from a shelf, {{and watched as the}} spring [...] "stepped" [...] in a series of arcs to a stack of books, to a tabletop, and to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. James's wife Betty later recalled, [...] "He came home and said, 'I think <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the right property of steel and the right tension; I could make it walk.'" [...] James experimented with different types of steel wire over the next year, and finally found a spring that would walk. [...] Betty was dubious at first, but changed her mind after the toy was fine-tuned and neighborhood children expressed an excited interest in it. She dubbed the toy Slinky (meaning [...] "sleek and graceful"), after finding the word in a dictionary, and deciding that the word aptly described the sound of a metal spring expanding and collapsing.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

2500|$|He {{has tried}} the mixture between flamenco and [...] {{classical}} music in works like Fantasía de cante jondo para voz y orquesta (Cante jondo Fantasy for voice and orchestra, together with pianist Antonio Robledo, guitarists Juan Habichuela and Gerardo Núñez and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Luis Izquierdo, 1986) or with Allegro Soleá, which he presented at Seville's Flamenco Biennal in 1990. Along {{the lines of}} the mixture of flamenco with other types of music, he collaborated in the show Macama Jonda by José Heredia Maya, together with the Tetuan Andalusian Orchestra and Abdessadeq Cheqara, or with the Bulgarian Voices choir Angelite. In Morente's aforementioned recording Omega, [...] he mixed flamenco singing with punk rock, music by Leonard Cohen, and lyrics by Federico García Lorca. In the show África-Cuba-Cai he mixed flamenco with music from Senegal, and Cuba (Cai is the way Cádiz is pronounced in Andalusian Spanish). The show also underlines the historic links between Cuban and flamenco music: [...] "That's always been close to flamenco, since way back, because the ships in Cádiz went to Cuba, some came and others stayed over there, we've always had that." [...] It is difficult to think of any kind of music which has not interested Morente. After one of his concerts with Cheqara Orkesta of Tetuan, he declared: [...] "…if I had to put out a CD for every culture I mixed with I'd be putting out about 7 or 8 CDs a year. It wouldn't be bad – <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> paid for it by the record company then I could build myself a home." ...|$|E
