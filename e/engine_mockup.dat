40|$|International audienceExperiments {{are carried}} out with {{substitution}} fluids (air and water), without heat and mass transfer on a rocket <b>engine</b> <b>mockup.</b> The work presented here intends to reproduce the experimental results using incompressible twophase flow simulations. The geometry used {{is representative of the}} experimental mockupcomposed of a feeding pipe, a dome, and a number of injectors. The objective of the paper is to adapt a Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model approach to simulate the filling of a dome and to test its ability to reproduce some experimental evidences. The main difficulties to be faced are the fast transients in a complex geometry, including in particular the valve opening sequence, and the drastic evolution of the two-phase flow regime as the flow evolves from gas only to liquid only. An important work has been conducted to obtain the proper inlet conditions to be imposed in the code in coherence with the experiments. The influences of the turbulence modeling and the interfacial momentum transfer modeling are also studied. The former has no macroscopic or local effect on the mass flow rate of water, the mass of water in the dome, and the dome pressure. The drag model, however, has a major impact on the results as much globally as locally. The Simmer-like drag model is preferred in comparison to the Large Interface Model, due to a better agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, it has to be highlighted that the Simmer-like model is very sensitive to the inclusion diameter...|$|E

40|$|A haptic virtual {{borescope}} {{is developed}} {{for the purpose of}} air-craft engine inspection training, similar in spirit to borescope train-ers intended for use in gas turbine maintenance training schools. Such devices consist of <b>engine</b> section <b>mockups</b> for use with a real borescope. Our approach instead simulates engine sections in vir-tual reality, replacing the need for physical mockups. We model the engine casing as a “black box ” where a simulated borescope tip is inserted (in practice a real borescope is used to provide tactile veridicality of the probe’s braided sheath but the camera at its tip is not used). The probe’s translational movement is mapped to the vir-tual camera’s. The graphical engine representation can conceivably generalize to any engine section that can be modeled graphically. Since the interior chamber of the “black box ” casing is empty, the critical component of our simulator is correct borescope tip navi-gation as well as force feedback response based on a mathematical model of collision detection of the tip in the computer generated environment. Haptic response is thought to be a key component of the sim-ulator as it provides non-visual tactile awareness of the borescope tip within the engine under inspection and, more importantly, its contact with engine surfaces. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we design a novel motor-powered clamp that provides collision re-sponse to collision of the camera detected in virtual space. Second, we attempt to isolate the effect of the system’s tactile response and provide empirical evaluation of its utility. In line with previous results, our empirical analysis reveals a trend toward a benefit in performance (speed), but suggests that the provision of haptic feed-back, while preferred over a solely visual interface, may be per-ceived as extraneous in a visually-dominated discrimination task...|$|R
