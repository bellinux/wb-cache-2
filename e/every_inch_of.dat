In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only had}} the 35th and 38th Divisions been gutted in the {{fighting}} early in 1915, they were undergoing a change in command. The previous commander for the Iraq Area Command, Colonel Süleyman Askeri Bey, after the defeats of Qurna and Shaiba, had killed himself while recuperating from wounds. His successor was Colonel Nureddin. A veteran of the Balkan Wars, Nureddin was charged by Envers Pasha with defending <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> the Baghdad vilayet with an eye towards to recapturing Basra.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty-two days, the four conspirators fled {{through the small}} streets and little holes that they could find, trying to escape from Guatemala City, but the {{government}} surrounded the city and slowly tightened the perimeter while combing <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> terrain. The conspirators' families were incarcerated and prosecuted. Others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they attempted to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when someone informed on them. The Romaña brothers remained imprisoned until their death. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped the country on a bicycle. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to {{the house where the}} Avila Echeverría brothers and his friends were hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and begged him to pass them on to their relatives.|$|E

500|$|Although Kennedy was not {{a gifted}} skater, he {{compensated}} with a fierce determination and tireless hard work. Among modern era players his style of play {{has been compared to}} Bobby Clarke and Jarome Iginla. Line-mate Howie Meeker said that while he was a much better skater than Kennedy, [...] Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's coaching style of emphasizing defense, positional hockey and physical play. He brought to the Leafs a classy, humble leadership and the knack for scoring goals when they were most needed. He fought for <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> ice and was difficult to separate from the puck.

Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a [...] "Rubik's Cube" [...] style of modeling. He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts. One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed. Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.|$|E
500|$|Tool was {{described}} by Patrick Donovan of The Age as [...] "the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions." [...] Tool has gained critical praise from the International Herald Tribunes C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, AllMusic refers to them as [...] "grinding, post-Jane's Addiction heavy metal", and The New York Times sees similarities to [...] "Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes". Their 2001 work Lateralus was compared by Allmusic to Pink Floyd's Meddle (1971), but thirty years later and altered by [...] "Tool's impulse to cram <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread". Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993 and 1996, {{as well as in}} 2006, after the term came into popularity.|$|E

500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make."

[...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E
500|$|Buono chose {{black and}} red for the rink's new color palette. Red was used for its {{intensity}} and energy, and black was utilized because the rink would appear larger. Additionally, usage of black would contrast more boldly with the red colors. The ceiling above the rink was removed for lighting purposes. The rink floor was also refinished with darker colors to provide better light reflection. Rigging for the lights became an artistic challenge for Buono. Working with the art department, the rigging electrics and the rigging grips, he designed a wagon wheel effect that moved with {{the motion of the}} skating and allowed the lights to be programmed, aesthetically lighting both ends of the rink and capturing the action of the skating sequences. The skate rental section, arcade and snack bar were redesigned at the rink as well, so that the areas besides the skating floor wouldn't feel monotonous. “We did <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> that rink,” said Buono. “The carpet on the walls, painting the ceiling, putting in the lights, painting the snack bar, changing the color of the tables. We used a lot of neon and bold bright colors.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{stage for}} the tour was {{described}} by Brian Levine, senior project manager from Tait Towers, as [...] "a game-changer for what can be achieved in a stadium touring environment. The entire collaboration from scenic, to structure, to mechanics was custom-made to create an epic experience for both Beyoncé and her fans". Designed by Es Devlin and engineered and built collaboratively by Stageco and Tait Towers, the tour's stage features a centrepiece of a revolving 60 foot tall box, made with video screen walls. Known as the 'Monolith', Devlin spoke on the box stating of [...] "wanting {{this to be the}} tallest object in the stadium, a piece of kinetic stadium architecture the equivalent of a seven-story, revolving LED building". Devlin also commented the box was perceived as [...] "a giant 3D billboard, a huge LED armor within which Beyoncé is revealed as an all-too-human-scale, real-life figure" [...] and noted that Beyoncé was heavily involved in the creative process of <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> stages design. The rotations of the box were said to represent a new chapter of the show, in a similar chapter line to that of Lemonade. The box takes approximately 4 minutes to achieve one rotation.|$|E
500|$|California Chrome had {{a tumultuous}} four-year-old season. The horse began 2015 at Santa Anita in the San Antonio Stakes on February 7, a return matchup with Shared Belief, whose traffic {{problems}} in the Classic prevented a true match against California Chrome. Art Sherman and Shared Belief's trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, were longtime friends and rivals from the Northern California racing circuit, and each anticipated the rivalry between their two horses. Sherman said, [...] "I just want both of us {{to be at the}} head of the stretch with no excuses and then it's who gets to the wire first." [...] Shared Belief went off as the favorite, and although California Chrome took the lead by the [...] pole, Shared Belief edged him in the final sixteenth and won, with California Chrome second by a length and a half. [...] California Chrome next shipped to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai World Cup on March 28, where he needed to run at night, under artificial lighting, and without Lasix. He went off as the favorite but finished second to the Irish-bred longshot Prince Bishop, owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum of Godolphin Racing. Sherman noted that his horse ran wide on the turns but said, [...] "He tried <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> the way. There's nothing wrong with finishing second in this type of a race." ...|$|E

[...] The winning distance was the narrowest since the [...] "dead heat" [...] result of the 1877 Race. [...] It was Cambridge's third consecutive victory and took the overall record in the event to 51–43 in their favour. [...] The rowing correspondent for The Manchester Guardian suggested that this was a race that [...] "will never be forgotten", while the correspondent for The Times claimed that [...] "1949 must go down in Boat Race history as having provided one of the epic struggles of all time." [...] G. I. F. Thomson, writing in The Observer, stated that [...] "heroic determination on both sides ... produced perhaps the most exciting Boat Race of all time." ...|$|E
