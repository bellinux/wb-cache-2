5|$|The Florida Constitution of 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the <b>first</b> <b>Tuesday</b> after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained.|$|E
