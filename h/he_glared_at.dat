2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Coleman was fighting extradition to New Jersey. A warrant was issued by New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, and Manhattan prosecutors decided to drop a 1997 charge against him for allegedly having a small knife. Coleman later appeared in State Superior Court where he had to face Moore's mother and her sister. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them as he was led {{out of the courtroom}} in shackles. The Superior Court Judge, Sheila Venable, imposed a $2 million cash bail against him. [...] Coleman was extradited to New Jersey to face trial in October 2006.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{too much}} to hope for that Alec Bedser would dismiss Arthur Morris cheaply {{for the third time in}} a row, but he did in his second over and the Australian vice-captain was taken by Len Hutton in the slips for 2. Neil Harvey (42) came in at 6/1 and Australia were 67/1 at lunch despite the bowling of Bedser (who bowled {{unchanged}} throughout the morning) and Bailey and surprisingly good English fielding. Hassett even apologised to Brown as the ball was constantly fell just short of the slips, or flew over their heads as Harvey rode his luck. After lunch Bedser tickled Harvey's edge with a ball that Godfrey Evans snapped up instinctively, but had he missed few would have realised was a chance. The big bowler then held onto Ken Archer (26) in the slips by throwing himself to the ground and taking the ball in his outstretched right hand and Australia were 89/3. Keith Miller, whose matinée idol looks greatly affected his teenager fans, made 18, but his potential boundaries were stymied by Cyril Washbrook in the covers and Reg Simpson on the boundary-fence and he was trapped lbw by Freddie Brown (1/28) to bring Australia down to 93/4 on a good pitch on a perfect sunny day. Lindsay Hassett played a careful captain's innings of 52, adding 84 in an hour and a half with Sam Loxton (32). Brian Close was a short-leg to Hassett and kept on edging closer until he was almost face-to-face. He was brought on to rest Bedser and Bailey before the new ball was taken and Loxton was given [...] "not out" [...] when he appeared to give Hutton a straightforward catch in the gully. Soon after Loxton was out to a catch by Evans off Close when he didn't make contact and <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the umpire; [...] "Tha' were lucky once, Sam" [...] said Hutton [...] "so don't grouse" [...] and Australia were 177/5, which soon became 177/6 when Bedser yorked Hassett while loosening up with the old ball. The new ball was taken and Bedser (4/37) and Bailey (4/40) promptly cleared up the tail for 17 runs and Australia were all out for 194 at stumps.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Kipps, {{his face}} flushed deep, his sunken eyes glowing with passion, and then {{suddenly}} he changed altogether.|$|E

60|$|The bully {{dropped back}} {{and his face}} fell. He put his money back into his pocket. Then <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> savagely <b>at</b> Dave.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hoopdriver {{temporarily}} {{lost his}} thread. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> malignantly <b>at</b> {{the little man}} with the beard, and tried to recover his discourse. A pause.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silence, Sorceress," [...] {{shouted the}} Abbot. [...] "Get thee behind me, Satan. I know {{you and your}} familiars," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> the Prioress.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> {{me like a}} basilisk. “And {{why have}} I been met like this?” he enquired {{with an air of}} being {{prepared}} to hear a lie.|$|E
60|$|When Nat got up he was {{thoroughly}} angry. He had hired the roughs {{to help him}} and now they had deserted the cause. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Dave.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was goin' to {{hold him}} up," [...] said Mull. <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> {{fiercely}} <b>at</b> Neale, wrenched his hand free, and with his comrades disappeared in the crowd.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> stood <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> {{them for}} a few moments, with his hands tightly clenched; then, without uttering another word, he turned round and rushed from the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead?" [...] {{returned}} Ham Ludd. [...] "Do I {{look like}} I was dead?" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> savagely <b>at</b> Ricks. [...] "I ain't dead, {{not by a}} jugful!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{leaned forward}} till his white locks almost seemed {{to mingle with}} the thin flame, through which <b>he</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> me with eyes that were fiercer than the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't say {{anything}} about that. But 'tain't enough." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> me. [...] "Holtzmann said he'd pay me a hundred dollars. Yes, sir, ten {{times as much as}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> {{her for a}} moment, then hastened {{after his}} hat which had bounded away to some distance. He came back looking at her face, which was very white.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} a word of it!" [...] cried the irate instructor. [...] "How many of you threw at me?" [...] <b>he</b> questioned, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> the crowd.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so {{for both}} our sakes," [...] <b>he</b> answered, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> him, [...] "for if not, you or I, or {{the two of}} us, will never see another." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them, {{from under}} his bald, {{wrinkled}} forehead. Josephine glanced round. She had become a dusky white colour. She was afraid of him, and she disliked him intensely nowadays.|$|E
