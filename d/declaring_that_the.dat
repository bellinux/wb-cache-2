5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army.

5|$|In the 1970s the {{resident}} of No 22, Miss Amabel Wellesley-Colley, painted {{her front door}} yellow instead of the traditional white. Bath City Council issued a notice insisting it should be repainted.

Other proposals for alteration and development including floodlighting and a swimming pool have been defeated.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) {{made the}} {{controversial}} announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest {{building in the}} United States at 1,776 feet, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mast {{on top of the}} building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture. By the same reasoning, the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren, Juan Duarte {{had been}} her sole means of support. Biographer John Barnes writes that after this abandonment, all Duarte left to the family was a {{document}} <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> children were his, thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname. Soon after, Juana moved her children to a one-room apartment in Junín. To pay the rent on their single-roomed home, mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{challenged}} {{this decision}} splitting their working arrangements, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> division of its activities between three states {{was against the}} treaties and the natural prerogatives of a Parliament elected by direct universal suffrage, claiming {{the right to decide}} its own workings to its own efficiency. In response, leaders annexed the decision to the Treaty of Amsterdam, including it in the treaties.|$|E
5|$|The USAF F-111A and Navy F-111B {{variants}} {{used the}} same airframe structural components and TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured side-by-side crew seating in an escape capsule, {{as required by the}} Navy. Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy. The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E

5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} Holocaust denial, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for world domination. In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E
5|$|Welsh raids at the {{beginning}} of Stephen's reign had driven Bethune's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester. The land the canons were settled on had belonged to the diocese, and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter, led by their dean, Ralph. Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure an order from Innocent II <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chapter obey their bishop.|$|E
5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, a publisher attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

Basil of Ancyra, Eustathius of Sebaste, and their party <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Son was of similar substance to the Father, as in the majority decision at Seleucia, a position known as homoiousia. Maris of Chalcedon, Eudoxius of Antioch, and the deacons Aëtius and Eunomius <b>declared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Son was of a dissimilar substance from the Father, a position known as anomoeanism or heteroousia.|$|R

5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E
5|$|Jaime Lannister and Bronn {{lead the}} Lannister army to Riverrun, where Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers attempt to coerce the Blackfish into {{surrendering}} the castle {{by threatening to}} execute Edmure Tully. The Blackfish calls their bluff and refuses to surrender. Disgusted with the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege, orders Edmure to be bathed and fed, and attempts to parley with the Blackfish, warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys {{if they do not}} surrender the castle. The Blackfish is not intimidated by Jaime's threats and dares him to try and seize the castle, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tullys have enough provisions stockpiled to outlast a Lannister siege.|$|E

5|$|On the {{diplomatic}} front, the ministers of foreign nations, {{gathered in the}} open harbor of Hyōgo (present day Kobe) in early February, issued a declaration according to which the Shogunate was still considered the only rightful government in Japan, giving hope to Tokugawa Yoshinobu that foreign nations (especially France) might consider an intervention in his favour. A few days later however an Imperial delegation visited the ministers <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Shogunate was abolished, that harbours would be open in accordance with International treaties, and that foreigners would be protected. The ministers finally decided to recognize the new government.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's charges by <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} concerned {{who should}} invest a new bishop {{with his staff}} and ring: traditionally, this had been {{carried out by the}} king in a symbolic demonstration of royal power, but Pope Urban II had condemned this practice in 1099, arguing that only the papacy could carry out this task, and <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clergy should not give homage to their local temporal rulers. Anselm returned to England from exile in 1100 having heard Urban's pronouncement, and informed Henry that he would be complying with the Pope's wishes. Henry was in a difficult position. On one hand, the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.|$|E

5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> garland of {{currency notes}} was made from money through corrupt means and not from donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{south of}} Palau, the system's {{circulation}} became more broad and its convection became less organized, despite decreased wind shear. Early on November12, the depression made landfall on Mindanao in Davao Oriental province. Shortly thereafter, PAGASA discontinued advisories on Zoraida, <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> depression degenerated into a low pressure area. By contrast, the JMA continued monitoring the depression {{as it moved}} through the Philippines and into the Sulu Sea. On November13, the center crossed over Palawan island into the South China Sea. At 1200UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Podul about 275km (170mi) east of the Vietnam coast. Around the same time, the JTWC began issuing warnings on {{the system as a}} tropical depression 32W, noting that convection had rapidly increased over the circulation. The agency also mentioned the continued presence of wind shear, although warm water temperatures and moderate outflow were expected to allow intensification. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 65km/h (40mph), the JTWC only estimated tropical depression-force 1minute winds of 45km/h (30mph).|$|E
5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle of Fallujah. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 <b>declaring</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> province would be lost without a significant additional commitment of troops.|$|E
