5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded <b>eight</b> <b>million.</b> In {{common with}} other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, {{and like most}} of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.|$|E

5|$|According to Billboard, it is {{the second-best}} selling album of the 2000s decade in the United States. With over <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> copies sold in 2004, the album {{was viewed as a}} sign of {{recovering}} album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004.

5|$|After {{experimenting with}} porting the {{original}} The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, the Flagship team, supervised by Yoshiki Okamoto, began developing three interconnected Zelda games {{that could be}} played in any order. The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game. Both Seasons and Ages were a critical success, and together sold <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> units. Critics complimented the gameplay, colorful designs and graphic quality, but criticized the inconsistent sound quality.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set {{its first}} {{production}} shipment {{for the games}} in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event {{as an excuse to}} limit shipment and keep the demand high.|$|E

5|$|Bedtime Stories {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised the album's candid lyrics and production, {{and it was}} nominated for Best Pop Album at the 38th Grammy Awards.

Bedtime Stories has sold an estimated <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Despite low {{expectations}} among the gaming media and an unsuccessful showing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta in 1997, GoldenEye 007 {{turned out to}} be both a critical and a commercial success. It received very high critical praise and sold more than <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> units worldwide, making it the third best selling Nintendo 64 game, behind Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64. According to a paper published on the website of the Entertainment Software Association, the game grossed $250 million worldwide.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye 007 was {{developed}} {{over a period}} of {{two and a half years}} by an inexperienced team. It was originally conceived as an on-rails shooter inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, before being redesigned as a free-roaming shooter.

However, Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game, and lost his starting position to Rosevelt Colvin.

5000|$|The Japanese {{thought of}} eight (ya) as a holy {{number in the}} ancient times. The reason is less well understood, but {{it is thought that}} it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as manyfold (Yae Hatae) (literally, eightfold and twentyfold), many clouds (Yakumo) (literally, <b>eight</b> clouds), <b>{{millions}}</b> and millions of Gods (Yaoyorozu no Kami) (literally, <b>eight</b> <b>millions</b> of Gods), etc. It is also guessed that the ancient Japanese gave importance to pairs, so some researchers guess twice as four (yo), which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north, south, east, and west) might be considered a very holy number.|$|R

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the first episodes was negative, with many reviewers not liking the characters and finding the comedy drama format unusual. As the series progressed, critics' opinions became more positive; the production values rated highly and the fantasy scenes, which became a hallmark of Cold Feet, were well received. An average of <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> viewers watched the series each week. The following year it won awards from the Royal Television Society, the Broadcasting Press Guild and the British Comedy Awards. It was also nominated for the Rose d'Or and a Banff Rockie Award. All six episodes have been released on VHS, DVD and internet media formats.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of <b>eight</b> <b>million</b> sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was {{aware of the fact that}} it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated.

It won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies, {{making it one of the}} most awarded games in history, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time.|$|E
5000|$|Victor Hugo {{used this}} phrase in 1852.

60|$|But {{that is not}} {{the only}} vindication of free-trade finance which is at hand. How have foreign {{countries}} stood the late depression in trade? The shortfall of the revenue from the estimates in this country was last year less than two millions, in Germany it was <b>eight</b> <b>millions,</b> and in the United States over nineteen millions. Let the House see what fair-weather friends these protectionist duties are. In times of depression they shrink. In times of war they may fail utterly. When they are wanted, they dwindle, when they are wanted most urgently, they fade and die away altogether.|$|R

With about <b>eight</b> <b>millions</b> of expected top pairs and three millions of single top events produced per year in the low luminosity runs, and with a low level of backgrounds, the LHC will open a new opportunity for precision measurements of the top quark properties and for exotic topology searches involving top quarks. As the ATLAS discovery potential on new physics with top quark is being assessed with many analyses, this article focuses on two particular topics: heavy neutral resonances and charged Higgs boson searches with top quarks. The analyses and the ATLAS expectations are described...|$|R
