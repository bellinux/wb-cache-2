Moreover, it is an area with significant local anthropogenic emissions due to the industrial area of Porto Marghera, the urban centres, and the glass factories and with emissions by ships traffic within the Lagoon. Furthermore, since 2005, the Lagoon has also {{been affected by the}} construction of the MOSE (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico—Electromechanical Experimental Module) mobile dams, as a barrier against the high tide. This work presents and discusses the results from chemical analyses of bulk depositions, carried out in different sites of the Venice Lagoon. <b>Fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> were also statistically analysed on PCA with the aim of investigating the spatial variability of depositions and their correlation with precipitations. Fluxes of inorganic pollutants depend differently on precipitations, while organic compounds show a more seasonal trend. The statistical analysis showed that the site in the northern Lagoon has lower and almost homogeneous <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> while the other sites registered more variable concentrations.

40|$|Gaussian {{dispersion}} {{models are}} widely used to simulate the concentrations and deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> emitted by source areas. Very often, the calculation time limits the number of sources and receptors and the geometry of the sources must be simple and without holes. This paper presents CAREA, a new GIS-based Gaussian model for complex source areas. CAREA was coded in the Python language, and is largely based on a simplified formulation of the very popular and recognized AERMOD model. The model allows users to define in a GIS environment thousands of gridded or scattered receptors and thousands of complex sources with hundreds of vertices and holes. CAREA computes ground level, or near ground level, concentrations and dry deposition <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The input/output and the runs of the model can be completely managed in GIS environment (e. g. inside a GIS project). The paper presents the CAREA formulation and its applications to very complex test cases. The tests shows that the processing time are satisfactory and that the definition of sources and receptors and the output retrieval are quite easy in a GIS environment. CAREA and AERMOD are compared using simple and reproducible test cases. The comparison shows that CAREA satisfactorily reproduces AERMOD simulations and is considerably faster than AERMOD...|$|E

Based on the flux-gradient theory and a division of urban volume in UCL (Urban Canopy Layer) and UBL (Urban Boundary Layer) an iterative procedure has been adopted for the pollutant flux estimation with urban-sensible heat and surface roughness as the basic input. The method {{has been applied to}} a range of possible urban characteristics known from existing literature. It came out that the influence of surface roughness upon pollutant turbulent vertical fluxes predominated in all stabilities and also that it was rather insensitive of UCL height.

40|$|Aquatic sediments are the {{ultimate}} sink of wastes dispersed in freshwater and soil. They are therefore {{a useful tool for}} investigating polluted ecosystems. Lagoon environments are very difficult to study due to their unstable morphology. Under these circumstances, even an excellent environmental investigation of a restricted lagoon area would still be inadequate to appreciate the characteristics of the entire system. The Venice lagoon is a very complex ecosystem whose morphology is complicated further by extensive anthropic intervention. A good environmental representation of the area was obtained with a preliminary radiochemical survey of airborne radionuclides, a unique tool in evaluating the homogeneity of the entire sedimentary system.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{ventilation}} of the atmospheric boundary layer is {{weak in the}} absence of fronts, but is this always true? In this paper we investigate the processes responsible for ventilation of the atmospheric boundary layer during a nonfrontal day that occurred on 9 May 2005 using the UK Met Office Unified Model. Pollution sources are represented by the constant emission of a passive tracer everywhere over land. The ventilation processes observed include shallow convection, turbulent mixing followed by large-scale ascent, a sea breeze circulation and coastal outflow. Vertical distributions of tracer are validated qualitatively with AMPEP (Aircraft Measurement of chemical Processing Export <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pollutants</b> over the UK) CO aircraft measurements and are shown to agree impressively well. Budget calculations of tracers are performed {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of these ventilation processes. Coastal outflow and the sea breeze circulation were found to ventilate 26 % of the boundary layer tracer by sunset of which 2 % was above 2 km. A combination of coastal outflow, the sea breeze circulation, turbulent mixing and large-scale ascent ventilated 46 % of the boundary layer tracer, of which 10 % was above 2 km. Finally, coastal outflow, the sea breeze circulation, turbulent mixing, large-scale ascent and shallow convection together ventilated 52 % of the tracer into the free troposphere, of which 26 % was above 2 km.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} the present state and possible changes of water resources in Lake Ladoga and its drainage basin {{for the purposes of}} the sustainable development of North-Western Russia and Finland. The group assessed the state of the water resources in quantitative and qualitative terms, taking the system of sustainable development indicators suggested by the International Commission on Sustainable Development as a basis for assessment. These include pressure indicators (annual withdrawals of ground and surface water, domestic consumption of water per capita), state indicators (ground water reserves, concentration of faecalcoliform in fresh water, biochemical oxygen demand), and response indicators (waste-water treatment coverage, density of hydrological networks). The group proposed the following additional indicators and indices for the complex evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative state of the region's water resources: * Pressure indicators (external load, coefficient of anthropogenic pressure) * State indicators and indices (concentrations of chemicals in water, concentrations of chemicals in sediments, index of water pollution, critical load, critical limit, internal load, load/critical load, concentration/critical limit, internal load/external load, trophic state, biotic indicators and indices) * Response indicators (discharges of pure water, polluted water, partly treated water and the ratio between these, trans-boundary <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> state expenditure on environmental protection, human life span) The assessment considered both temporal and spatial aspects and produced a regional classification of the area according to the index of water pollution.

40|$|In Wallonia (Belgium), the {{maintenance}} of waterways is currently exclusively managed in a curative way. When local sediment accumulations are detected in waterways, bathymetric surveys are conducted in order to quantify the volume of sediment to be removed and chemical analyses of samples allow the characterization of sediment quality. Collected data only allow a short-term management of the matter generated by dredging operations. Medium- or long-term planning of dredging operations is currently not possible, {{due to a lack}} of knowledge on sediment fluxes and associated pollutant transport. In particular, issues related to the interactions and mixing of recent and older sediments, or to the input of sediment from unnavigable waterways into larger navigable waterways, are poorly understood. Operational tools allowing the assessment of the effectiveness of preventive measures to be implemented in order to improve the management of sediment in Walloon waterways also have to be developed. This research project aims at contributing to the development of such tools and focuses on the Samme river watershed (Senne catchment – loamy Brabant Region), deemed to be representative of Walloon issues. The Samme river is categorized as an unnavigable waterway. It runs along the old Charleroi-Brussels canal and flows into the new Charleroi-Brussels canal at the foot of the Ronquières inclined plane. The sediments of the bed of the Samme river are characterized by a high concentration of micropollutants (mainly PCB) and contribute to the contamination of a greater volume of sediments in the new Charleroi-Brussels canal, significantly increasing the cost of periodic dredging operations in the canal. The methodology developed is based on (I) an extended monitoring of sediment and pollutant fluxes at the outlet of the catchment and (II) an assessment of within-catchment sediment and pollutant transport. The origin of the Samme riverbed sediments contamination by PCB is poorly understood. Chemical analyses of the sediments of the bed were carried out along the linear course of the Samme river and its main tributary in order to identify the source of pollution. However, numerous connections between the old canal and the Samme river contribute to the transfer of stream sediments and pollutants between both systems and complicate the identification of the source of PCB. At the outlet of the catchment, different methods of river sediment sampling (automatic samplers, turbidity sensors, Time Integrated Samplers) are currently being implemented in order to (I) monitor the amount of suspended matter carried by the Samme river into the Charleroi-Brussels canal, (II) evaluate the associated <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> and (III) evaluate the possibility of setting up a system of retention of the sediments in the Samme catchment.

40|$|SEWSYS is a {{computer}} model designed for simulating <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from its’ sources to the urban stormwater system. The model is able to simulate concentrations of substances in stormwater – thereby reducing the need for sampling and analyses of stormwater – as well as establishing the major sources of the pollutants in the urban environment. The aim of this work has been to identify the sources of some selected organic pollutants, adjusting SEWSYS to these new substances and simulating their fluxes in urban stormwater. The simulation results have then been used to investigate proper barriers to prevent these substances to reach the environment. The prioritised pollutants chosen to be studied were four phthalates – DBP, DEHP, DINP and DIDP – nonylphenols (NP) and their ethoxylates (NPE). Phthalates are plasticisers used in PVC (often as coil coating), paint and sealants. NP/E:s are surfactants used {{in a range of}} materials, such as concrete, paint and plastics. In order to add these pollutants into the SEWSYS model, the emission of each substance from each of the identified sources was scrutinised. Depending on the overall lack of data, assumptions and estimations were necessary to be made for the emission calculations. Two housing areas and one area dominated by traffic were selected for the modelling. Information on the prevalence of the different sources together with rainfall data were used for the simulation of stormwater runoff and pollution load. The model was calibrated with measured stormwater flows and volumes, as well as analysed concentrations of the pollutants in stormwater from the chosen housing and traffic areas. The traffic area showed high concentrations of phthalates in the stormwater samples. DIDP, and particularly DINP, showed the highest concentrations in most samples, both from the traffic area and the housing areas. The NP and NPE concentrations in most samples were close to or under the detection limits for the analytical methods used. The calibration of the model showed that the runoff module in SEWSYS is able to predict the runoff volume well. After recalculating and adjusting some of the emission factors, the concentrations of the pollutants were in the same magnitude as the measured values. The simulations showed that vehicles are the dominating source of the phthalates in the traffic area. Parking spaces and concrete are indicated to emit significant amounts of NP/E:s. In the housing areas the construction materials – such as plastic coated steel for roofing and cladding – were the most important sources of phthalates. Parking spaces tend to cause high pollution loads of NP/E:s. To reduce the load of organic pollutants in the environment a combination of barriers can be used – these barriers may include legislative measures to prohibit the use of a substance, recommendations to the consumers (not) to use specific construction materials or installing technical measures such as sedimentation facilities. A preliminary simulation show that by using construction materials free from phthalates or NP/E:s or reducing the traffic load, combined with a technical barrier such as a sedimentation pond, the pollution load from housing or traffic area is considerably decreased...|$|E

A gauging station network in the Danshui River estuary is established to measure the data of water quality and discharge based on the efficient method. A boat mounted with an acoustic Doppler profiler (ADP) traverses the river along a preselected path that is normal to the streamflow to measure the velocities, water depths and water quality for calculating pollutant flux. To know {{the characteristics of the}} estuary and to provide the basis for the pollutant flux estimation model, data of complete tidal cycles is collected. The discharge estimation model applies the maximum velocity and water level to estimate mean velocity and cross-sectional area, respectively. Thus, the <b>pollutant</b> <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> the estuary can be easily computed as the product of the mean velocity, cross-sectional area and pollutant concentration. The good agreement between the observed and estimated <b>pollutant</b> <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> the Danshui River estuary shows that the pollutant measured by the conventional and the efficient methods are not fundamentally different.

40|$|Several {{studies show}} that there are {{interactive}} processes between eutrophication and uptake <b>of</b> persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> (POPs) in aquatic biota. The main concept is that the increased biomass and production in aquatic ecosystems, due to excess discharge of nutrients, causes a chain event that results in reduced uptake of POPs in primary producers (phytoplankton). This effect is then transferred to consumers at different trophic levels. The chain event may work {{in an indirect way}} by increasing the sedimentation of organic matter and, thereby, increasing the downward <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> to the bottoms, where they are caught in the organic sediment matrix. The chain event may also work in a direct way; the uptake of POPs in the fast growing phytoplankton is decreased as a result of "growth-dilution", and lower amounts <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> are transported in the food-web. The effect seen may also be a result of changed food-web structures that differ considerably from nutrient-poor to nutrient-rich ecosystems. In this paper, we use the existing knowledge of POPs behavior in aquatic systems of different nutrient status, to discuss possible interactive processes of eutrophication and contaminants in the Baltic Sea.

A follow-up of the water content is implemented during the infiltration in multi-layer columns by using TDR probes. The values and changes in infiltration rate are different if the drainage layer is above or below the sealing layer.

The electrical measurements in the drainage layers prove that the increase rate of the solute accumulation is the same for the both configuration and the same equilibrium solute concentration is reached.

40|$|A {{new model}} for the {{simulation}} of street canyon atmospheric chemical processing has been developed, by integrating an existing Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) dynamical model of canyon atmospheric motion with a detailed chemical reaction mechanism, the Reduced Chemical Scheme (RCS), comprising 51 chemical species and 136 reactions, based upon {{a subset of the}} Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM). The combined LES-RCS model is used to investigate both the effects of mixing and chemical processing upon air quality within an idealised street canyon. The effect of the combination of dynamical (segregation) and chemical effects is determined by comparing the outputs of the full LES-RCS canyon model with those obtained when representing the canyon as a zero-dimensional box model (i. e. assuming mixing is complete and instantaneous). The LES-RCS approach predicts lower (canyon-averaged) levels of NOX, OH and HO 2, but higher levels of O 3, compared with the box model run under identical chemical and emission conditions. Chemical processing of emissions within the canyon leads to {{a significant increase in the}} Ox flux from the canyon into the overlying boundary layer, relative to primary emissions, for the idealised case and a number of pollution scenarios considered. These results demonstrate that within-canyon atmospheric chemical processing can substantially alter the concentrations <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> injected into the urban canopy layer, compared with the raw emission rates within the street canyon and that such variations have a considerable effect on average within canyon concentrations and the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> out <b>of</b> the canyon into the urban background environment. ...|$|R

Since the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> {{is equal to the}} cross-wind integral of the product of concentration and wind speed, this should permit us to make a more precise estimate of the fugitive emission of mercury from the plant than could be obtained by using anemometer measurements of the wind.

Because of difficulties with the range resolution of the Doppler Lidar, the precision of this estimate was not as good as it should have been, though the difference from the rooftop anemometer remains statistically significant. Corrections of this magnitude are irrelevant to the Rosignano plant, where the emission rate varies strongly with the meteorological conditions. Where a precise estimate <b>of</b> a steady <b>flux</b> is required, however, reliable measurements of the wind profile {{in the wake of the}} source are essential.

In this work the levels of 16 priority PAHs were determined in water, pore water, sediment, soil and vegetable samples from Minjiang River Estuary, China. Total PAH concentrations varied from 9. 9 to 474 mug/l in water, 82. 1 to 239 mug/l in pore water, 112 to 877 ng/g dry wt. in surficial sediments, 128 to 465 ng/g dry wt. in soil and 8600 to 111 000 ng/g dry wt. in Chinese vegetables. Overall, the mean concentrations of PAHs were present in higher levels in pore water than that in surface water, due possibly to higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon or colloids with which the hydrophobic pollutants were strongly associated. Such a concentration gradient implies a potential <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from sediment pore water to overlying water.

The PAHs were present in higher levels in pore water than in surface water, due possibly to higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon or colloids with which the hydrophobic pollutants were strongly associated. Such a concentration gradient implies a potential <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from sediment pore water to overlying water. The levels of PAHs in water and pore water {{were significantly higher than}} those found in 1998, suggesting recent inputs of these compounds into the area and re-working of sediment phase. The composition pattern of PAHs in the three phases was dominated by high molecular weight PAHs, in particular 5 -ring PAHs. The salinity profile of dissolved PAHs suggested that they all behaved non-conservatively due to deviation from the theoretical dilution line. No correlation was found between PAH concentrations in sediment and those in pore water, and the correlation between the partition coefficients of PAHs and sediment organic carbon content was not significant, suggesting the complexity of the partition behaviour of PAHs. As a result of high PAH concentrations in water and pore water, it is likely that they may have caused mortality to certain exposed organisms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The design of the AGLITE instrument consists of a myriad of different components that are brought together in a strictly coordinated system. The overall design is broken into three main categories: the mechanical, optical, and electrical designs. The electrical design is equally essential {{in the operation of}} the final instrument as the mechanical and optical aspects and is closely intertwined with their workings. The electronics include all of the sensors and detectors, the data acquisition systems, the component control and synchronization circuitry, and the computers and data links. Combined with software, these allow the overall control of the system. This report documents the complete design of the electronics system for the AGLITE instrument from the conceptual layout of the instrument to the final fabrication. It is divided into two main portions. First, the high-level system design covers the scoping of the electronics system and the layout of the system architecture. It explains the major design decisions that were made before arriving at the implementation plan. The second portion of the report covers the detailed design of the electronics proceeding even to the circuit level where appropriate. It fully documents the critical details of the final system...|$|R
40|$|Waves {{are known}} to {{influence}} the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> to coastal waters via groundwater discharge. This study combines field measurements with numerical groundwater modelling to evaluate {{the influence of a}} period of intensified wave conditions (wave event) on nearshore groundwater flows and geochemistry in a sandy freshwater beach. Comprehensive vertical nested pressure transducer data obtained over a 2. 5 day isolated wave event reveal the development of transient groundwater flow recirculations through the nearshore aquifer combined with enhanced water exchange across the sediment-water interface (i. e., beach face). The wave-induced groundwater flows were simulated in FEFLOW using a phase-averaged wave setup approach to represent waves acting on the sediment-water interface. The time-varying measured and simulated hydraulic gradients match well indicating that consideration of wave setup alone, rather than instantaneous (phase-resolved) wave effects, is able to adequately capture wave-induced perturbations in nearshore groundwater flows. Additionally, the impact of the wave-induced groundwater flows on geochemical conditions near the sediment-water interface is illustrated by redox and pH fluctuations over the wave event. The observed fluctuations may considerably impact the fate <b>of</b> reactive <b>pollutants</b> discharging and also recirculating through a nearshore aquifer. In addition to the importance of the phase-averaged effect of waves, the phase-resolved effects of waves also need to be understood to better predict the fate of chemical and microbial constituents close to the sediment-water interface. Additional high frequency field measurements indicate that the phase-resolved effects of waves account for considerably larger <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> water and associated constituents exchanged across the sediment-water interface than the phase-averaged flux. Despite the large magnitude, the flux generated by phase-resolved wave effects is rapidly reversing in direction and thus is not expected to considerably influence dissolved constituents due to its short residence time, estimated to be between 3 ̆c 1 and 70 seconds. However, the exchange of particulates may be important as their transport is strongly governed by attachment and detachment processes. It is proposed that the rapid water exchange processes near the sediment-water interface control the fate and transport of particulate organic matter and fecal bacteria and thus are important for regulating nutrient and microbial coastal water quality...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{characteristics}} of non-point sources (NPS) pollutions can provide theoretical support for improving water quality. Siheshui watershed located in south China was selected to explore {{the characteristics}} of NPS pollutions in rainfall-runoff process. In this small agricultural watershed, five flood events and one non-flood event were monitored, and the water quantity and quality constituents were measured. The event mean concentrations (EMCs) <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> constituents in runoff flows were estimated. It is shown that the EMCs of BOD 5, CODMn, TSS, TP, TN, and NH 3 -N in the flood events are remarkably larger {{than those in the}} non-flood event. The antecedent precipitation has a large effect on the output <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> concentration. The <b>pollutant</b> load <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> most <b>pollutant</b> constituents change synchronously with the runoff flows, and the synchronization relationship is better than that between the pollutant concentrations and the runoff flows. The Pearson correlation analysis indicates that the EMCs of CODMn, TP, and TSS are significantly correlated with rainfall runoff characteristics in the flood events, while BOD 5, TN, and NH 3 -N show weak correlations. In addition, the mean concentration method was used to estimate the annual NPS pollution load. It is shown that the proportions of the NPS pollution load to the total pollutant load are more than 80 % from 2008 to 2010...|$|R
40|$|An Eulerian grid-based {{air quality}} {{model has been}} {{modified}} to include a resistance-based dry deposition code. The magnitude and spatial distribution of the dry deposition <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen-containing <b>pollutants</b> {{to the surface of}} the Los Angeles area was calculated as a function of land use. For August 1982 base case conditions, the dry deposition flux was 247 t of N per day (5 from NO, 49 from NO_ 2, 7 from PAN, 101 from HNO_ 3, 59 from NH_ 3, and 26 from NH 4 _NO_ 3), which corresponds to more than half of the daily NO_x emissions to the local atmosphere. The effects of emission controls on NO_x and hydrocarbon sources in Southern California as they existed in 1982 were examined. At the highest level of control studied (37 % reactive hydrocarbon reduction, 61 % NO_x reduction), the nitrogen dry flux would be 174 t of N per day after control (2 from NO, 20 from NO_ 2, 7 from PAN, 58 from HNO_ 3, 75 from NH_ 3, and 12 from NH_ 4 NO_ 3...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn the Mediterranean area, lagoons {{and coastal}} waters are often under the {{influence}} of intermittent rivers that contribute the majority <b>of</b> <b>pollutant</b> loads during flood events. Reliable tools for evaluating pollutant loads from land sources are needed for managing the water quality of the receiving waters, but available water quality models are not suitable for simulating these flash flood events. An operational tool, D-PoL (Diffuse-Pollution Load), to estimate the pollutant loads transferred during rainfall events by small Mediterranean rivers is described. The tool is based on a rainfall-load semi-distributed approach and was developed with the aim of simulating temporal variations in <b>fluxes</b> <b>of</b> dissolved <b>pollutants.</b> The model simulates pollutographs at the outlet of the catchment during rainfall events: the rainfall triggers the processes. The model can be described as a rainfall-load model. Three parameters describe the processes involved: the initial stock <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> on the hillslopes, the production parameter (which is related to the lag time of the catchment) and the routing parameter (which is related to the lag time of a basic river reach). First, sensitivity analysis demonstrated that each of the parameters controlled one key-feature of the pollutograph. The initial stock <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> influenced the amplitude of the pollutograph, the production parameter controlled the recession period, and the routing parameter influenced the rising phase. Second, the model was calibrated for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved phosphorus on a 20 -flood data set. The sets of optimal parameters were fitted to empirical relationships for both elements. On the 20 -flood calibration data set, the simulated total loads with adjusted parameters compared well with the observed parameters, except for very small events. Finally, the D-PoL model was checked against a new set of data, a 10 -flood validation data set. This final validation of the model showed that the dynamics of the pollutograph were not perfectly reproduced, but that simulated total loads agreed with the observed loads...|$|R
40|$|In {{a report}} on model evaluation, the authors ran the HYDRUS Code, among other {{transport}} codes, to evaluate the impacts of nonequilibrium sorption sites on the time-evolution of 99 Tc and 90 Sr through the vadose zone. Since our evaluation {{was based on a}} rather low, annual recharge rate, many of the numerical results derived from HYDRUS indicated that the nonequilibrium sorption sites, in essence, acted as equilibrium sorption sites. To help explain these results, we considered a ''stripped-down'' version of the HYDRUS system. This ''stripped-down'' version possesses two dependent variables, one for the radionuclides in solution and the other for the radionuclides adsorbed to the nonequilibrium sites; and it possesses constant physical parameters. The resultant governing equation for the radionuclides in solution is a linear, advection-dispersion-reaction (i. e., radioactive decay) partial differential equation containing a history integral term accounting for the nonequilibrium sorption sites. It is this ''stripped-down'' version, which {{is the subject of this}} paper. We found an exact solution to this new version of the model. The exact solution is given in terms of a single definite integral of terms involving elementary functions of the independent variables and the system parameters. This integral possesses adequate convergence properties and is easy to evaluate, both in a quantitative matter and in a qualitative manner. The parameters that are considered in the system are as follows: the radionuclide's equilibrium partition coefficient between water and soil, the bulk density of the soil, the fractions of equilibrium/nonequilibrium sorption sites, the volumetric water content, the first order equilibrium adsorption rate constant, the first order radioactive decay rate constant, the liquid water soil tortuosity factor, the molecular diffusion coefficient in water, the longitudinal dispersivity factor, and the Darcian fluid flux density. In addition, the system possesses a stepwise, variable source of radionuclides at the ground surface and a variable <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from the vadose zone at the water table. Although this new system is a ''stripped down'' version of the HYDRUS Code, it is a valuable system in its own right for the assessment of nonequilibrium sorption of radionuclides in the vadose zone...|$|R
30|$|<b>Fluxes</b> <b>of</b> {{stormwater}} <b>pollutants</b> {{were estimated}} {{by using the}} dynamic integrated, lumped conceptual stormwater quality model presented by Vezzaro et al. (2012 a). This model combines a catchment submodel (Vezzaro and Mikkelsen 2012) with a stormwater treatment unit submodel for micropollutants (STUMP—Vezzaro et al. 2010). The catchment submodel estimates stormwater runoff flow based on a non-linear reservoir approach. Stormwater runoff quality is estimated based on an accumulation-washoff process, where release <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the rainfall intensity and the pollutant mass available in the catchment. The treatment unit submodel is based on a serial tanks approach. The number of tanks is defined according of the hydraulic residence time and the geometric characteristics of the treatment unit, reproducing the hydraulic behaviour of the unit (including hydraulic short-circuiting). The fate of TSS and Cu is modelled by including the following processes among a larger range of processes represented in the STUMP model: settling and resuspension of sediments (TSS) and adsorption/desorption of Cu to/from TSS, thus representing Cu as both a particle-bound and a dissolved species. Settling and resuspension is modelled in a lumped manner for the whole treatment unit focusing solely on TSS and the sorbed Cu. Particle size distribution, effects of wind and temperature on resuspension, etc. are not considered by the model. The catchment submodel provides total pollutant loads and concentrations, while the treatment unit distinguishes between the dissolved and the particle-bound fractions. For more details regarding the model refer to Vezzaro et al. (2012 a).|$|R
