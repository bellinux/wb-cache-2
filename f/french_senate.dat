40|$|Abstract Decimal time. Analysis of a {{rational}} reform. Decimal tideräkning. Analys av ett rationellt förslag. Christina Rydberg    University of Stockholm. History of ideas. Bachelor’s study. Autumn 2014 Mentor: Elisabeth Mansén   The {{aim of this}} study is to try to understand why the late 18 th century French attempt to introduce decimal time was a failure. The question is whether there are substantial differences to be seen when compared to the rest of the reforms, like the meter. What part did politics, science, implementation, design and public opinion play in the outcome? The study draws on primary sources on decimal time, such as minutes of the <b>French</b> Convention and <b>Senate</b> (Gallica data base), as well as secondary sources on the contemporary reforms. There are few studies on decimal time; but those of Michel Froeschlé and Lars Nystedt introduce important aspects. Literature is otherwise mainly focused on the spatial reforms and especially on definition and introduction of the meter. The method used is close reading with the purpose of identifying arguments and circumstances relevant to the outcome of the reform.   The result of this study concurs with prior research in the impression that the “revolutionary” halo of the calendar discredited decimal time, especially in other countries. Also confusion was created by old names given to the new hours and minutes. The watchmakers disliked not being able to sell their stock of handicraft. Finally, most people disliked fewer days off. This study further argues that the reform was given away by the French Convention in order to save the rest of spatial metric reforms including decimalization. It also highlights the ambiguity with which the reform was abolished by the politicians. The metric reforms had meant creating standards, defining units and agreeing on what mathematical base to be used. It is important to note that the arguments for abolishing decimal time were less negative to decimalization than to other parts of the reform. The study suggests that if the French reform on time had been limited to the decimal dimension alone, the possibilities for success could have been greater. Instead decimal time was introduced as part of a revolutionary era and disappeared with the persons who created this vision.   Key words: Decimal time, metric reform, Republican calendar, 18 th century, French revolutio...|$|R
25|$|In 1860, Haussmann {{complained that}} the cemeteries inside the city posed {{a serious threat to}} public health, and {{proposed}} to ban burials in the city.

The project ran into strong opposition in the <b>French</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1867, however, and Napoleon decided to postpone it indefinitely.|$|E

The <b>French</b> <b>Senate,</b> however, blocked the change in the French constitution, in order to maintain good relations with Turkey. The current situation according to the French constitution is as follows: if 3/5 of the delegates (from the Senate and the Parliament) agree to the accession of Turkey, there will be no referendum.|$|E

500|$|Sérurier led a {{division}} in Napoleon Bonaparte's Italian campaign of 1796, except during bouts of illness. He especially distinguished {{himself at the}} Battle of Mondovì and the Siege of Mantua. In 1799, he again fought in Italy during the War of the Second Coalition at Verona, Magnano and Cassano, being captured in the latter action. After being paroled, he supported Napoleon's rise to political power in the Coup of 18 Brumaire in late 1799. The apex of his career occurred on 19 May 1804 when Napoleon appointed him a Marshal of the Empire. His active military career over, Sérurier served in the <b>French</b> <b>Senate</b> and was ennobled by Napoleon. In 1814 as the First French Empire was crumbling, he burned all the many flags captured by the French armies. His troops called him the [...] "Virgin of Italy" [...] for his rigorous standards of discipline and honesty in an army known for generals who enriched themselves by plundering the conquered territories. His surname {{is one of the}} names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 24.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{even the}} minds of reformers like Gogel had become {{receptive}} {{to the need for}} change. The frustrations of the stalemate between unitarist reformers and democratically elected federalist obstructionists had caused a certain disillusionment with democratic politics in the former (the latter were already convinced). An alliance was therefore forming between the would-be reformers, who would like to finally push their reforms through, by [...] "Bonapartist" [...] means, if necessary, and the people who wished to restore the old federal order, {{in the hands of the}} old regent class. Director Besier in particular was amenable to a project that would extend executive power (and curtail that of the Assembly), and revert the constitution to federal devolution. With the help of Sémonville he now started to push a project of constitutional reform that followed the French Constitution of the Year VIII in important respects: a bicameral legislature would be appointed by a [...] "National College" [...] (akin to the <b>French</b> <b>Senate)</b> from a list of names produced by a convoluted system of national elections. This met with little enthusiasm by two of the other Directors François Ermerins and Jean Henri van Swinden, and by the Representative Assembly, that rejected the project on 11 June 1801, by fifty votes to twelve.|$|E
