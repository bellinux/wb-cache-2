BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 3 % to 4 % of the population over 65 years of age. It is associated with thromboembolic complications, worsening heart failure, and increased mortality, yet the electrical and structural remodeling that occurs with human aging remains unknown. MethodsThirteen patients (66. 4 ± 1. 7 years) ≥ 60 years (group A), 13 patients (50 ± 2. 1 years) age 31 to 59 years (group B), and 15 patients (24. 7 ± 1. 0 years) ≤ 30 years (group C) underwent conventional electrophysiologic studies and electroanatomic mapping. We measured atrial refractoriness (ERP) at the distal coronary sinus (CS); low and <b>high</b> lateral <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> (LRA) and the <b>high</b> septal <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> at 600, 500, and 400 ms; maximum corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT); P-wave duration (PWD); conduction time (CT) along the CS and LRA; and discrete double potentials (DP) along the crista. ResultsAging was associated with an increase in atrial ERP, prolonged CT along the CS, increased PWD and CSNRT. There was no significant change in dispersion of refractoriness or rate adaptation. Electroanatomic mapping revealed diffuse areas of low voltage with regional conduction slowing. Both techniques demonstrated a greater number of DPs and fractionated signals along the crista terminalis with aging. ConclusionsAging is associated with regional conduction slowing, anatomically determined conduction delay at the crista, and structural changes that include areas of low voltage. In addition, impairment of sinus node function and an increase in atrial ERP occurred with aging. This electrical and structural remodeling may explain the increased propensity to AF with aging...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{tested the}} ability of dual-site right atrial pacing to prevent atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) or atrial flutter induced by eingle-site atrial pacing and correlated its efficacy with clinical patient characteristics, atrial activation times and refractory periods. Background. Prevention of recurrent AF with long-term dual-site right atrial pacing has been demonstrated in our previous studies. However, the mechanism of antiarrhythmic benefit is unclear. Methods. Using standard electrophysiologic methods, baseline electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic measurements (mean ± SD) were obtained. Programmed atrial stimulation was performed for AF or atrial flutter induction. Atrial pacing was performed at two drive cycle lengths (600 and 400 ms) and followed by one to three atrial extrastimuli at one to four pacing sites in the right atrium. In patients with inducible AF or atrial flutter, reinduction was then attempted during a dual-site atrial pacing drive train. This was achieved by simultaneously pacing at the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and coronary sinus ostium at an identical rate to the baseline stimulation, with the atrial extrastimuli being delivered at the pacing site responsible for the initial AF episode initiation. Results. Twenty patients (10 men, 10 women, mean [±SD] age 64 ± 16 years) with symptomatic AF (n = 10) or atrial flutter (n = 10) were studied. There was a significant abbreviation of the P wave duration to 103 ± 17 ms with dual-site pacing compared with sinus rhythm (120 ± 12 ms, p = 0. 005) and high right atrial pacing (121 ± 17 ms, p = 0. 005). This was also associated with a characteristic change in P wave configuration with an inferior and leftward axis shift. The effective refractory period at the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> remained unchanged with dual-site atrial pacing compared with single-site high right atrial pacing. Sixteen patients had inducible AF or atrial flutter and could be tested after dual-site atrial pacing. The induced atrial tachyarrhythmia was suppressed in nine patients (56 %), who had either induced AF (n = 5) or atrial flutter (n = 4). The difference in the effective refractory period between the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and the coronary sinus ostium pacing sites was significantly greater (33 ± 12 ms) in patients with suppression of atrial tachyarrhythmia with dual-site atrial pacing compared with patients without suppression (15 ± 13 ms, p = 0. 001). P wave abbreviation did not correlate with arrhythmia suppression. There was no correlation between suppression of inducible AF or atrial flutter and demographic or clinical patient characteristics. Conclusions. Dual-site right atrial pacing from the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and coronary sinus ostium can suppress inducible AF or atrial flutter elicited after single-site high right atrial pacing in selected patients. Acute suppression is more likely in patients with greater dispersion of right atrial refractoriness between these two sites.

AimTo prospectively evaluate and compare {{the duration}} and composition of the excitable gap during typical counterclockwise atrial flutter {{in different parts of the}} circuit all around the tricuspid annulus. MethodsThe excitable gap was determined by introducing a premature stimulus at various sites around the tricuspid annulus during typical counterclockwise atrial flutter in 34 patients. Excitable gap was calculated as the difference between the longest resetting coupling interval and the effective atrial refractory period. ResultsThe duration of the excitable gap, the effective atrial refractory period and the resetting coupling interval differed significantly along the tricuspid annulus. Duration of excitable gap was significantly longer at the low lateral <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> (79 ± 22 ms) than at the cavotricuspid isthmus (66 ± 23 ms; P= 0. 002). The effective atrial refractory period was significantly longer at the cavotricuspid isthmus (160 ± 26 ms) than at the <b>high</b> lateral <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> (149 ± 29 ms; P= 0. 004).

This study {{investigated}} the efficacy and tolerability of low energy shocks for termination of atrial fibrillation in patients, using an endocardial electrode configuration that embraced both atria. Background. In animals, low energy biphasic shocks delivered between electrodes in the coronary sinus and right atrium have effectively terminated atrial fibrillation. If human defibrillation thresholds are sufficiently low, atrial defibrillation could be achieved in conscious patients using an implanted device. Methods. Twenty-two consecutive patients with stable atrial fibrillation were studied during electrophysiologic testing. Biphasic R wave synchronous shocks were delivered between large surface area electrodes in the coronary sinus and <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium,</b> using a step-up voltage protocol starting at 10 or 20 V and increasing {{to a maximum of}} 400 V. Patients were conscious {{at the start of the}} study and were asked to report on symptoms but were sedated later if shocks were not tolerated. Results. Cardioversion was achieved in all 19 patients who completed the study, with a mean (±SD) leading-edge voltage of 237 ± 55 V (range 140 to 340) and mean energy of 2. 16 ± 1. 02 J (range 0. 7 to 4. 4).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one patients with lone PAF and 23 patients with AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia ablation without history of PAF (control group) were recruited. Endocardial recordings were made during sinus rhythm and programmed atrial stimulation. The authors measured the interatrial conduction time, the 'right-sided' conduction time between the <b>high</b> lateral <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and the proximal coronary sinus (RA-CSp), and the 'left-sided' conduction time between the proximal and the distal coronary sinus (CSp-LA). During sinus rhythm, the interatrial conduction time was longer in the PAF group (103 +/- 19 vs 86 +/- 12 ms, P< 0. 01) due to delay of right-sided conduction (RA-CSp was 74 +/- 20 vs 56 +/- 10 ms, P< 0. 01). During programmed stimulation at the distal coronary sinus, the maximal RA-CSp time was also longer in the PAF group (110 +/- 47 vs 69 +/- 16 ms, P< 0. 05).

After recordings during sinus rhythm (SR), MAPs were recorded during programmed stimulation (PS) via the HLRA catheter at a drive cycle length (CL) of 500 ms. Thus, MAPs were recorded simultaneously from 2 sites at a time and sequentially from 4 to 12 sites during SR, drive pacing and PS. Taking the MAP at the HLRA as reference, the dispersion of repolarization time (dispersion of RT) and its two components, the dispersions of activation time (dispersion of AT) and MAP duration (dispersion of MAP duration) among the 4 to 12 sites were calculated and taken as parameters of DAR. RESULTS: During SR and PS, the maximal dispersion of RT was significantly greater in AF than in control patients, 113 +/- 49 ms vs 50 +/- 28 ms (P< 0. 001) and 114 +/- 56 vs 70 +/- 43 ms (P< 0. 05) respectively. The increased dispersion of RT in the AF group was caused by increases in both dispersion of MAP duration and dispersion of AT.

An initial {{crossover}} study comparing dual- and single-site right atrial pacing was performed {{followed by a}} long-term efficacy and safety evaluation of dual-site right atrial pacing in patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). Also examined was the efficacy of two single-site right atrial pacing modes (<b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and coronary sinus ostium) and the long-term need for cardioversion, antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic drug therapies during dual-site atrial pacing. Methods. Thirty consecutive patients with drug-refractory symptomatic AF and documented primary or drug-induced bradycardia were implanted with a dual chamber rate-responsive pacemaker and two atrial leads. Single-site atrial pacing was performed at the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> or the coronary sinus ostium. Continuous atrial pacing was maintained. Results. Mean arrhythmia-free intervals increased from 9 ± 10 days in the control period preceding implant to 143 ± 110 days (p < 0. 0001) in single-site right atrial pacing and 195 ± 96 days in dual-site right atrial pacing (p < 0. 005 versus single-site pacing and p < 0. 0001 versus control). Dual-site right atrial pacing significantly increased the proportion of patients free of AF recurrence (89 %) as compared to single-site right atrial pacing (62 %, p = 0. 02). High right atrial pacing and coronary sinus ostial pacing had similar efficacy for AF prevention. Effective rhythm control was achieved in 86 % of patients during dual right atrial pacing. Seventy-eight percent of patients at 1 year and 56 % at 3 years remained free of symptomatic AF. The need for cardioversion was reduced after pacemaker implant (p < 0. 05) and antithrombotic therapy was reduced (p < 0. 06) without any thromboembolic event. Coronary sinus ostial lead dislodgement was not observed after discharge. Conclusions. Atrial pacing in combination with antiarrhythmic drugs eliminates or markedly reduces recurrent AF. Prevention of AF is enhanced by dual-site right atrial pacing. High right atrial and coronary sinus ostial pacing do not differ in efficacy. Dual-site right atrial pacing is safe, achieves long-term rhythm control in most patients, decreases the need for cardioversion, and antithrombotic therapy can be selectively reduced...|$|E

Coronary angiography demonstrated a dilated left main coronary artery with a giant fistu-lous channel draining into the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> with otherwise normal coronary artery anatomy. Coronary steal was postulated as the etiology of the patient’s symptoms. She underwent surgical li-gation and resection of the coronary fistula with an uneventful postoperative course. Coronary artery fistulae are defined as vascular connections from a coronary artery, bypassing the myocardial capillary bed, to a cardiac chamber or major central blood vessel. 1 It is a rare condition occurring in 0. 2 % of the general population. 2 Coronary artery fistulae are associated with compli-cations such as pulmonary hypertension, heart fail-ure, endocarditis, spontaneous rupture, thrombosis and myocardial ischemia secondary to a steal phe-nomenon. 3 In patients with significant shunting, treatment strategies include percutaneous coiling, balloon embolization or surgical ligation. 4 Supplementary material Supplementary material is available at QJME...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of detecting His-Purkinje system (HPS) activity from an intracardiac lead field (HR bipole) between catheter electrodes in the <b>high</b> <b>right</b> <b>atrium</b> and the right ventricular apex. A secondary endpoint was to determine if the resolution and sampling typically used in pacemakers would reproduce the electrophysiology (EP) lab results. Using data obtained during EP studies, HR bipole recordings were signal averaged and bandpass filtered. The interval between the onset of HPS activity and the onset of the QRS complex (HV interval) in the HR bipole was measured in 7 datasets and compared to His Bundle Electrograms (HBE). The HR bipole and distal HBE produced linearly related results, offset by the delay of 18 msec attributed to the time between actual HPS onset and the HPS onset in the distal HBE recording. A/D resolution was degraded and data were down sampled to 244 Hz and 8 bits, respectively to simulate pacemaker recordings. There was little to no detectable HPS activity in these pacemaker-simulated recordings. Additional data is necessary before conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of the HR bipole for HV measurement with an implantable device using these reduced data acquisition parameters. 1...|$|E
