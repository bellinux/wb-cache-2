40|$|SummarySediment {{concentration}} (SC) –water discharge (Q) {{relations in}} rivers are typically governed by multiple and relatively complex processes. Due to <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effects,</b> sediment discharges can differ for similar or equivalent water discharges, which causes scatter in empirical datasets and may decrease the predictive power of SC rating curves. Such <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effects</b> {{must therefore be}} understood and accounted for to make dependable predictions for river system management. The overall objectives {{of this study are}} to develop modelling approaches suitable for reproducing and predicting <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effects</b> at larger scales and to investigate the possible contribution of in-channel processes (erosion and deposition) to sediment concentration hysteresis loops. To investigate relevant field-scale conditions, we develop a one-dimensional dynamic sediment transport model of the downstream Tuul River (northern Mongolia), investigating in-channel processes along a 141 km stretch during a hydrological year. The results show that the present modelling approach can reproduce both anti-clockwise and clockwise <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effects.</b> Importantly, in-channel processes alone can cause considerable anti-clockwise <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effects</b> without being reinforced by catchment processes such as hillslope erosion. Such specific contributions from in-channel processes introduced data scatter into the sediment rating curves, decreasing their R 2 -values from unity to approximately 0. 5 to 0. 6. More generally, possible changes in the number or magnitude of high-flow events, caused by climatic or other anthropogenic factors, could influence total sediment deposition, which was primarily found to occur during relatively short high-flow events. Such potential changes also have important implications for the possible spreading of polluted sediments...|$|R
50|$|This main {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its vertical deformation is increasing, which is resisted by the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effect.</b> Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its vertical deformation is decreasing. This is again resisted by the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>effect.</b> In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.|$|E
