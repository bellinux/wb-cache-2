Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E

Finnerty III and its District Court sibling decisions were wrongly decided. Specialists presented a uniquely thorny issue of agency law to the Federal Courts in New York.

Next the part of the muscles that originates from the spina scapulae, the posterior one third to one half, is isolated from the anterior portion of the muscle. The insertion of the posterior deltoid is then elevated of the muscle and the distance between the mobilized deltoid tendon to the olecranon is measured to determine the length of the <b>interposition</b> graft needed.

40|$|Background: In this {{experimental}} study, we {{aimed to}} determine the possible changes in fracture healing due to denervation and/or nerve ending <b>interpositioning.</b> Methods: 50 Wistar Albino type male rats were divided into three study groups. A standard transverse diaphysial fracture in the femurs of {{the same side of}} all subjects under anesthesia was created and the fracture were fixed intramedullarily. While preserving the structural integrity of the sciatic nerve in the first group, neurectomy to the nerve in the second group was performed. In the third group, following the sciatic nerve cut, the proximal end of the nerve were interposed the fracture line. After a 28 -day observational period, the callus formation in the subjects was examined radiologically, biomechanically and histopathologically. Results: Among all groups, the third group subjects showed significant increase in radiological area measurements when they are compared to the second group rats. There {{was no significant difference in}} biomechanical measurements of fractured femurs of the three groups. In histopathological evaluations, it was observed that denervation had increased the thickness of the cartilage and the number of the chondrocytes and osteoclasts significantly but decreased the number of fibroblasts compared to the control group. In addition to the denervation nerve ending <b>interpositioning</b> increased the bone thickness and the number of the osteoblasts but decreased the number of the osteoclasts significantly. Conclusions: While radiological observations exhibit that nerve ending <b>interpositioning</b> has resulted more hypertrophic callus formation, histopathological evaluations led us to that denervation created partial (immature) callus formation and nerve ending <b>interpositioning</b> demonstrated larger but immature callus formation...|$|R

40|$|AIM The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of a connective tissue graft (CTG) or a collagen matrix (CM) <b>interpositioned</b> between flaps and non-shedding hard surfaces on wound stability. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty bone dehiscence defects were prepared in five Beagle dogs. Three treatments were performed in 12 sites per dog: (1) repositioned flaps were sutured onto instrumented dentin surfaces (control), (2) repositioning of flaps with an <b>interpositioned</b> CTG and (3) repositioning of flaps with the application of a CM. To allow postoperative healing with n = 5 for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days before evaluation, the sutures were removed, incision lines retraced and tensile forces applied to the flaps. The minimum magnitude of forces required to detach the flaps from the wound bed was recorded. RESULTS After 1 week of healing, 6 N had to be applied to disrupt flaps from their wound bed in the CTG group. In the control group, a similar magnitude of resistance was achieved after 2 weeks (6. 1 N). Flap resistance to tearing was highest in the CTG group (maximum 9. 1 N) 2 weeks postoperatively. On the third postoperative day, the mean tearing forces of all groups differed significantly, displaying a 50 % lower resistance to tearing in the CM compared to the CTG group. In comparison, flap resistance to tearing forces established earlier and in higher magnitude in sites with an <b>interpositioned</b> CTG than in flaps repositioned on dentin or CM. CONCLUSIONS Application of a CTG, sutured to a non-shedding hard surface, significantly increased flap resistance to tearing when applying disrupting forces compared to controls. A less pronounced effect was achieved by <b>interpositioning</b> of a CM...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of Cooper v.

Rhode Island justified its position on the embargo act based on the explicit language of <b>interposition.</b> However, none of these states actually passed a resolution nullifying the Embargo Act. Instead, they challenged it in court, appealed to Congress for its repeal, and proposed several constitutional amendments.|$|E

25|$|As {{the broad}} {{cultural}} region remained politically divided, the sharp antagonisms between empires stimulated appearance of variations of Turco-Persian culture. The {{main reason for}} this was Safavids’ introduction of Shiism into Persia, done to distinguish themselves from their Sunni neighbors, especially Ottomans. After 1500, the Persian culture developed distinct features of its own, and <b>interposition</b> of strong Shiite culture hampered exchanges with Sunni peoples on Persia's western and eastern frontiers. The Sunni peoples of eastern Mediterranean in Asia Minor, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Sunnis of Central Asia and India developed somewhat independently. Ottoman Turkey grew more like its Arab Muslim neighbors in West Asia; India developed a South Asian style of Indo-Persian culture; and Central Asia, which gradually grew more isolated, changed relatively little.|$|E
25|$|Ophiuchus {{is located}} between Aquila, Serpens and Hercules, {{northwest}} {{of the center of}} the Milky Way. The southern part lies between Scorpius to the west and Sagittarius to the east. In the northern hemisphere, it is best visible in summer. It is located opposite Orion in the sky. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpent; the <b>interposition</b> of his body divides the snake constellation Serpens into two parts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda, which are nonetheless counted as one constellation. Ophiuchus straddles the equator but lies predominately to its south. However, Rasalhague, a fairly conspicuous star in its north, is circumpolar north of 78° north latitude. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination. Segments of the ecliptic that lie within Ophiuchus lie south of −20° declination. A determination of exactly where these stars are visible on Earth would depend on atmospheric refraction, the Novaya Zemlya effect, mountains and clouds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{money market}} funds began disintermediating banks from their classic <b>interposition</b> between savers and borrowers. The funds {{provided}} a more direct link, with less overhead. Large banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Notably, the Fed is itself owned by the large private banks, and controls the overall supply {{of money in the}} United States. The OCC is housed within the Treasury Department, which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multi-trillion dollar debt of the U.S. government. The overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs. actual ongoing tax receipts. Unquestionably, the private banking industry, bank regulation, the national debt, and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected. Interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the Fed, and inflation (all else being equal) allows today's fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars. The third major bank regulator, designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that are failing, with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself. They also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits.|$|E

To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only sure way of preventing tyranny of the majority.
