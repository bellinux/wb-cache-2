The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, medicines and water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food blankets and utensils.|$|E

5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupuaa generally {{took the form of}} long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.|$|E
5|$|When the {{projects}} begin, {{the work is}} done without machines, with supplies being shipped on small boats and then carried by hand from the beach. Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in a worst-case scenario, if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane-force winds blew down trees, signs, {{and power}} lines {{in and around}} La Paz, while closer to the beach the {{hurricane}} destroyed multiple beach huts. Rough surf in the harbor of La Paz sunk one fishing vessel and grounded four others. Efforts by the Mexican Navy prevented an additional vessel and two cruise ships from being grounded. In Cabo San Lucas, effects were minimal, amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2inches (50mm). The passage of the hurricane left citizens in Todos Santos without power for around 24hours. Heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding, destroying bridges and multiple mudslides, some of which blocked roads. Flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads, causing the Mexican government to restrict traffic {{through much of the}} peninsula for up to a week after the storm. Many roads remained impassable for a month after the hurricane. The closed roads and the airport in La Paz and southern Baja California left some tourists stranded. The rainfall was welcome in some desert areas, where the moderate precipitation filled reservoirs. Two rescue workers died when they were swept away by the floodwaters. Six municipalities in Baja California were declared disaster areas, and by four days after landfall, the Mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of the affected citizens.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Perth's {{relative}} geographical isolation, it has never had the necessary conditions to develop significant manufacturing industries other than those serving the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of its residents, mining, agriculture and some specialised areas, such as, in recent times, niche shipbuilding and maintenance. It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the eastern states or overseas.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{spirituality in}} the period before Jesus was highly {{corporate}} and public, based mostly on the worship services of the synagogues, which included the reading and interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures and the recitation of prayers, and on the major festivals. Thus, private spirituality was strongly influenced by the liturgies and by the scriptures (e.g., {{the use of the}} Psalms for prayer), and individual prayers often recalled historical events just as much as they recalled their own <b>immediate</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The U.S. National Rifle Association {{collected}} and shipped {{large numbers of}} privately donated rifles {{for use by the}} Home Guard. These were {{collected and}} destroyed after the war. Within a few months they were issued proper uniforms and equipment, as the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of the regular forces were satisfied. After September 1940 the army began to take charge of the Home Guard training in Osterley, and Wintringham and his associates were gradually sidelined. Wintringham resigned in April 1941. Ironically, despite his support of the Home Guard, Wintringham was never allowed to join the organisation himself because of a policy barring membership by communists and fascists.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{environmental}} conditions experienced by humans during spaceflight {{are very different from}} those in which humans evolved; however, technology is able to shield people from the harshest conditions, such as that offered by a spaceship or spacesuit. The <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by a life support system, a group of devices that allow human beings to survive in outer space. The life support system supplies air, water and food. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary.|$|E

25|$|In July 1950 United States Department of Defense {{planners}} did not foresee {{that the}} Korean campaign {{would be of}} long duration. Consequently, the Fifth Air Force modified its command structure only to meet <b>immediate</b> <b>needs.</b> When {{the time came to}} move tactical air units to Korean airfields, Fifth Air Force did not deploy its permanent wings because they were heavily committed to the air defense of Japan. Instead, it utilized temporary air base squadrons and air base units to support tactical units in Korea. By August, the situation called for larger organizations with greater allotments of personnel and equipment, and Fifth Air Force set up five temporary tactical support wings to support the combat groups.|$|E
25|$|When Allenby first assumed {{command of}} the Egyptian Expeditionary Force he quickly joined the army in the field leaving the {{political}} and administrative problems related to the Egyptian Mandate to a Government appointee with a suitable staff. The area of formerly Ottoman territory now under occupation also required management, and {{with the approval of}} the Government, Allenby appointed a Chief Administrator for Palestine. He divided the country into four districts: Jerusalem, Jaffa, Majdal and Beersheba, each under a military governor. Under this administration the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of the people were provided for, seed grain and live–stock were imported and distributed, finance on easy terms was made available through the Army bankers, a stable currency was set up and postal services restored.|$|E
25|$|Mobilization, popular {{demonstration}} and social movements, {{came together in}} a new way in response to the devastating 1985 earthquakes. The scope of the destruction invigorated the dormant women's movement to meet the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs</b> of families. Feminist groups, local grass-roots organizations, and NGOs stepped in to offer aid that the government or official political organizations were either unable or incapable of providing. There was a recognition during this time that a short-term disaster relief movement could be turned into an organization focused on implementing long-term political gain. Simultaneously, several worker's unions implemented female advisory boards, with the goals of educating, training and politically organizing garment workers. Feminists serving on advisory boards made workers aware that they could change the environment and attitude of their places of employment and demand changes in areas other than wages and hours. Expanding demands to address sexual harassment, cover child and health care, improve job training and education, raised workers awareness and changed the actual work conditions.|$|E

25|$|The church also {{distributes}} {{money through}} its Humanitarian Services division to natural disaster victims worldwide. The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for worldwide shipment to disaster victims, works {{to establish a}} global sense of self-reliance, and offers service opportunities to both church members and non-members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, one million hygiene kits, and one million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries. When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the <b>immediate</b> <b>needs,</b> and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours. Missionaries are then sent to help alleviate other long-term damages by assisting injured persons and reconstructing damaged buildings. The church carries out these efforts {{without regard to the}} nationality or religion of the recipients, and 100 percent of the financial contributions donated to the church by members and non-members are used for humanitarian purposes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 67, {{and still}} financially embarrassed, Nicholson resumed his writing, finally getting his Treatise on Dialing {{published}} in Newcastle in 1833, {{and set up a}} school in the recently opened Royal Arcade, which he ran for a few years, though it was not a financial success. He was nevertheless highly regarded by the local people and was awarded honorary memberships of a number of local institutions, including the Newcastle Mechanics' Institute. In 1834, an attempt was made to raise, by public subscription, sufficient funds to purchase an annuity for his benefit, but as only £320 was raised it was deemed insufficient for the purpose and was handed directly to Nicholson to help with his <b>immediate</b> <b>needs,</b> and a petition was sent to the king in an attempt to secure a pension for him from the Privy Purse. In October 1836, he was elected President of the Newcastle Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts and in August 1838, he presented a paper entitled Principles of Oblique Bridges to the eighth meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which was held in Newcastle.|$|E
500|$|The mayoral {{administration}} of the CUA is empowered to govern the city with de jure autonomy; {{a wide range of}} mechanisms have been established to facilitate governance, although they are of limited effectiveness. An urban master plan guides major policies for city management but personnel within the mayoral office commonly lack the urban planning and management ability to effectively implement the plan in response to long-term and <b>immediate</b> <b>needs.</b> This challenge is compounded by the high turnover rate of mayors and staff that frequently disrupts initiatives begun by previous CUA administrations. A mayor under former president Didier Ratsiraka created [...] "red zones"; areas where public gathering and protests were prohibited. On 28 June 2001, Ravalomanana abolished these areas, liberalizing freedom of assembly.|$|E
