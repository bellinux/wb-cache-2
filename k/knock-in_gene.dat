40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the functions of}} the p 53 tumor suppressor, we created a new <b>knock-in</b> <b>gene</b> replacement mouse model in which the endogenous Trp 53 gene is substituted by one encoding p 53 ERTAM, a p 53 fusion protein whose function is completely dependent on ectopic provision of 4 -hydroxytamoxifen. We show here that both tissues in vivo and cells in vitro derived from such mice can be rapidly toggled between wild-type and p 53 knockout states. Using this rapid perturbation model, we define the kinetics, dependence, persistence and reversibility of p 53 -mediated responses to DNA damage in tissues in vivo and to activation of the Ras oncoprotein and stress in vitro. This is the first example to our knowledge of a new class of genetic model that allows the specific, rapid and reversible perturbation of the function of a single endogenous gene in vivo.

CRISPR/Cas 9 mediates efficient <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> in human cells, embryos, and plants. Schumann et al. reported successful introduction of exogenous DNA into T cells genome at the Cas 9 cleavage site. Although the knock-in of large fragments, such as a CAR in T cells, remains challenging, doing so is desirable for therapeutic application and needs further exploration. Sather et al. reported the feasibility of knock-in of a CAR transgene in T cells with MegaTal and an AAV HDR template (Sather et al., 2015).

Fgfr 2 is expressed by OLs in myelinated fiber tracks. In vitro, Fgfr 2 is highly upregulated during OL terminal differentiation, and its activation leads to enhanced growth of OL processes {{and the formation}} of myelin-like membranes. To investigate the in vivo function of Fgfr 2 signaling by myelinating glial cells, we inactivated the floxed Fgfr 2 gene in mice that coexpress Cre recombinase (cre) as a <b>knock-in</b> <b>gene</b> into the OL-specific 2 �, 3 �-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Cnp 1) locus. Surprisingly, no obvious defects were detected in brain development of these conditional mutants, including the number of OLs, the onset and extent of myelination, the ultrastructure of myelin, and the expression level of myelin proteins. However, unexpectedly, a subset of these conditional Fgfr 2 knock-out mice that are homozygous for cre and therefore are also Cnp 1 null, displayed a dramatic hyperactive behavior starting at � 2 weeks of age. This hyperactivity was abolished by treatment with dopamine receptor antagonists or catecholamine biosynthesis inhibitors, suggesting that the symptoms involve a dysregulation of the dopaminergic system.

40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{characterized}} a positive regulatory region located in the first intron of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene. We show that the enhancer activity of the region depends on a 44 bp sequence centered on a CACCC motif. The sequence is {{the target of the}} two zinc fingers transcription factors BKLF and YY 1. The introduction of a mutation destroying the CACCC box impairs the binding of BKLF but improves that of YY 1. Moreover, the mutated sequence behaves as a negative control element, suggesting that BKLF behaves as a positive factor and that YY 1 is a negative one. We also demonstrate the existence of a novel, tissue-specific AFP mRNA isoform present in the yolk sac and fetal liver which initiates from an alternative promoter located approximately 100 bp downstream of the enhancer element. The transcriptional start site controlled by this new promoter (called P 2), was mapped to 66 bp downstream of a TATA box. A putative AUG translation site in-frame with exon 2 of the classical gene was found 295 bp downstream of the transcription start site. Like the traditional AFP promoter (P 1), the P 2 promoter is active in the yolk sac and fetal liver.

40|$|With the {{development}} of several new technologies using synthetic biology, {{it is possible to}} engineer genetically intractable organisms including Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies capri (Mmc), by cloning the intact bacterial genome in yeast, using the host yeast’s genetic tools to modify the cloned genome, and subsequently transplanting the modified genome into a recipient cell to obtain mutant cells encoded by the modified genome. The recently described tandem repeat coupled with endonuclease cleavage (TREC) method has been successfully used to generate seamless deletions and point mutations in the mycoplasma genome using the yeast DNA repair machinery. But, attempts to <b>knock-in</b> <b>genes</b> in some cases have encountered a high background of transformation due to maintenance of unwanted circularization of the transforming DNA, which contains possible autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) activity. To overcome this issue, we incorporated a split marker system into the TREC method, enabling seamless <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> with high efficiency. The modified method is called TREC-assisted <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> (TREC-IN). Since a gene to be knocked-in is delivered by a truncated non-functional marker, the background caused by an incomplete integration is essentially eliminated. In this paper, we demonstrate applications of the TREC-IN method in gene complementation and genome minimization studies in Mmc. In the first example, the Mmc dnaA gene was seamlessly replaced by an orthologous gene, which shares a high degree of identity at the nucleotide level with the original Mmc gene, with high efficiency and low background. In the minimization example, we replaced an essential gene back into the genome that was present {{in the middle of a}} cluster of non-essential genes, while deleting the non-essential gene cluster, again with low backgrounds of transformation and high efficiency. Conclusion Although we have demonstrated the feasibility of TREC-IN in gene complementation and genome minimization studies in Mmc, the applicability of TREC-IN ranges widely. This method proves to be a valuable genetic tool that can be extended for genomic engineering in other genetically intractable organisms, where it may be implemented in elucidating specific metabolic pathways and in rationale vaccine design...|$|R

We used a one-step double <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> and site-specific <b>gene</b> knock-out strategy.

40|$|Background: Clostridium acetobutylicum is a gram-positive, spore-forming, {{anaerobic}} bacterium {{capable of}} converting various sugars and polysaccharides into solvents (acetone, butanol, and ethanol). The sequencing of its genome has prompted {{new approaches to}} genetic analysis, functional genomics, and metabolic engineering to develop industrial strains {{for the production of}} biofuels and bulk chemicals. Results: The method used in this paper to knock-out or <b>knock-in</b> <b>genes</b> in C. acetobutylicum combines the use of an antibiotic-resistance gene for the deletion or replacement of the target gene, the subsequent elimination of the antibiotic-resistance gene with the flippase recombinase system from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a C. acetobutylicum strain that lacks upp, which encodes uracil phosphoribosyl-transferase, for subsequent use as a counter-selectable marker. A replicative vector containing (1) a pIMP 13 origin of replication from Bacillus subtilis that is functional in Clostridia, (2) a replacement cassette consisting of an antibiotic resistance gene (MLS R) flanked by two FRT sequences, and (3) two sequences homologous to selected regions around target DNA sequence was first constructed. This vector was successfully used to consecutively delete the Cac 824 I restriction endonuclease encoding gene (CA_C 1502) and the upp gene (CA_C 2879) in the C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 chromosome. The resulting C. acetobutylicum Δcac 1502 Δupp strain is marker-less, readily transformable without any previous plasmid methylation and can serve as the host for the “marker-less” genetic exchange system. The third gene, CA_C 3535, shown in this study to encode for a type II restriction enzyme (Cac 824 II) that recognizes the CTGAAG sequence, was deleted using an upp/ 5 -FU counter-selection strategy to improve the efficiency of the method. The restriction-less marker-less strain and the method was successfully used to delete two genes (ctfAB) on the pSOL 1 megaplasmid and one gene (ldhA) on the chromosome to get strains no longer producing acetone or l-lactate.

40|$|Here {{we report}} an {{approach}} to generate a knock-in mouse model using an ‘ends-out’ gene replacement vector to substitute the murine Parp- 1 (mParp- 1) coding sequence (32 kb) with its human orthologous sequence (46 kb). Unexpectedly, examination of mutant ES cell clones and mice revealed that site-specific homologous recombination was mimicked in three independently generated ES cell clones by bidirectional extension of the vector homology arms using the endogenous mParp- 1 -flanking sequences as templates. This was followed by adjacent integration of the targeting vector, thus leaving the endogenous mParp- 1 locus functional. A related phenomenon termed ‘ectopic gene targeting’ has so far only been described for ‘ends-in’ integration-type vectors in non-ES cell gene targeting. We provide reliable techniques to detect such ectopic gene targeting which represents an unexpected caveat in mouse genetic engineering {{that should be considered}} in the design and validation strategy of future <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> approaches...|$|R

Sand flies are the primary vector of Leishmania, the causative pathogen of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. Sand flies acquire many microbes from the soil where immature stages develop until emergence as adults. Gram-negative Pantoea agglomerans and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis are two bacteria commonly associated with sand fly populations. Here, I demonstrated that an EGFP- and a GFP-expressing version of these two bacteria localize to different compartments of the midgut; a phenomenon that is achieved, in part, to pH differences found across the length of the gut. Additionally, P. agglomerans is able to selectively induce midgut epithelial apoptosis while B. subtilis does not. This is accompanied by differential immune and homeostasis responses to both bacteria highlighted by immune pathway suppression via the Poor Immune Response upon <b>Knock-in</b> (Pirk) <b>gene.</b> These effects may actually be representative of a broader type of response to bacterial infection that might be present across several insect species. Finally, I demonstrated that during metamorphosis the sand fly relies, at least in part, upon the activation of multiple genes from the autophagy pathway to aid in generating adult tissues. More specifically, I demonstrate, using microscopy, the presence of ATG 6 in the cytoplasm of developing midgut epithelial cells of the sand fly pupae...|$|R
40|$|Targeted genome {{engineering}} to robustly express transgenes {{is an essential}} methodology for stem cell-based research and therapy. Although designer nucleases {{have been used to}} drastically enhance gene editing efficiency, targeted addition and stable expression of transgenes to date is limited at single gene/locus and mostly PPP 1 R 12 C/AAVS 1 in human stem cells. Here we constructed transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) targeting the safe-harbor like gene CLYBL to mediate reporter gene integration at 38 %- 58 % efficiency, and used both AAVS 1 -TALENs and CLYBL-TALENs to simultaneously <b>knock-in</b> multiple reporter <b>genes</b> at dual safe-harbor loci in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). The CLYBL-TALEN engineered cell lines maintained robust reporter expression during self-renewal and differentiation, and revealed that CLYBL targeting resulted in stronger transgene expression and less perturbation on local gene expression than PPP 1 R 12 C/AAVS 1. TALEN-mediated CLYBL engineering provides improved transgene expression and options for multiple genetic modification in human stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Missense {{mutation}} R 192 Q in the CACNA 1 A gene causes familial {{hemiplegic migraine}} type- 1 (FHM 1), a monogenic subtype of migraine with aura. Using <b>knock-in</b> (KI) <b>gene</b> targeting we introduced this mutation into the mouse gene and generated a {{transgenic mouse model}} to investigate basic mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology. While FHM 1 R 192 Q KI trigeminal ganglia were previously shown to exhibit constitutive up-regulation of ATP-gated P 2 X 3 receptors, {{little is known about}} the firing properties of trigeminal sensory neurons, which convey nociceptive inputs to higher brain centers. We patch-clamped trigeminal sensory neurons to search for differences in firing properties between wildtype (WT) and KI cells in culture. Although various subclasses of trigeminal neurons were observed with respect to their firing patterns evoked by intracellular current injection, their distribution among WT and KI cells was similar with only small differences in rheobase or input resistance values. However, when neurons were excited by either α,β-methyl-ATP to stimulate P 2 X 3 receptors or capsaicin to activate transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV 1) receptors, the firing threshold in KI neurons was significantly lowered and followed by a larger number of spikes. Activation by α,β-methyl-ATP was associated with a transient cluster of action potentials, while capsaicin elicited more persistent firing. Using α,β-methyl-ATP or capsaicin, two functional classes of WT or KI neurons were distinguished according to the first spike latency, which suggests that a subgroup of neurons may be indirectly activated, probably via crosstalk between neurons and satellite glial cells. Thus, our results are consistent with reported facilitated trigeminal pain behavior of FHM 1 R 192 Q KI mice. © 2014 IBRO...|$|R
30|$|The {{clustered}} regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) system, an RNA-guided DNA targeting technology, is {{triggering a}} revolution in the field of biology. CRISPR/Cas 9 has demonstrated great potential for genetic manipulation. In this review, we discuss the current development of CRISPR/Cas 9 technologies for therapeutic applications, especially chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy. Different methods used to facilitate efficient CRISPR delivery and gene editing in T cells are compared. The potential of genetic manipulation using CRISPR/Cas 9 system to generate universal CAR T cells and potent T cells that are resistant to exhaustion and inhibition is explored. We also address the safety concerns {{associated with the use of}} CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing and provide potential solutions and future directions of CRISPR application in the field of CAR T cell immunotherapy. As an integration-free gene insertion method, CRISPR/Cas 9 holds great promise as an efficient <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> platform. Given the tremendous progress that has been made in the past few years, we believe that the CRISPR/Cas 9 technology holds immense promise for advancing immunotherapy.|$|R
40|$|Although {{results from}} {{preclinical}} studies in animal models have proven the concept {{for use of}} anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4) antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, 2 major obstacles have hindered their successful application for human cancer therapy. First, the lack of in vitro correlates of the antitumor effect of the antibodies {{makes it difficult to}} screen for the most efficacious antibody by in vitro analysis. Second, significant autoimmune side effects have been observed in a recent clinical trial. In order to address these 2 issues, we have generated human CTLA 4 <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> mice and used them to compare a panel of anti–human CTLA- 4 antibodies for their ability to induce tumor rejection and autoimmunity. Surprisingly, while all antibodies induced protection against cancer and demonstrated some autoimmune side effects, the antibody that induced the strongest protection also induced the least autoimmune side effects. These results demonstrate that autoimmune disease does not quantitatively correlate with cancer immunity. Our approach may be generally applicable to the development of human therapeutic antibodies...|$|R
