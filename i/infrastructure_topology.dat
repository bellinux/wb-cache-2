40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we study}} a {{two-level}} non-cooperative game between providers {{acting on the}} same geographic area. Each provider {{has the opportunity to}} set up a network of stations so as to capture as many consumers as possible. Its deployment being costly, the provider has to optimize both the number of settled stations as well as their locations. In the first level each provider optimizes independently his <b>infrastructure</b> <b>topology</b> while in the second level they price dynamically the access to their network of stations. The consumers' choices depend on the perception (in term of price, congestion and distances to the nearest stations) that they have of the service proposed by each provider. Each provider market share is then obtained as the solution of a fixed point equation since the congestion level is supposed to depend on the market share of the provider which increases with the number of consumers choosing the same provider. We prove that the two-stage game admits a unique equilibrium in price at any time instant. An algorithm based on the cross-entropy method is proposed to optimize the providers' <b>infrastructure</b> <b>topology</b> and it is tested on numerical examples providing economic interpretations...|$|E

The paper presents a study {{of the performance of}} a WLAN whose <b>infrastructure's</b> <b>topology</b> is such that the access point is in charge of broadcasting the beacon frames. Thus, it is more realistic than previous studies, because beacon frames are usually transmitted in order to announce control information and network identity. Furthermore, in the coverage area, user stations are likely to be working at different data rates, depending on their signal quality. Because beacon frames must be received by all stations, they are transmitted at the lowest data rate operating in the coverage area.

In this paper we therefore describe several statistical and algorithmic approaches for the analysis of infrastructure interdependencies which can take into account not only abstract inter dependencies but also selected properties of infrastructure types such as buffering of resources.

Moreover, it is imperative to identify quickly the key decisions affected by a runtime change that are critical for a system’s mission.

40|$|Infrastructure {{networks}} are complex, interconnected, and inter-dependent systems on which modern society {{has become almost}} totally dependent. They provide for cost-effective and efficient distribution of energy, communications, and transportation, yet are increasingly fragile and rapidly propagate failure caused by natural or man-made hazards. Despite our reliance on these networks and our awareness of their risks, an understanding of their survivability and methods for mitigating the risks inherent in their spatial and topologic organization has been lacking. Infrastructure sensor {{networks are}} coupled with infrastructure for health, performance, or surveillance monitoring. They detect the precursors of hazards and allow response to prevent cascading failure. These co-located, dependent sensor networks are themselves susceptible to disruption and require control methodologies to maintain surveillance capability (i. e, survivability) should disruption occur. This research quantifies the risk and vulnerability associated with dependent sensor networks and investigates the role of topology control and self-organization behavior in mitigating that risk. Simulated random and targeted attacks are performed on spatial and lifeline <b>infrastructure</b> <b>topologies.</b> Spatial topologies are shown to exhibit attack resistance, while lifeline topologies undergo percolation sooner and more frequently resulting in significantly higher vulnerability. Topology control, or dynamic reconfiguration of the network in response to disruption, is shown to significantly mitigate the vulnerability of infrastructure sensor networks. Its application, however, is limited based on the critical spatial density of nodes placed around infrastructure networks. The critical density of dependent sensor networks is computed and a framework for the self-organization of infrastructure sensor networks is discussed...|$|R

These networks do not have a central authority for the management of the network. Here hosts rely on each other to keep the network connected. As the topology of the ad-hoc network is dynamic and every transmission is on the air these networks become vulnerable to number of attacks and security becomes a major issue.

The proposed scheme uses the benefit of a node for joining a network as a function of its transmission power. However, the energy consumption of the nodes also depends on the volume of transferred traffic. A new objective function which takes into account both load and transmission power is described. For evaluating the energy efficiency of the communications, the energy usage of nodes is calculated. For global methods, each node is aware of the whole information about the connectivity of all other nodes. On the other hand, every node is only aware of topological information about nodes within a limited hop distance in local methods. Significant energy efficiency is obtained when each node merely removes one link. Local methods outperform the global methods in terms of energy efficiency.|$|E

This paper presents a study of performance parameters of more realistic networks. We focus the attention on WLAN with infrastructure networks, where the traffic distribution is asymmetric.
