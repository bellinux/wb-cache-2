For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a <b>Digital</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Processing</b> projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E

40|$|The {{explosion}} of {{light emitting diode}} (LED) and liquid crystal display (LCD) screens into our lives has {{had a significant impact}} not only on the availability and portability of media and information, but also on our relationship with light. This article considers an exploration of the relationship between dancer, designer and light and the question is asked; how is <b>digital</b> <b>light</b> a new voice in performance? From this discussion thepaper proposes an approach to lighting design that acknowledges the voice of <b>digital</b> <b>lighting</b> and its ability to communicate both through luminance and mediatized content. <b>Digital</b> <b>light</b> has the potential to significantly affect spatial and communication experiences for both the viewer and the performer. In its ability to both illuminate other spaces as well as define its own through content, <b>digital</b> <b>lighting</b> speaks to us not only of the spaces it inhabits, but also of spaces it can create. In exploring this duality, the work of Massumi is brought into the discussion. Massumi proposes that tracing the pathway of movement opens up opportunities to re-trace, to take a retrospective journey along the trajectory and that this can create, by feedback, new notions of movement.
