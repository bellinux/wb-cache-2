2500|$|Captively bred hybrid falcons {{have been}} {{available}} since the late 1970s, and enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in North America and the UK in the 1990s. Hybrids were initially [...] "created" [...] to combine the horizontal speed {{and size of the}} gyrfalcon with the good disposition and aerial ability of the peregrine. [...] Hybrid falcons first gained large popularity throughout the Arabian Peninsula, feeding a demand for particularly large and aggressive female falcons capable and willing to take on the very large <b>houbara</b> bustard, the classic falconry quarry in the deserts of the Middle East. [...] These falcons were also very popular with Arab falconers as they tended to withstand a respiratory disease (aspergillosis from the mold strain aspergillus) in stressful desert conditions better than other pure species from the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|Falconry is {{currently}} practiced {{in many countries}} around the world. [...] The falconer's traditional choice of bird is the northern goshawk and peregrine falcon. In contemporary falconry in both North America and the UK they remain popular, although the Harris hawk and red-tailed hawk are likely more widely used. [...] The northern goshawk and the golden eagle are more commonly used in Eastern Europe than elsewhere. [...] In the Middle East, the saker falcon is the most traditional species flown against the <b>houbara</b> bustard, sandgrouse, stone-curlew, other birds and hares. Peregrines and other captively bred imported falcons are also commonplace. Falconry remains {{an important part of}} the Arab heritage and culture. [...] The UAE reportedly spends over 27 million dollars annually towards the protection and conservation of wild falcons, and has set up several state-of-the-art falcon hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is the largest falcon hospital in the whole world. [...] There are two breeding farms in the Emirates, as well as those in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. [...] Every year, falcon beauty contests and demonstrations take place at the ADIHEX exhibition in Abu Dhabi.|$|E
5000|$|The Action Plan {{published}} in 1995 estimated {{the total population}} of Canarian <b>houbaras</b> at about 700-750 birds, comprising 300-350 on Fuerteventura and Lobos, and 400 on Lanzarote and Graciosa. [...] However a later study estimated the number of birds on Fuerteventura at 177. [...] Although they are classified as endangered on the Spanish Bird Red List, and are protected by legislation, they are threatened by several factors, including habitat destruction from development, increased disturbance from tourism, illegal hunting, collisions with powerlines and disturbance by truffle collectors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Houbaras</b> are {{restricted}} to the islands of Fuerteventura, Lobos, Lanzarote and Graciosa, though it is uncertain {{as to whether they}} continue to exist on Lobos. In the past they also inhabited the islands of Tenerife and Gran Canaria, where they are now extinct. Annual rainfall in their range is less than 140 mm while mean monthly temperatures range between 16°C in January-February and 24°C in August-September. [...] They inhabit semi-arid plains, rocky hills and immobile dunes, sparsely vegetated with bushes and grasses. They will sometimes feed in farmland in the early morning and at dusk, but avoid human settlements, cornfields, forests and lava flows.|$|R
50|$|International Fund for <b>Houbara</b> Conservation (IFHC) is {{a global}} {{organisation}} dedicated to the restoration and preservation of the <b>Houbara</b> bustard, a vulnerable bird. The Fund oversees a network of affiliated global <b>Houbara</b> bustard conservation projects and <b>Houbara</b> captive breeding programmes, as the <b>Houbara</b> bustard is significant to Arabian heritage and culture.|$|E
50|$|The IFHC {{manages a}} network of {{dedicated}} research and breeding centres across the global distribution range of the <b>Houbara,</b> from which it breeds two species of <b>Houbara</b> bustard - the North African <b>Houbara</b> and the Asian <b>Houbara</b> (the latter including migrant and resident populations which are managed separately), in order to restore and establish sustainable wild populations of <b>Houbara</b> bustard.|$|E
50|$|The IFHC practises {{ecological}} and scientific research to reinforce existing <b>Houbara</b> bustard populations and to reintroduce the <b>Houbara</b> bustard species {{so as to}} make their populations sustainable.|$|E
50|$|Producing over 5,000 Asian <b>Houbara</b> in {{its first}} year of operation, the centre has {{increased}} its production capacity, with its total breeding figure today standing close to 26,000 <b>Houbara.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed <b>Houbara</b> Reintroduction Project, {{managed by}} the IFHC, sees a number of captive bred <b>Houbara</b> {{released}} into the wild in order to reinforce the population. Releases take place across the <b>Houbara</b> range, with past releases having {{taken place in the}} countries of the GCC such as Jordan and Kuwait, to Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|The late President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in {{response}} to this alarming development, believed that the survival of the <b>Houbara</b> was essential for future generations, therefore he established the first captive-breeding programme for the <b>Houbara</b> in the late seventies. Designed to reinstate the close-to-extinct regional population of the <b>Houbara,</b> the seeds of the IFHC were sown.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the IFHC’s second {{breeding}} centre {{located in}} the UAE began in 2010. The Sheikh Khalifa <b>Houbara</b> Breeding Centre, Abu Dhabi (SKHBC-AD) is located in Saih Al Salam, in the eastern region of the emirate, close by to NARC. Operational since 2012, IFHC built its second UAE based breeding centre to support {{the increase in the}} production capacity of captive bred <b>Houbara,</b> to reintroduce <b>Houbara</b> worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The IFHC {{currently}} manages programmes at the National Avian Research Centre (NARC) in Sweihan Abu Dhabi, the Emirates Centre for Wildlife Propagation (ECWP) in Missour, Morocco, the Sheikh Khalifa <b>Houbara</b> Breeding Centre in Kazakhstan and {{a second}} centre in Abu Dhabi, the Sheikh Khalifa <b>Houbara</b> Breeding Centre at Seih Al Salem. IFHC also has agreements in place with other countries along the Asian <b>Houbara</b> migratory route.|$|E
50|$|The Emirates Centre for Wildlife Propagation (ECWP) {{opened a}} primary {{breeding}} centre in Missour, Morocco in 1995 {{focusing on the}} North African <b>Houbara</b> bustard. The facilities provide {{the full range of}} <b>Houbara</b> conservation activities.|$|E
50|$|Threats to <b>Houbara</b> {{bustards}} include hunting it for food. The North African <b>houbara</b> bustard {{declined in}} {{populations in the}} two decades before 2004, but unlike its near relative the Asian <b>houbara</b> or MacQueen's bustard, {{has been on the}} increase since. Although hunted both by falconers and by hunters with guns, the extent is much less than that faced by MacQueen's bustard {{in the middle east and}} west Asia.|$|E
50|$|IFHC {{recognizes that}} the {{participation}} of all stakeholders, which include conservationists, hunters and those whose action affect {{the survival of the}} <b>Houbara</b> bustard are required to achieve long-term conservation goals and conserve the <b>Houbara</b> bustard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Houbara</b> bustard {{spends most}} of its time on the ground {{foraging}} for food. It is omnivorous and opportunistic; its diet consisting of plants, seeds, insects, spiders, small rodents and lizards. Adaption to its arid habitat enables the <b>Houbara</b> to obtain enough of its fluid from food and it seldom needs to drink water. <b>Houbara</b> feed mostly at sunrise or dusk. Adult birds are mainly solitary, but can forage in small groups according to {{the period of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|Migratory and {{resident}} populations of <b>Houbara</b> bustard have long existed on the Arabian Peninsula, where for centuries they {{played an important}} role in the survival of the indigenous people who lived in the harsh desert climate. Owing to the practice of hunting with falcons, the <b>Houbara</b> served as an important source of sustenance for these desert-dwellers. Today, this ancient practice dates back some several thousand years, and has thus transformed the <b>Houbara</b> bustard into an important symbol of Arabian heritage and culture.|$|E

50|$|Work was {{initiated}} in 2008 on the Sheikh Khalifa <b>Houbara</b> Breeding Center (SKHBC) near Shymkent in southern Kazakhstan, for breeding and monitoring migratory Asian <b>Houbara</b> bustard. Although the centre {{is not working}} at full capacity yet, it has established a foundation stock of birds for breeding.|$|E
50|$|The <b>houbara</b> bustard or North African <b>houbara</b> (Chlamydotis undulata) {{is a large}} bird in the bustard family. This bustard {{is found}} in arid {{habitats}} spread across northern Africa and Southeast Asia with a population on the Canary Islands. They are dull brown with black markings on the wings with a greyish neck and a black ruff {{along the side of}} the neck. Males and females appear very similar but males are larger and heavier. This species formerly included MacQueen's bustard which is found further east and sometimes known as the Asian <b>houbara</b> as a subspecies.|$|E
50|$|In January 2014, Prince Fahad hunted 2100 {{endangered}} <b>houbara</b> bustards in Chagai, Balochistan, Pakistan. He {{hunted for}} 21 days - from 11 January to 31 January 2014- and hunted 1,977 birds, while {{other members of}} his party hunted an additional 123 birds, bringing the total bustard toll to 2,100 (roughly 2% of remaining population). The <b>houbara</b> bustard is listed as an endangered species; hunting it is completely banned in Pakistan. In Pakistan hunting the <b>houbara</b> is only by special permit for visiting royalty. Such permits allow for a maximum total bag of 100 birds which must not be hunted in reserved areas. The Prince reportedly hunted extensively in reserved areas. The <b>houbara</b> is widely prized in Arabia as a quarry for falconers particularly because its meat is valued as an aphrodisiac.|$|E

50|$|The {{first years}} of the {{breeding}} programme involved education initiatives to understand the behaviour of the targeted <b>Houbara</b> bustard population so it could be bred in captivity. Breeding <b>Houbara</b> in captivity is a long and complex process. Only a complete artificial reproduction process can contribute to a significant captive production.|$|E
50|$|The International Fund for <b>Houbara</b> Conservation (IFHC) was {{established}} in 2006 in Abu Dhabi to continue the conservation legacy of the late President. Today the Fund is responsible for a global network of sustainable initiatives aimed at reinstating <b>Houbara</b> bustard numbers worldwide. It achieves this through captive breeding and release programmes.|$|E
50|$|MacQueen's bustard (Chlamydotis macqueenii) {{is a large}} bird in the bustard family. It was earlier {{included}} as a subspecies of the <b>houbara</b> bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) and sometimes known as the Asian <b>houbara.</b> The subspecies are geographically separated from the <b>houbara</b> found west of the Sinai Peninsula in North Africa with a population in the Canary Islands. MacQueen's bustard {{is found in the}} desert and steppe regions of Asia, east from the Sinai Peninsula extending across Kazakhstan east to Mongolia. These two species are the only members of the genus Chlamydotis. MacQueen's is a partial latitudinal migrant while the <b>houbara</b> bustard is more sedentary. In the 19th century, vagrants were found as far west of their range as Great Britain. Populations have decreased by 20 to 50% from 1984 to 2004 due mainly to hunting and land-use changes.|$|E

50|$|Asian <b>Houbara</b> populations {{breeding}} {{in spring}} in Central Asia migrate south in autumn to spend winters in the warmest {{parts of their}} range (Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan). In early spring, they migrate back to their breeding sites of China, Kazakhstan. Some Asian <b>Houbara</b> are resident and breed {{in the southern part}} of the range (Arabian Peninsula, Iran).|$|E
50|$|NARC has {{developed}} a <b>Houbara</b> bustard conservation public awareness programme, for educating young people {{about the plight of}} these vulnerable birds and how to save them. The Fund organises school visits to the NARC facility to introduce children to the <b>Houbara</b> bustard and teach them about its lifecycle, its ecological importance and its place in Arabian heritage.|$|E
50|$|Today, the IFHC {{continues}} {{the work of}} the late President, and has established a global and holistic conservation programme for the <b>Houbara</b> bustard. At its heart is the breeding and release programme, which is supported by the Fund’s work in the fields of education, ecological research, and sustainable community development to reinstate a healthy and sustainable population of <b>Houbara.</b>|$|E
50|$|Researchers at NARC {{monitor the}} {{movements}} of <b>Houbara</b> bustards fitted with tracking devices throughout the bird’s range, from the Middle East through Central Asia. The NARC facility is a main research centre on the Asian <b>Houbara</b> bustard with programmes to monitor and record physiology, genetic profile, and behaviour of this vulnerable bird. Much of the centre’s work is geared to its release programme within the UAE.|$|E
