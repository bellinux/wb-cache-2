40|$|M. Phil. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) There are {{two methods}} {{that can be}} used when power is {{converted}} from one frequency to another. One way uses a DC link as an intermediate stage and the other uses no intermediate stage. When no DC link exists, the conversion process is referred to as AC-AC conversion, (Cha, Enjeti & Ratanapanachote, 2004 : 2237). This method essentially chops the AC signal in a specific manner which yields an AC signal with a different frequency directly. Depending on how the AC signal is chopped, it would result in a varied number of wave shapes are constructed. The construction of these various wave shapes results in devices that can accomplish different tasks. One such device is called a unity <b>displacement</b> <b>factor</b> frequency converter (UDFFC). This research attempts to develop a model, to simulate and design a unity <b>displacement</b> <b>factor</b> frequency converter. The primary idea about this device is that the power factor or <b>displacement</b> <b>factor</b> is unity regardless of the load. There are three parts {{in the development of the}} UDFFC. The power circuit is an array or matrix of switches that link the three phase supply to the three phase load. The power circuit is interfaced to the control circuit which generates pulses that control the matrix of switches. The control circuit utilizes embedded control software that performs the control logic in a microcontroller. The development of the UDFFC has a potential to solve real power engineering problems, such as eliminating the DC link in a converter. This achieves the conversion of AC directly to AC in the absence of a DC link. The other major advantage is the variation of the output frequency to a desired value. The most important is that the <b>displacement</b> <b>factor</b> can be controlled as well...|$|E

Several researchers have tried to investigate the <b>displacement</b> amplification <b>factors</b> of structural systems. Uang and Maarouf (1994) have discussed the effects of building and predominant earthquake ratios, types of yield mechanisms, and structural overstrength on the <b>displacement</b> amplification <b>factor.</b> Kim and Choi (2004) showed that the structural displacements decrease {{with the increase in}} BRB stiffness. They also found that the story-wise distribution of BRB, in proportion to the story drifts and story shears, results in better structural performance. Mahmoudi (2004) evaluated the <b>displacement</b> amplification <b>factor</b> and proposed a value to estimate the maximum lateral structural displacement, without using the nonlinear analysis. He also calculated the ratio of <b>displacement</b> amplification <b>factor</b> and response modification factor. In their study, Kiggins and Uang (2006) found that the use of BRB with steel moment frames will reduce residual story drifts and permanent deformations which can conversely lead to obtaining larger value of response modification factor.|$|R

40|$|Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) {{is a new}} {{paradigm}} for computation that utilizes polarization states instead of using current switching. It is being studied because of {{the realization of the}} quickly approaching limitation of the current CMOS technology. The location of two excess electrons located within four or five quantum dots on a particular cell can transmit the binary information. These dots are located in the corner of a square cell, {{and if there is a}} fifth dot it is located in the center. The electrons are allowed to tunnel freely among the dots, but are restricted from tunneling between neighboring cells. Because of the interaction between the electrons, they will anti-align within the cell giving one of two particular configurations. This configuration can be transmitted to neighboring cells. In other words, data is flowing. We present a numerical study of the fabrication defect's influence on Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) operation. The statistical model that has been introduced simulates the random distribution of positional defects of the dots within cells and of cells within arrays. Missing dots within a QCA cell structure have also been studied. We have studied specific non-clocked QCA devices using the Inter-cellular Hartree Approximation, for different temperatures. Parameters such as success rate and breakdown <b>displacement</b> <b>factor</b> were defined and calculated numerically.
