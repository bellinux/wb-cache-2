40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies on}} team-based {{learning}} (TBL) in medical education demonstrated improved learner engagement, learner satisfaction, and academic performance; however, {{a paucity of}} information exists on modifications of the incentive structure of “traditional” TBL practices. The current study investigates the impact of modification to conventional <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises by examining student preference and student perceptions of TBL outcomes when <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises are excluded from TBL grades. Methods: During the 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011 academic years, 175 students (95. 6 % response rate) completed a 22 -item multiple choice survey followed by 3 open response questions {{at the end of}} their second year of medical school. These students had participated in a TBL supplemented preclinical curriculum with graded <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises during year one and ungraded <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises during year two of medical school. Results: Chi-square analyses showed significant differences between grading categories for general assessment of TBL, participation and communication, intra-team discussion, inter-team discussion, student perceptions of their own effort and development of teamwork skills. Furthermore, 83. 8 % of students polled prefer ungraded <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises with only 7. 2 % preferring graded and 9. 0 % indicating no preference. Conclusion: The use of ungraded <b>Group</b> <b>Application</b> exercises appears to be a successful modification of TBL, making it more “student-friendly” while maintaining the goals of active learning and development of teamwork skills...|$|R

The architecture is intended to encourage a uniform appearance to all <b>group</b> <b>applications</b> to assist in their collective management, whilst being sufficiently flexible to cope with all likely multicast mechanisms upon which such applications may be based. The concept of a media channel is introduced as the application-independent instance of a single application, and becomes the basic unit of management in a group user-agent which therefore manages multiple applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the demand for Future Internet {{services}} with many emerging <b>group</b> <b>applications</b> has driven the development of satellite, which is the preferred delivery mechanism due to its wide area coverage, multicasting capability and speed to deliver affordable future services. Nevertheless, security {{has been one of}} the obstacles for both satellite services as well as smart grid <b>group</b> <b>applications,</b> especially with logical/geographical/cryptographic domains spanning heterogeneous networks and regions. In this paper, adaptive security architecture is implemented to protect satellite services for smart grid <b>group</b> <b>applications.</b> The focus is on key management and policy provisioning. Leveraging Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) as the standard for smart grid centralized key/policy management architecture, a single Domain of Interpretation (DOI) is deployed and evaluated critically in terms of the added protocol signaling overhead on the satellite system for a fixed-network scenario. This also partially realizes the growing trend towards the use of TCP/IP technology for smart grid applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen a {{significant}} increase in the importance of <b>group</b> based distributed <b>applications</b> such as media dissemination, computer supported collaborative work or fault tolerance through replication. However, most distributed object based middleware platforms, which are increasingly being used as an implementation environment for such applications, fail to provide suitable support for <b>group</b> <b>applications</b> in their full generality. In this paper we describe a component based approach to the provision of group services in a middleware environment in which <b>application</b> tailored <b>group</b> services can be built by defining particular configurations of components or by incrementally modifying existing configurations. In addition, our approach uses reflective capabilities of the middleware platform to support the run-time reconfiguration of existing and running <b>group</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R

40|$|Emergence of latest {{technologies}} has diverted {{the focus}} of people form Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) to mobile supported collaborative learning. MCL is highly demanded in educational organizations to substantiate the pedagogical activities. Some of the MCL supportive architectures including applications are introduced in several fields to improve the activities of those organizations, but they need more concise paradigm to support both types of collaboration: synchronous and asynchronous. This paper introduces the new preusability testing method that provides educational support and gives complete picture for developing new pedagogical <b>group</b> <b>application</b> for MCL. The feature of application includes asynchronous and synchronous collaboration support. To validate the features of application, we conduct the post usability testing and heuristic evaluation, which helps in collecting the empirical data to prove the effectiveness and suitability of <b>Group</b> <b>application.</b> Further, application aims to improve learning impact and educate people at anytime and anywhere.
