In many countries anaesthesiologists are today fully involved in teaching and practicing emergency medicine, and have leading role in emergency department. Proper education and effective <b>interdisciplinary</b> medical <b>cooperation</b> is essential for quality assurance in emergency medicine.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the practices of}} interdisciplinary research projects in nine extra-university research institutions in Germany. The research fields of these institutions include representative fields of current interdisciplinary research, such as climate change research, environmental studies, organizational research, and area studies. The analysis shows that the outcome of <b>interdisciplinary</b> research <b>cooperation</b> depends upon the micro-organization of research practices. There is, however, no singular recipe for a successful cooperation. Instead, the case studies show a multiplicity of adequate "styles of interdisciplinarity”: methodological, charismatic, heuristic and pragmatic interdisciplinarity. The differences between them depend upon the organizational and epistemic conditions of research practice...|$|R

Given their small size and related pool of professionals, small and medium enterprises need {{to work very hard}} on their staff’s innovativeness and related personal traits. Making a small and medium enterprise successful must be considered as an invention-innovation-diffusion process that tackles both the businesses mix of the given size, and the small and medium enterprise as an entrepreneurial achievement. Thus, all preconditions concerning both the content and the process of innovation must be considered, which requires the requisite holism and, therefore, systemic rather than one-sided thinking/behavior of the usual specialists. Hence, values/culture/ethics/norms of owners, entrepreneurs, managers and their co-workers must also be innovated along with their knowledge.
