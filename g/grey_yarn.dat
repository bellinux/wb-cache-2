5000|$|The Landlord : Voiced by Liam Lynch. The {{landlord}} for Sifl & Olly's apartment (some episodes, however, {{imply that}} the duo actually live in their studio. It is possible that they simply tape their show in their apartment, but some segments clearly {{imply that the}} two are [...] "not home" [...] during taping). He {{is made out of}} an opaque brown stocking with <b>grey</b> <b>yarn</b> hair and eyebrows. He also has a tattered white sleeve covering most of his body, giving him a disheveled appearance. This is enhanced by the puppeteer, whose knuckles are positioned prominently in the puppet, increasing its aggressive appearance. The Landlord frequently calls during the [...] "Calls to the Public" [...] segments to yell at Sifl and Olly about something they're doing on his property, such as breeding monkeys or building a water slide. He threatens to kick them out regularly, but the duo has already built a moat around their apartment filled with crocodiles and guarded by archer monkeys.|$|E
