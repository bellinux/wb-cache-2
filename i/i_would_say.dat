25|$|Conservative Judaism {{has always}} been premised on the total embrace of {{critical}} inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{that it is a}} mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works {{to the best of our}} abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.|$|E
25|$|We'd see Basie in town, and I was {{impressed}} by Harry Edison and Buck Clayton, being a trumpet player. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> I {{was impressed}} by Dizzy Gillespie {{when he was with}} Cab Calloway. I {{was impressed by}} those three trumpet players of the people I saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.|$|E

25|$|In conclusion, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{that however}} great the {{scientific}} {{importance of this}} discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, {{and that it will}} continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{that this}} problem of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E

I’ve never really had a girlfriend or anything and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>say</b> I’m anything, really. I don’t have an identity in that way.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the start}} of her career, Brandy has named Whitney Houston as her most {{prominent}} music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her “idol”, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, “as a professional musician, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.” She elaborates, saying “She was always the idea for me. I {{wanted to be like}} her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing.” Beginning the late 90’s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood’s “godmother”.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

500|$|Around this time, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} into a microphone onstage, and afterward [...] pull me aside and say, [...] "Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again."

500|$|When {{asked about}} the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: [...] "It's not a rumour, it's based on a story that someone told me.

500|$|Price {{felt that}} all the actors on the set had a {{difficult}} time with the director, explaining: [...] "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There— you're doing it again. Don't do that'." [...] Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.|$|E
500|$|Israel sharply {{condemned}} {{the release of}} the Munich perpetrators and accused West Germany of having [...] "capitulated to terrorism". Prime Minister Golda Meir stated on the following day: [...] "We have been depressed since yesterday, aggrieved and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> insulted, that the human spirit, so weak and helpless, has surrendered to brutal force." [...] Foreign Minister Abba Eban filed an official protest note with the West German government, and the Israeli ambassador in Bonn was temporarily called back, officially due to consultations.|$|E

In the end, he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks through the front door, returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> you're not watching [...] wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{disruption}} {{caused by a}} protestor in the previous year's race, Royal Marines provided support to the security arrangements surrounding the race. Race director David Searle urged nobody to repeat {{the disruption}} of 2012, saying [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to anybody thinking of doing that, is that it's unbelievably dangerous ... We had practised emergency stops and it worked". The manner of any potential restart was modified to allow the race re-commence as soon as practicable. The Metropolitan Police had made contact with the protestor, Trenton Oldfield, to assist him making a more peaceful protest should he wish to do so, but he declined the offer and {{did not attend the}} race in any capacity.|$|E
