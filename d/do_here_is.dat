2500|$|On October 26, 1985, Harbaugh set {{a school}} record with 283 passing yards in a 42–15 victory over Indiana. [...] After the game, Harbaugh was asked for his {{reaction}} to setting the school's passing record and responded, [...] "Records are nice, but everything we <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> team oriented. Everyone's telling me about the record, but they should tell it to Paul Jokisch and Eric Kattus and John Kolesar. [...] They caught the passes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May 1953, Bunin left in {{his diary}} a note {{that proved to be}} his last one. [...] "Still, this is so dumbfoundingly extraordinary. In a very short while {{there will be no more}} of me– and of all the things worldly, of all the affairs and destinies, from then on I will be unaware! And what I'm left to <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> dumbly try to {{consciously}} impose upon myself fear and amazement," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly {{for us to}} see, saying [...] "A gentleman wanted me to tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E

"Old Tom {{calls this}} sort of a wharf his door-yard," [...] {{observed}} Hurry, as he fastened the canoe, after he and his Companion had left it: [...] "and the gallants from the forts have named it the castle court though what a 'court' can have to <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> more than I can tell you, seeing {{that there is no}} law.

And so he did, with sly artifice, which is worse in such hands than a crowbar. And now what are we to <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> Thursday, and {{something}} must be done before Sunday for the souls of those poor benighted creatures at Hogglestock." [...] Mrs. Proudie was ready for the battle, and was even now sniffing the blood afar-off. [...] "I believe it's a hundred and thirty pounds a year," [...] she said, before the bishop had collected his thoughts sufficiently for a reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "In fact, that is {{our family}} department," [...] said Mr. Skimpole, [...] "in this hurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being interested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can we <b>do?</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I dare say her marrying another child, and having two more, was all wrong in point of {{political}} economy, {{but it was very}} agreeable. We had our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social ideas. She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have THEIR nests upstairs too. So we get on, we don't know how, but somehow." ...|$|E

I want to put a particular view of what is happening before you, and what it is that we are up against. I want to put before you for your judgment the view that this overstrain and breaking down and stoppage of the great uprush of civilization that has gone on for the past three centuries is due to the same forces and is the logical outcome of the same forces that led to that uprush, to that tremendous expansion of human knowledge and power and life. And that that breaking up is an inevitable thing unless we meet it by a very great effort of a particular kind.|$|E

For instance, I've been trying lately--induce them to buy their medicines in advance, and in larger quantities. But they won't look for it! Then I tried to float a little notion of mine, sort of an insurance scheme for colds; you pay so much a week, and when you've got a cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus {{so long as you}} can produce a substantial sniff.

6000|$|The Cote Droit {{persists}} no less; nay {{with more}} animation than ever, though hope has now well nigh fled. Tough Abbe Maury, when the obscure country Royalist grasps {{his hand with}} transport of thanks, answers, rolling his indomitable brazen head: [...] "Helas, Monsieur, all that I <b>do</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> as good as simply nothing." [...] Gallant Faussigny, visible this one time in History, advances frantic, {{into the middle of}} the Hall, exclaiming: [...] "There is but one way of dealing with it, and that is to fall sword in hand on those gentry there, sabre a la main sur ces gaillards la," [...] (Moniteur, Seance du 21 Aout, 1790.) franticly indicating our chosen Thirty on the extreme tip of the Left! Whereupon is clangour and clamour, debate, repentance,--evaporation. Things ripen towards downright incompatibility, and what is called 'scission:' that fierce theoretic onslaught of Faussigny's was in August, 1790; next August will not have come, till a famed Two Hundred and Ninety-two, the chosen of Royalism, make solemn final 'scission' from an Assembly given up to faction; and depart, shaking the dust off their feet.|$|E
60|$|For let us {{take the}} whole matter nakedly as it lies before us, without the {{refinements}} of some people, with which {{we have nothing to}} <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> a patent granted under the great seal of England, upon false suggestions, to one William Wood for coining copper halfpence for Ireland: The Parliament here, upon apprehensions of the worst consequences from the said patent, address the King to have it recalled; this is refused, and a committee of the Privy-council report to His Majesty, that Wood has performed the conditions of his patent. He then is left to do the best he can with his halfpence; no man being obliged to receive them; the people here, being likewise left to themselves, unite as one man, resolving they will {{have nothing to do with}} his ware. By this plain account of the fact it is manifest, that the King and his ministry are wholly out of the case, and the matter is left to be disputed between him and us. Will any man therefore attempt to persuade me, that a Lord Lieutenant is to be dispatched over in great haste before the ordinary time, and a Parliament summoned by anticipating a prorogation, merely to put an hundred thousand pounds into the pocket of a sharper, by the ruin of a most loyal kingdom.|$|E

"He {{was always}} a 'dandy nigger,'" [...] {{returned}} Pendleton, his face slightly relaxing as he glanced after his grizzled henchman, [...] "but his exaggeration of courtesy is a blank sight more natural and manly than the exaggeration of discourtesy which your superior civilized 'helps' think is self-respect. The excuse of servitude of any kind is its spontaneity and affection. When you know a man hates you and serves you from interest, you know he's a cur and you're a tyrant. It's your blank progress that's made menial service degrading by teaching men to avoid it. Why, sir, when I first arrived here, Jack Hammersley and myself took turns as cook to the party. I didn't consider myself any the worse master for it. But enough of this." [...] He paused, and, raising himself on his elbow, gazed for some seconds half cautiously, half doubtfully, upon his companion. [...] "I've got something to tell you, Hathaway," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "You've had an easy time with this Trust; your share of the work hasn't worried you, kept you awake nights, or interfered with your career. I understand perfectly," [...] he continued, in reply to Hathaway's deprecating gesture. [...] "I accepted to act as your proxy, and I HAVE. I'm not complaining. But it is time that you should know what I've done, and what you may still have to <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> the record. On {{the day after that}} interview in the Mayor's office, the El Dorado Bank, of which I was, and still am, president, received seventy-five thousand dollars in trust from Mrs. Howard. Two years afterwards, on that same day, the bank had, by lucky speculations, increased that sum to the credit of the trust one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or double the original capital. In the following year the bank suspended payment." ...|$|E
