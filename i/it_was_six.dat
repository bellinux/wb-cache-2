25|$|Collishaw's {{next two}} {{victories}} were properly witnessed {{by thousands of}} French troops. He was ferrying a new aircraft from Wing Headquarters when six enemies dived out of the clouds and attacked him. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> to one, and the Germans {{had the advantage of}} height. Collishaw, like Barker and McKeever, was happiest when close to the ground in such a spot. He went down. At tree-top level the advantage of numbers meant much less. In two quick bursts, he sent two Albatroses crashing into the trees, after which the others flew off. The flight so impressed the French that they awarded him the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{clear-cut}} incision on the neck. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> {{inches in length}} and commenced {{two and a half}} inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, one half inch in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two inches below the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Dale A. Russell, then {{curator of}} {{vertebrate}} fossils at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for Stenonychosaurus, {{if it had}} not perished in the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted {{that there had been a}} steady increase in the encephalization quotient or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in Stenonychosaurus evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100cm3, comparable to that of a human.|$|E
25|$|The {{contentious}} new railway between Muiredge Den and Methil {{was started}} in October 1899; it was completed and opened in January 1901. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> miles in length, and single track, starting in the west at Duncan siding, linking Lochhead and Hugo pits, with a new east-facing connection to Michael. It then crossed the Wemyss and Buckhaven line and turned north up Wemyss Den, running close to the 1887 Wellsgreen line, then crossing it by a diamond crossing; the earlier restrictive agreements required Wellsgreen traffic to be worked to Wemyss Castle. It then ran north and east, joining the Bowman branch to Isabella pit, and then crossing {{the route of the}} NBR Muiredge branch. Running north-south this had become dormant when more direct routes for Muiredge coal had been built, and the NBR had agreed that it might be severed to allow the new line to pass through west to east. Spur connections north and south were made to the stubs of that line; the junction area was known as Muiredge Plunks. The line continued east through Starkey's Wood, turning tightly to the south-west and crossing over the Methil extension railway, to terminate at Denbeath pit on the shore.|$|E
