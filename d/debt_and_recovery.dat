50|$|In 1913, Pollard campaigned {{to become}} Virginia's Attorney General against two Martin {{organization}} candidates (S.W. Williams and S.G. Cummings). They divided the organization vote and Pollard (who advocated election law reform, increased public education funding, and abolition of fee-based compensation of public officials) narrowly won the Democratic primary. He then easily won {{the general election}} in November, alongside Governor Henry C. Stuart and Lieutenant Governor J. Taylor Ellyson. He took office in January 1914 and the following month {{became president of the}} Progressive Virginia Democratic League. Pollard campaigned for Prohibition, and Virginia went dry in September 1914. The attorney general also cracked down on gambling and vice in Norfolk, Hopewell and Colonial Beach. His successful conclusion of the lawsuit against West Virginia relating to pre-Civil War <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> of Martha Washington's will from J.P.

40|$|November 17, 2008 Recently {{because of}} Basel II and the {{subprime}} mortgage crisis, the quantification of recovery size and recovery {{rate for the}} debt of a defaulted company {{is a serious problem}} for financial institutions and their supervision, but there has been no study of structure of recovery process. Existent recovery models do not regard recovery progress before the time of achievement of recovery. We directly model recovery process for the debt of a single defaulted company. We model the recovery process by a homogeneous compound Poisson process and extend our model to an inhomogeneous compound Poisson process. Interest rate is explicitly used in our model. By our model, the relationship between cumulative recovery, the increment of recovery, the initial debt amount, the last recovery possible time and interest rate can be analyzed. We derive the expectation and the variance of the survival value of the <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> rate, and also derive the probability distribution function and the expectation of the recovery completion time. For this paper we present the numerical methods of calculating the expectation and the variance based on Panjer recursion formula and the fast Fourier transformation, and give numerical result. The methods of calculating the transition density of an inhomogeneous compound Poisson process is necessary for calculating the expectation and the variance of those in the inhomogeneous compound Poisson model, however little attention has been given to such methods. Therefore we propose the new procedure for calculating it by a piecewise homogeneous compound Poisson process...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} is to apply a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network technique to create classification models from a portfolio of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) to classify this type of credit derivative.

Since these titles are, because of legislative motives, moved by losses, Credit Rights Investment Funds (FDIC) performs the purchase of these <b>debts</b> <b>and</b> the <b>recovery</b> of the credits. Using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), classification models regarding the posterior recovery of these debts were created. To evaluate the performance of the models, evaluation metrics of classification relating to the neural networks with different architectures were presented. The results of the classifications were satisfactory, given the classification models were successful in the presented economics costs structure...|$|R

There are two key findings: First, bank behavior and other institutional factors, and not the nature of stakeholder orientation, seem to explain variations in capital structures and the depth of recessions across economies. Second, aspects of insolvency procedures favoring rehabilitation of “financially distressed” firms seem to explain well the expected duration of the crisis. ...|$|R

40|$|As is well known, most {{models of}} credit risk {{have failed to}} measure the credit risks {{in the context of}} the global {{financial}} crisis. In this context, financial industry representatives, regulators and academics worldwide have given new impetus to efforts to improve credit risk modeling for countries, corporations, financial institutions, and financial instruments. The paper summarizes some of the recent advances in this regard. It considers modifications of structural models, including of the classical Merton model, and efforts to reconcile the structural and the reduced-form models. It also discusses the reassessment of the default correlations using copulas, the pricing of credit index options, and the determination of the prices of distressed <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> estimation of <b>recovery</b> values...|$|R
40|$|Zimbabwe has the {{uncommon}} {{combination of}} a high public deficit, a balanced current account, low inflation, {{and low levels of}} investment and growth. Despite a surplus in the current account, the nonfinancial public sector has run deficits exceeding 10 percent of GDP since 1981. Inflation is low but interest rates are rising because of partial financial liberalization and rising domestic public debt stocks. Heavy public spending crowded out private consumption and investment in the 1980 s. The private saving rate is a staggering 20 percent of GDP, which finances all of Zimbabwe's investment. The fiscal adjustment begun in 1987 helped stabilize the public <b>debt</b> <b>and</b> improved <b>recovery</b> of investment. But more fiscal adjustment is needed to improve macroeconomic and financial stability and growth prospects. Public deficits must be reduced to ensure a sustainable path for public debt. High deficits are crowding out both private consumption and private investment. The public sector must be adjusted and foreign trade must be reformed to improve capital formation - a prerequisite for improving growth prospects in Zimbabwe.

40|$|The authors {{develop and}} apply a {{macroeconomic}} {{general equilibrium model}} for Zimbabwe. The model integrates a behavioral estimated model structure, taken from a companion paper, with the relevant budget constraints for a six-sector disaggregation into a comprehensive framework. Starting with 1988 as a base year, the authorssent simulations for a base scenario covering the period 1988 - 1995. From the different macroeconomic issues and reform requirements identified in the companion paper as relevant for Zimbabwe today, they select two for performing alternative scenario simulations here: {{a continuation of the}} current oil shock and strong fiscal stabilization. The oil shock is shown to reduce growth, increase inflation, depreciate the real exchange rate, and reduce private investment in Zimbabwe, a country heavily dependent on imported oil. Fiscal adjustment is a major challenge for stabilization and growth faced by Zimbabwe's policy-makers today. The paper's simulations show that deep fiscal reform will significantly help Zimbabwe achieve a sustainable debt path, a decline in interest rates paid on public <b>debt,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>recovery</b> of private consumption and investment.
