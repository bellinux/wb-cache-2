40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{examined}} the relationship between awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> occupational performance in a group of elderly persons during the year after stroke. METHOD. Data on awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> occupational performance (i. e., activities of daily living [ADL] motor and process ability) were collected 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after stroke. A mixed-linear-effects model was implemented {{to examine the relationship between}} awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> ADL motor and process ability over time. RESULTS. Increased awareness of disability was related to improvements in occupational performance (ADL motor and process ability). The 2 relationships were different, with a positive linear relationship between awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> ADL motor ability, and a stronger, positive, nonlinear relationship between awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> ADL process ability. CONCLUSION. Clients’ awareness of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> their ability to perform occupations should be assessed several times during a rehabilitation process so that interventions can be adjusted to match each client’s potential to benefit from them...|$|R

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E

5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960.

As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Research has {{increasingly}} {{focused on the}} dynamic nature of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms in later life. Little research, however, has modeled <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms as dynamic, related processes. Furthermore, virtually no research has considered social support as dynamic across age. Here, we investigate the relationship between long-term patterns of <b>disability,</b> perceived <b>and</b> received social support, and depressive symptoms in later life. Methods. We use random coefficient (growth) models of four waves of Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly data to determine whether <b>disability,</b> support, <b>and</b> depressive symptoms follow linear trajectories across age and whether support mediates the relationship between <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms. Results. The results show that (a) trajectories of disability are strongly related to trajectories of depressive symptoms and (b) trajectories of perceived support mediate the relationship between trajectories of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms, whereas trajectories of received support do not. Discussion. <b>Disability,</b> social support, <b>and</b> depressive symptoms are strongly interrelated processes in later life. Our {{results are consistent with}} previous research in showing that perceived, rather than received, support mediates the relationship between <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms, but our results extend previous research in showing that this mediation occurs across time...|$|R

5|$|Unaided AAC {{systems are}} {{those that do not}} require an {{external}} tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, gestures, and sign languages and systems. Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities. More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on Plains Indian Sign Language, and has been used with children with severe-profound <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> adults with a variety of diagnoses including dementia, aphasia and dysarthria. The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.|$|E

5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC.

The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with <b>disabilities,</b> <b>and</b> the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} progression and prognostic {{factors of}} progression rate of motor impairment, <b>disability,</b> <b>and</b> {{quality of life}} (QoL) in patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Methods: A group of 126 patients with newly diagnosed PD recruited from outpatient clinics participated in this 3 -year prospective cohort study. Motor impairment was rated with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Motor-Examination. Disability was rated using the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale, the AMC Linear Disability Score. QoL was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire. Linear mixed model {{analyses were conducted to}} identify determinants of progression rate of motor impairment, <b>disability,</b> <b>and</b> poor QoL. Results: Motor impairment progressed with 3 points per year. There was a slight progression of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> QoL during 3 years of follow-up. Female sex was a prognostic factor for slower progression of motor impairment and QoL. Older age at onset showed to prognosticate faster progression of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> impaired QoL. Furthermore, independent of follow-up time, older age at onset was associated with worse motor impairment; nondopaminergic reactive symptoms (Axial impairment) were associated with more <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> poorer QoL; comorbidity showed relation with <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> QoL but to a lesser extent; self-reported mood symptoms were associated with poorer QoL; and disease duration correlated with motor impairment. Conclusions: Motor impairment, <b>disability,</b> <b>and</b> QoL of newly diagnosed Parkinson patients show progression in the first 3 years. Older age at onset predicts worse progression rate of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> impaired QoL over time. Female sex predicts slower progression of motor impairment and less decline of QoL.
