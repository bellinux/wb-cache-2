5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map describes it {{as a set of}} branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E
5|$|One {{account of}} a woman being {{admitted}} to Freemasonry in the 18th century <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth Aldworth (born St Leger), who {{is reported to have}} surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile House, the private house of her father, first Viscount Doneraile, a resident of Doneraile, County Cork, Ireland. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing. Speculative attempts to link the lodge of her initiation with a documented lodge of the Grand Lodge of Ireland have proved futile, but there is no reason that her father should not have instituted a lodge in his home, and the authenticity of her initiation is generally accepted.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} the park comes from the {{uncontrolled}} tourist development which has plagued the Bulgarian Black Sea coast since the early 1990s. So far, {{the coast of the}} Strandzha Nature Park has remained almost intact. The most notable example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the Golden Pearl hotel complex near the village of Varvara, whose construction commenced in 2006 on the territory of the part, supported by Tsarevo Municipality without ecological evaluation. After protests the construction was declared illegal later that year but the mayor of Tsarevo and the investor appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria. In June 2007 the Court revoked the protected status of Strandzha Nature Park with order № 6794/29.06.2007. After mass protests the National Assembly adopted legislation prohibiting the right to appeal to court orders of the government establishing protected areas. In 2008 the Court declared the Golden Pearl hotel complex illegal and in 2012 the construction site was demolished.|$|E

25|$|There are {{towns in}} some {{countries}} where bicycle culture has been {{an integral part of}} the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Ílhavo, in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{notions of}} {{commutative}} algebra are counterparts of geometrical notions occurring in algebraic geometry. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Krull dimension, primary decomposition, regular rings, Cohen–Macaulay rings, Gorenstein rings {{and many other}} notions.|$|E
40|$|Often <b>the</b> {{scientific}} innovations <b>are</b> better {{explained by}} literature than scientific essay. In {{the stories of}} writers they acquire an identity otherwise so forced to remain contradictory. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Italo Calvino and Primo Levi about “thinking machines” arrived on stage of the History of the late 20 th century. In another perspective, this <b>was</b> also <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> another unusual observer of Cybernetics: Charles Darwin. ...|$|R
50|$|Also, a {{very few}} German {{families}} <b>were</b> elevated to <b>the</b> nobility without use of the preposition von. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riedesel Freiherren zu Eisenbach who received baronial dignity in 1680.|$|R

25|$|More {{interesting}} - or controversial - <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Neogaeornis. This bird, whose {{remains were}} found in Chile, might be a baptornithid also. Others consider it closely related to certain modern birds, either the Gaviiformes, or the Procellariiformes.|$|E
25|$|Variant {{chambered}} for 9×21mm IMI. This {{option was}} introduced in 1987 for markets where {{it is illegal to}} own a weapon chambered for a military cartridge such as 9×19mm; essentially, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Italy. There were also about 5000 early 98F manufactured in 7.65×21mm Parabellum.|$|E
25|$|Drying {{produces}} a decided {{increase in the}} strength of wood, particularly in small specimens.

50|$|However, {{receiving}} Motor Trends {{recognition is}} no guarantee <b>of</b> success. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nostalgic 2002 Ford Thunderbird, which did not meet expectations and <b>was</b> pulled from <b>the</b> market three years later.|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately we did {{not have}} {{analogous}} information on French and British firms. However, the examination of the sample (see below) revealed that the main source <b>of</b> sampling bias <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Spanish bankrupt firms.|$|R
25|$|After {{the police}} announcement, gasser reports declined. The only {{incident}} of arguable note after that date <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Bertha Burch, who claimed {{she saw a}} gasser who was a woman dressed as a man.|$|R
25|$|An idea is {{explored}} in Sabine Baring-Gould's work The Book of Werewolves is that werewolf legends {{may have been}} used to explain serial killings. Perhaps the most famous example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Peter Stumpp (executed in 1589), the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and cannibal, also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.|$|E
25|$|Other {{illustrations}} exist. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> some municipalities that {{decided that}} the public swimming pool should be separated {{between men and women}} 3 hours a week (1h30 each) to accommodate observant Muslims. It was also brought up with the decision of the Quebec Soccer Federation to lift the prohibition on Sikh head coverings.|$|E
25|$|Many of the TRIPS {{provisions}} on copyright were {{copied from}} the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works {{and many of}} its trademark and patent provisions were modeled on the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.

25|$|The principality of Moldavia {{covered the}} entire {{geographic}} region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically {{connected with the}} Moldavian principality. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the province of Pokuttya, the fiefdoms of Cetatea de Baltă and Ciceu (both in Transylvania) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} sockets {{have one or}} more earth holes to allow 3-pin plugs. On {{properly}} wired circuits, the earth contact will be connected to earth. However, they cannot provide earthing to all types of plugs, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Schuko (which requires recessed sockets containing side earthing contacts) and French plugs (which require an earthing pin projecting from the socket).|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the scope}} of “implied license” {{conjecture}} remains unclear and can compromise an enterprise’s ability to patent productions made with open source software. Another example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> companies offering add-ons for purchase; licensees who make additions to the open source code {{that are similar to}} those for purchase may have immunity from patent suits.|$|E
30|$|However, quite frequently, these titrations {{are not as}} {{accurate}} as expected and sometimes not applicable due to the low reactivity of the substance against reactants.

30|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dolphins network, {{we could}} not apply the Myerson value {{approach}} to the football network {{because of the difficulty}} in enumerating all simple paths. In contrast, the hedonic game approach can easily be applied.|$|R
25|$|The lack of {{definite}} evidence, except arguably in {{the form}} of photographs, makes birding records difficult to prove but birdwatchers strive to build trust in their identification.

25|$|The {{misinterpretation}} of some regulations {{has led to}} {{the confusion}} that certain universities do not prescribe headwear, most notably the Open University where the policy is that academic headgear is not worn at graduation ceremonies, whilst some universities have abandoned headwear for socio-political reasons or because the designer intended it, such as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Vivienne Westwood and her design for King's College London.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} legislation had little relevance on private law, {{though it did}} partially influence {{on the work of}} the Coder.

Vélez had also in mind the uses and customs of the country, especially regarding the family organisation.|$|E
25|$|Among the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most {{communities}} {{celebrate their}} homeland's patron saint, dedicating {{a day for}} this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs.
