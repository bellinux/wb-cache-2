5|$|On November9, 1965, the new Carp Bypass– {{a portion}} of Highway17 {{designed}} to replace the old meandering route (now known as Donald B. Munro <b>Drive)</b> <b>through</b> Carp, Marathon and Antrim – opened.|$|E
5|$|A McDonald's {{was located}} in the mall for fifteen years, but left in 2002 as part of {{regional}} owner Ron Blatchley's overall renovation plans. It was quickly replaced by the Brazos Valley seventh Sonic Drive-In location, the only in the area with neither a drive-in nor <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> option. The Sonic closed in late 2012.|$|E
5|$|An Ontario Parks visitor's permit is not {{required}} to <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> Algonquin Park. However, one is required for the use of any trails, campgrounds, the Visitor Centre, or similar facilities within the park boundary. Moose and deer are very common through Algonquin, especially at night and in the morning, and present a major driving hazard.|$|E

5|$|Driving {{through the}} east side of Zion to U.S. Route 89 allows access to Bryce Canyon National Park in the north or to the north rim of the Grand Canyon in the south. Due to the narrowness of the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel, RVs and buses must obtain a special pass and can only <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the tunnel during limited hours.|$|E
5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|England had {{the first}} {{overseas}} branch of KFC which opened in Preston, Lancashire in May 1965, {{and was the first}} American fast food restaurant chain in the country, pre-dating the arrival of McDonald's, Burger King and Pizza Hut by almost a decade. Ray Allen, an experienced Lancashire caterer, was the first franchisee. The first London branch opened in North Finchley in November 1968. In 1971 there were 31 outlets; by 1975 the chain had grown to 250 outlets. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, KFCs began to introduce seating. KFC opened its first <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> restaurant in the UK in 1984. By 1987 the company had almost 400 outlets.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{received}} {{permission from}} the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus. US10 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US24, including the segment concurrent with BL I-75. Wide Track <b>Drive</b> <b>through</b> downtown was renamed as the Woodward Avenue Loop in 2000.|$|E
5|$|OutRun Online Arcade {{features}} four {{modes of}} play: OutRun, Time Attack, Continuous Race, and Heart Attack. In OutRun mode, the player drives through five of fifteen stages, selecting them en route. The Continuous mode {{is similar to}} OutRun mode, but instead the player must <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> all fifteen stages. As in previous games in the series, {{there is a time}} limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints. Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre-selected set of stages while timed. Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{recreational}} {{activities in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists also come to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the Rogue River– Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.|$|E
50|$|The side knife {{may be used}} as a light froe, for {{splitting}} small billets of wood. It is <b>driven</b> <b>through</b> the billet using a hammer. Unlike a froe's extended handle, {{the side}} knife does not permit twisting to lever the split open and so it must be <b>driven</b> <b>through</b> all the way.|$|R

5|$|The {{area was}} poised to become a state park in 1903, but a veto by Governor Richard Yates {{prevented}} that from occurring. Supporters continued to press for the White Pines Woods, as it was once known, to receive state park designation throughout the period 1903-1927. In 1927 the park was established with help from supporters in the Chicago media. The park contains two freshwater streams, dolomite rock formations, {{and a variety of}} activities generally associated with Illinois state parks. Along Pine Creek, one of the park's two streams, fords were constructed instead of bridges allowing visitors to <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the creek.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} four months of 1945, III Corps moved quickly to the offensive. On 25 February, the corps, now as part of the First Army, {{established}} a bridgehead over the Roer River, which, in turn, led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, on the Rhine River, on 7 March. On 30 March, the Edersee Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division, and the corps, now commanded by Major General James Van Fleet after Millikin's relief, continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945. In late April, III Corps reformed and launched a <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> Bavaria towards Austria. On 2 May 1945, III Corps was ordered to halt at the Inn River on the Austrian border, just days before V-E Day, when the German forces surrendered, bringing an end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday evening, the two Ferraris were in front, with Vettel fastest at 1:45.682, while Räikkönen was {{almost half a}} second off his teammate's pace. The two Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo were behind, followed by both Mercedes cars, who trailed Vettel {{by more than a}} second. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso continued McLaren's good form and finished seventh fastest. Lewis Hamilton had several problems during the session; an early run was interrupted by him leaving the track and he was later called to <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the pit lane to cool down his overheating car. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest Williams driver in eleventh, just in front of Nico Hülkenberg, who drove a revised version of his Force India. The two Manor Marussia cars were again last, with Rossi almost three seconds ahead of Stevens.|$|E

5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{begins in}} Ludington at the {{intersection}} of James Street and Ludington Avenue. It is at this intersection where US10 turns southward and heads to the Ludington–Manitowoc ferry docks. From here, M-116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about one-half mile (0.8km) before turning north on Lakeshore Drive. The road continues as North Lakeshore <b>Drive</b> <b>through</b> resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery. Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club, M-116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park. The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route, through an area of sand dunes, until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park.|$|E
5|$|Mario Kart DS is {{a racing}} game, {{in which the}} player races in a kart against other racers as one of eight characters, each with three karts to choose from. While racing or battling, the Nintendo DS's top screen offers a third-person {{perspective}} of the player's kart, while the bottom touchscreen shows the race's current standings, items carried by each racer, and {{a map of the}} course. The bottom screen can be toggled to show either an overview of the entire course, or a bird's-eye view of the players kart and the immediate vicinity, including nearby racers, course hazards, item boxes, and incoming attacks. Each course features item boxes that the player can <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> to receive a randomly selected item, which the player can use to gain an advantage over other racers. Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow them down, while other items can be used to speed up the player's own kart to pass other racers more easily.|$|E

5|$|Smaller realignments {{also took}} place in other cities along the route. In Canandaigua, NY5 {{originally}} entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore <b>Drive</b> <b>through</b> the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell. In the mid-1950s, a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. It became part of a realigned NY5 by 1956. The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern extents {{of the city was}} built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former routing of NY5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY942T; until 1996, the portion of West Avenue between the west end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY942W. Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the quayside and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E
5|$|The {{traffic density}} on I-68 in Garrett County is rather sparse {{compared}} to that of Allegany County. At the Maryland–West Virginia state line, there is an annual average daily traffic of 11,581vehicles per day. This density increases to its highest point in Garrett County at exit22, where US219 leaves I-68; 19,551vehicles per day <b>drive</b> <b>through</b> this section. At the Allegany County line, the traffic density decreases slightly to 18,408. In Allegany County, the vehicle count increases to 28,861 in LaVale, and to the freeway's peak of 46,191 at the first US220 interchange (exit42) in Cumberland. East of Cumberland, the vehicle count decreases to 16,551 at Martins Mountain and stays nearly constant to the eastern terminus of I-68 in Hancock.|$|E
