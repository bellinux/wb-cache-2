5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E
5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 homes on the site. A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> site was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which {{the leader of the}} council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Banksia {{had previously been}} published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, {{a native}} Chagossian {{and leader of}} the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a {{judicial}} review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal.

5|$|Mayo Foundation v.

5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined {{to hear the case}} in October.|$|E

In his Pan American Games Closing Ceremony performance, {{close to the end}} of his performance, West closed the show by tossing his faulty microphone in the air and walked off stage.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{challenges}} to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.|$|E
5|$|The Monk {{wrote of}} the event in the Histoire de Charles VI (History of Charles VI), {{covering}} about 25 years of the King's reign.

5|$|The {{founder of}} khất sĩ {{had been a}} {{supporter}} of freeing birds {{as an act of}} compassion, and this has been continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious, but others have spoken out against on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture them in the first place.|$|E
5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crew was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, {{who had been the}} backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK. However following the publication, the British Government obtained a High Court order to confiscate all proceeds from the book, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government owned the copyright to anything written by Tomlinson. In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him {{for the loss of}} his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E

5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> case {{was not a good}} test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the most}} {{circulated}} coins in the United States {{at the time}} were Spanish currency, Hamilton proposed that minting a United States dollar weighing almost as much as the Spanish peso would be the simplest way to introduce a national currency. Hamilton differed from European monetary policymakers in his desire to overprice gold relative to silver, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States would always receive an influx of silver from the West Indies. Despite his own preference for a monometallic gold standard, he ultimately issued a bimetallic currency at a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold.|$|E
5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the High Commission in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This {{led to the formation}} of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently {{with the end}} of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia caleyi was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.caleyi as Sirmuellera caleyi. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
