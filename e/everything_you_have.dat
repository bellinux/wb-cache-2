500|$|Following its release, {{multiple}} critics {{found that}} the lyrics alluded to her turbulent high profile relationship with Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} <b>everything.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E
2500|$|McLaren's absence was {{formally}} registered at 4:00am (local time) and sparked a massive manhunt that drew in friendly forces {{from outside of}} the UK military sphere. McLaren's disappearance coincided with a visit to Afghanistan by the then British Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "throw <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got at trying to pick up this young man", rather than being taken of a tour around the district.|$|E

2500|$|According to ZDNet, critics {{believe that}} RFID {{will lead to}} {{tracking}} individuals' every movement and will be an invasion of privacy. In the book SpyChips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Move by Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, one is encouraged to [...] "imagine a world of no privacy. Where your every purchase is monitored and recorded in a database and your every belonging is numbered. Where someone many states away or perhaps in another country {{has a record of}} <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever bought. What's more, they can be tracked and monitored remotely".|$|E
2500|$|In 1924, a {{new project}} to enlarge the organ began. Marcel Dupré and Charles M. Courboin were among those asked by Rodman Wanamaker, John Wanamaker's son, to [...] "Work {{together}} {{to draw up a}} plan for the instrument. Use <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever dreamed about." [...] They were told there was no limit to the budget. This project resulted in, among other things, the celebrated String Division, which occupies the largest organ chamber ever constructed, 67 feet long, 26 feet deep, and 16 feet high. During this project, the organ's current console was constructed in Wanamaker's private in-house pipe-organ factory, with six manuals and several hundred controls. By 1930, when work on expanding the organ finally stopped, the organ had 28,482 pipes, and, if Rodman Wanamaker had not died in 1928, the organ would probably be even bigger.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional naval {{doctrine}} envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This {{view was}} challenged when army airman General Billy Mitchell demonstrated {{the capability of}} aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not {{been shown to be}} as lethal. The adage [...] "Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power" [...] was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel's hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to [...] "get to the other fellow with <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{as fast as you can}} and to dump it on him." [...] Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.|$|E
