5|$|In most cells, the <b>disassembly</b> of {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this <b>disassembly</b> of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo 1 Command Module {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's <b>disassembly</b> in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{polycarbonate}} Intel MacBook {{is easier}} for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial <b>disassembly</b> to access internal components such as the hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.|$|E
5|$|The two {{fighter jets}} were {{acquired}} from a scrapyard in Arizona, and {{were sent to}} Ross's studio in Oakland, California for <b>disassembly</b> and reconfiguration. Jet Kiss, as it was later renamed, was installed at Capitol Hill station in February 2015. The station {{opened to the public}} on March 19, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Seamans {{immediately}} {{ordered all}} Apollo 1 {{hardware and software}} impounded, to be released only under control of the board. After thorough stereo photographic documentation of the CM-012 interior, the board ordered its <b>disassembly</b> using procedures tested by disassembling the identical CM-014, and conducted a thorough investigation of every part. The board also reviewed the astronauts' autopsy results and interviewed witnesses. Seamans sent Webb weekly status reports of the investigation's progress, and the board issued its final report on April 5, 1967.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by <b>disassembly</b> of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical <b>disassembly</b> would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major <b>disassembly</b> of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the <b>disassembly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the <b>disassembly</b> of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E
5|$|Romania ordered 126 of {{the tanks}} on 14 August 1936 as the R-2 and {{received}} the first 15, which had been diverted from the Czech order, in April–May 1937 to display in a parade. They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved. The constantly changing Romanian demands didn't help the situation, but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania. Three R-2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials, but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests. After <b>disassembly</b> and checks of the trial tank were completed, the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August. In the meantime, the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July. Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed. 5 finished tanks and 6 almost-finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed. The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939.|$|E

25|$|During mitosis, lamins are {{phosphorylated}} by MPF, which {{drives the}} <b>disassembly</b> of the lamina {{and the nuclear}} envelope.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>disassembly</b> {{work of the}} bridges’ {{structural}} steel members, several difficult engineering challenges had to be resolved: the order of <b>disassembly,</b> a safe method for detonating charges on concrete and steel members in a publicly open and difficult to control area such as the Tampa Bay, {{and the development of}} a safe methodology for the removal in one piece of the bridge’s main span and concrete piers.|$|E
25|$|Equilibrium: The forces {{acting on}} the plasma must be {{balanced}} for containment. One exception is inertial confinement, where the relevant physics must occur faster than the <b>disassembly</b> time.|$|E
25|$|The main mode of {{therapeutic}} action of docetaxel is {{the suppression of}} microtubule dynamic assembly and <b>disassembly,</b> rather than microtubule bundling leading to apoptosis, or the blocking of bcl-2.|$|E
25|$|Some {{users have}} succeeded in {{flashing}} and running a stripped down but fully functional version of DD-WRT called 'micro' on a version 5 WRT54G. An easier method not requiring any <b>disassembly</b> of the device has since been devised for flashing v5-v8 to DD-WRT.|$|E
25|$|For 2007, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{listed the}} U.S. with about 5,400 total nuclear warheads: around 3,575 {{strategic}} and 500 nonstrategic warheads; and about 1,260 additional warheads {{held in the}} inactive stockpile. Other warheads are in some step of the <b>disassembly</b> process.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} fretting is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant; being composed of assorted mixtures of aluminium, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base – that allows repeated assembly and <b>disassembly</b> without wear and the elimination of fretting corrosion during use.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated <b>disassembly</b> and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated <b>disassembly</b> and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} fretting is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant between the mating parts. Composed of assorted mixtures of aluminum, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base, such lubrication allows repeated assembly and <b>disassembly</b> without wear and the elimination of fretting corrosion during use.|$|E
25|$|Art Bears were an English avant-rock group formed {{during the}} <b>disassembly</b> of Henry Cow in 1978 by {{three of its}} members, Chris Cutler (percussion, texts), Fred Frith (guitar, bass guitar, violin, keyboards) and Dagmar Krause (vocals; {{previously}} of Slapp Happy). The group released three studio albums between 1978 and 1981, and toured Europe in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Anti-microtubule {{agents are}} plant-derived {{chemicals}} that block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules {{are an important}} cellular structure composed of two proteins; α-tubulin and β-tubulin. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions. Microtubules are dynamic structures, {{which means that they}} are permanently in a state of assembly and <b>disassembly.</b> Vinca alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule <b>disassembly.</b> By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.|$|E
25|$|Projecting to {{the rear}} was a {{one-piece}} wire stock made from a formed steel rod that telescoped into tubes {{on both sides of}} the receiver. Both ends of the stock were tapped and drilled so that it could be used as a cleaning rod. It could also be used as a <b>disassembly</b> tool or as a wrench used to unscrew the barrel cap.|$|E
25|$|Assembly {{language}} {{is useful in}} reverse engineering. Many programs are distributed only in machine code form which is straightforward to translate into assembly language, but more difficult to translate into a higher-level language. Tools such as the Interactive Disassembler make extensive use of <b>disassembly</b> for such a purpose. This technique is used by hackers to crack commercial software, and competitors to produce software with similar results from competing companies.|$|E
25|$|Mini-E drivers {{participating}} in the field trial program of the vehicle were required to participate in online surveys and discussions, and to bring their vehicle into their local dealership to be worked on. The car was available only as a three-year limited lease, and drivers were required to return their cars to Mini who destroyed or donated them to tech schools and museums for display, <b>disassembly,</b> and analysis purposes.|$|E
25|$|When {{turning a}} cube over is {{considered}} to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without <b>disassembly</b> of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1×1024).|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} S-1 {{became the}} experimental {{platform for the}} operation of scout seaplanes late in 1923. The MS-1 and the Cox-Klemin XS {{were used for the}} trials, mounted in a cylindrical pod behind the conning tower. The first successful attempt was made on 5 November 1923. The first full cycle of surfacing, assembly, launching, retrieving, <b>disassembly,</b> and submergence took place on 28 July 1926, on the Thames River at New London, Connecticut using the XS-2.|$|E
25|$|The label {{consists}} of a molecule called ubiquitin. This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as the key in a lock, and signals that a protein {{is on the way}} for <b>disassembly.</b> Shortly before the protein is squeezed into the proteasome, its ubiquitin label is disconnected for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2002, no EV-1s {{remained}} on the road, as General Motors had repossessed all leased EV-1's from their lessees. One was {{on display at the}} Main Street in Motion exhibit at Epcot in Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Some other EV-1s repossessed from their lessees were donated to tech schools for <b>disassembly</b> and analysis purposes, never to be put back onto the road (General Motors had remotely deactivated all EV-1s so they could not be powered on ever again).|$|E
25|$|According to the Outer Space Treaty the United States and Russia {{are legally}} {{responsible}} for all modules they have launched. In ISS planning, NASA examined options including returning the station to Earth via shuttle missions (deemed too expensive, as the USOS is not designed for <b>disassembly</b> and this would require at least 27 shuttle missions), natural orbital decay with random reentry similar to Skylab, boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would delay reentry) and a controlled targeted de-orbit to a remote ocean area.|$|E
25|$|Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal {{metabolite}} used experimentally {{to disrupt}} the secretion pathway {{as a method of}} testing Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting <b>disassembly</b> of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.|$|E
25|$|Cellos are {{constructed}} and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for <b>disassembly</b> when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs {{call for the}} removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. in 2011, {{there are}} 13 {{reactors}} that had permanently {{shut down and}} are in some phase of decommissioning. With Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant and Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station having completed the process in 2006–2007, after ceasing commercial electricity production circa 1992. The majority of the 15 years, was used to allow the station to naturally cool-down on its own, which makes the manual <b>disassembly</b> process both safer and cheaper.Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the test}} runs, the first power cars {{were used for}} various other purposes. 401006 {{was sent to the}} Bundesbahn school at Munich-Aubing for three weeks in April 1990. Later the same month 401005 was used for {{fine-tuning}} the new depot at Hamburg-Eidelstedt to the trains. Starting 22 May, 401504 and 401008 were used to train drivers for acceptance runs at Nuremberg. At the same time, 401503 was sent to Nuremberg for a test <b>disassembly.</b> In early June 1990, 401010 was sent to the environmental test chamber at the Austrian Research and Test Center Arsenal.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{official}} firing tests {{recorded the}} De Lisle produced 85.5dB of noise when fired. As a comparison, modern testing on {{a selection of}} handguns has shown that they produce 156 to 168dB when firing without a suppressor, and 117 to 140dB when firing with one fitted. The de Lisle's quietness {{was found to be}} comparable to the British Welrod pistol. However, the Welrod was useful only at very short range and used fabric and rubber components in the suppressor that required replacement after a few shots. The de Lisle was able to fire hundreds of rounds before the suppressor required <b>disassembly</b> for cleaning.|$|E
