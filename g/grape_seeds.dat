5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency of four {{concentrations}} of <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> extract (0. 0, 0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 6 g/kg) in retarding oxidative rancidity was tested with cooked turkey breast meat.

Hexanal, pentanal, octanal, 2 -octenal, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 2 -octen- 1 -ol, and 1 -penten- 3 -ol showed high correlations (r 40 : 95) with TBARS values and could, therefore, serve as markers for the oxidation process in the cooked turkey breast meat. Supplementation of <b>grape</b> <b>seed</b> extract prior to cooking significantly improved oxidative stability of minced turkey meat during heat treatment and storage.

25|$|Anthocyanins {{have the}} ability to change into three {{different}} forms—colorless, red and blue—depending on the pH/acidity levels of the solution they are in. At wine pH (typically 2.9-4.0), most of the grape anythocyanins are in the colorless form unless they have reacted with tannins or other molecules (such as tannins also extracted from the skin as well as <b>grape</b> <b>seeds,</b> stems and from oak wine barrels) to form a stabilized pigment. So producers wishing to make rosé work to not only limit the amount of anthocyanins extracted into the wine but also limit the wines exposure to tannins (either by less maceration time, gentle pressing of the grapes or use only stainless tanks instead of oak) as well as protective anti-oxidative winemaking techniques that limit the development of acetaldehyde and other browning pigments that could add color to the wine.|$|E
25|$|When yeast cells die, they sink to {{the bottom}} of the {{fermentation}} vessel where they combine with insoluble tartrates, <b>grape</b> <b>seeds,</b> skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|E
2500|$|Flavan-3-ols (catechins) are {{flavonoids}} {{that contribute}} to the construction of various tannins and contribute to the perception of bitterness in wine. They are found in highest concentrations in <b>grape</b> <b>seeds</b> but are also in the skin and stems. Catechins {{play a role in the}} microbial defense of the grape berry, being produced in higher concentrations by the grape vines when it is being attacked by grape diseases such as downy mildew. Because of that grape vines in cool, damp climates produce catechins at high levels than vines in dry, hot climates. Together with anthocyanins and tannins they increase the stability of a wines color-meaning that a wine will be able to maintain its coloring for a longer period of time. The amount of catechins present varies among grape varieties with varietals like Pinot noir having high concentrations while Merlot and especially Syrah have very low levels.|$|E

Eight weeks after diabetes induction by streptozotocin (60 mg kg - 1) the body weight and blood glucose were measured and mesenteric vascular bed responses to vasoactive agents (acetylcholine, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside) were determined.
