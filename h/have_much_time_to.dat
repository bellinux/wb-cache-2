She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The ground zero of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented she would rather go again as she did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> stay in New York.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden homes on the beach for sturdier brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated a moratorium on all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the second}} quarter began, the Cowboys {{successfully}} used their passing game {{to move to the}} endzone; tight end Jason Witten scored the touchdown on a 7-yard catch. The touchdown followed by the extra point extended Dallas' lead to 21–3. On the next drive, the Cowboys defense limited the Seahawks offense to a punt. Starting a fresh drive at the Cowboy 20, quarterback Tony Romo threw a 38-yard strike to Roy E. Williams. Three consecutive incompletions by Romo led the Cowboys to send in kicker Nick Folk to hit a 41-yard field goal through the uprights. After an unsuccessful offensive drive by the Seahawks, the Dallas offense returned to the field, though were forced to their first three-and-out. Once Seattle got the ball back, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck found two of his receivers who both combined for a gain of 47 yards. The Seahawks, however, lost nine of those yards on two quarterback sacks. They had to settle again for another field goal to cut Dallas' lead to 24–6. Both of the team's offenses each had one three-and-out during the 1:31 left in the half. The Cowboys got the ball back, though did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> engineer a successful drive. Romo kneeled to end the half. Overall, Dallas' four scoring drives in the first half consisted of 26 plays, 17 of which occurred on a first down; just three came on third down.|$|E

25|$|Moving {{towards the}} west-northwest and already near the United States Gulf Coast, the NHC's {{official}} forecast {{at the time}} of Bill's formation indicated that the storm would not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> strengthen over water. However, meteorologists Jeff Masters and Bob Henson of Weather Underground noted the possibility of Bill strengthening over land via the brown ocean effect due to floods in the previous month that helped saturate soils in Texas and Oklahoma. The cyclone's organization remained steady as the storm approached the coast, with most of the convection taking place around the storm's eastern half, with rainbands primarily occupying the eastern and southern portions of Bill's circulation. At 15:00UTC on June16, Bill reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mbar (hPa; 29.44inHg) as the storm was located 15mi (20km) south of Port O'Connor, Texas. At peak intensity, Bill made landfall on Matagorda Island at 16:45UTC and began moving into inland Texas. At 09:00UTC on June17, Bill was downgraded to tropical depression intensity, though it maintained an organized structure. The next day, Bill had rapidly deteriorated as it moved northeastward. However, the system's strength slowly weakened. Operationally, it was announced that Bill stayed tropical throughout most of its lifetime, being declared a remnant low on June 20 by the WPC, however the NHC's post storm analysis revealed that Bill had degraded into a remnant low on June 18, while the storm was situated over Tulsa, Oklahoma. Bill's remnant low continued to move eastward for several more days, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on June 23.|$|E

Jackie Brygel from TV Week described Mark as being [...] "handsome" [...] and a [...] "charming investigator." [...] Mark is a perfectionist, who puts his work ahead of everything else and he struggles to hold down a relationship because of it.

Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. After casting him, they told Thompson's agent that Thompson needed a hair cut, because at the start the Alien Bounty Hunter {{was supposed to be a}} kind of military pilot who'd been shot down.

According to Kinberg, Rogue was to be rescued by the future Magneto and Xavier to provide the elder characters a mission, [...] "something like Unforgiven". Eventually the producers felt it was a subplot that did [...] "not service the main story", and reshot scenes to replace them. However, she was still featured in the film's various promotional materials. Paquin later stated that she still had fun making the film and did not mind that the majority of her scenes had been cut from it.|$|E

Spotnitz and Carter did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> cast the character, but they knew this casting would be important since they intended the character to become a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth. Megan Leitch also appeared in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game" [...] as a grown-up clone version of Samantha Mulder, and would return to play Samantha or one of her clones over the other seasons. Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha, since that would have been [...] "straight science fiction" [...] and it was too [...] "ridiculous" [...] to give too many answers. Darren McGavin, star of , was sought out for the part of Senator Matheson in [...] "Little Green Men" [...] and Mulder's father in [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "End Game", but the roles went to Raymond J.
