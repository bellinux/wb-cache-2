40|$|Service {{offshoring}} of IT-enabled {{services has}} been labeled {{as the new}} wave of globalization. However, research has shown that every second offshored project never reaches the expected cost savings, simply because companies fail to include <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> that are additional to the contract costs. Furthermore, several studies have acknowledged that distance- culture- and language differences affect the financial success of offshored processes as well as the magnitude of <b>extra</b> <b>costs.</b> Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to scrutinize and label <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> that Volvo Cars encounter, as well as to further investigate how offshore-specific factors affect <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> when they offshore outsource business processes. Moreover, the study is conducted in an explanatory nature with exploratory elements, and by means of a qualitative approach. In order to analyze the empirical findings, theories related to <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> and to offshore-specific challenges have been investigated and reviewed. Hence, it could be concluded from the study that Volvo Cars has encountered nine different <b>extra</b> <b>costs,</b> as well as that all the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were influenced by different offshore-specific factors in various ways.

40|$|Gaining {{economic}} benefits from substantially lower labor costs {{has been reported}} as {{a major reason for}} offshoring labor-intensive information systems (IS) services to low-wage countries; however, if wage differences are so high, why is there such a high level of variation in the economic success between offshored IS projects? This study argues that offshore outsourcing involves a number of <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> for the client organization that account for the economic failure of offshore projects. The objective is to disaggregate these <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> into its constituent parts and to explain why they differ between offshored software projects. The focus is set on software development and maintenance projects that are offshored to Indian vendors. A theoretical framework is developed a priori based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the knowledge-based view of the firm, complemented by factors that acknowledge the specific offshore context. The framework is empirically explored using a multiple case study design including six offshored software projects in a large German Financial Service institution. The results of our analysis indicate that the client incurs post contractual <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> for four types of activities: (1) requirements specification and design, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) control, and (4) coordination. In projects that require a high level of client-specific knowledge about idiosyncratic business processes and software systems, these <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were found to be substantially higher than in projects were more general knowledge was needed. Notably, these costs most often arose independently from the threat of opportunistic behavior, challenging the predominant TCE logic of market failure. Rather, the client <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> were particularly high in client-specific projects because the effort for managing the consequences of the knowledge asymmetries between client and vendor were particularly high in these projects. Prior experiences of the vendor with related client projects were found to reduce the level of <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> but could not fully offset the increase in <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> in highly client-specific projects. Moreover, cultural and geographic distance between client and vendor as well as personnel turnover were found to increase client <b>extra</b> <b>costs.</b> Slight evidence was found, however, that the cost increasing impact of these factors was also leveraged in projects {{with a high level of}} required client-specific knowledge (moderator effect) ...|$|R

5|$|Initial plans {{had called}} for the bridge to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this <b>extra</b> <b>cost.</b> The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan from}} 1995 {{involved}} two intermediate stations, at Vevelstad and Kolbotn. The plans also suggested building {{the line in}} two phases, first between Ski and Kolbotn, and then from Kolbotn to Oslo. In 2008, the National Rail Administration announced two possible plans for the right-of-way—both predominantly in tunnel. The one proposal included Kolbotn, the other did not. Both excluded Vevelstad as a station on the new line, since the station could not develop as a hub, and would still keep services along the existing commuter line. A report from Det Norske Veritas published in 2008, and ordered by the Rail Administration, concluded that neither a station at Vevelstad or at Kolbotn could support the <b>extra</b> <b>cost</b> of construction. A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion, while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13.5 billion. The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north. The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub. In 2009, the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn, stating {{that it was more}} important to secure a fast connection to Ski. At the same time, they promised to upgrade the existing station at Kolbotn.|$|E

40|$|Equivalisation of incomes for {{household}} size and composition is accepted practice when measuring poverty and inequality; adjustments {{to take account}} of other variations in needs are rarely made. This paper explores the financial implications of one possible source of additional needs: disability. Using two UK household surveys, we seek to establish whether there are <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of living associated with disability, and to quantify them using the ¿standard of living¿ approach. The underlying theory is that a household¿s standard of living is a function of income and needs. The <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of disability can be derived by comparing the standard of living of households with and without disabled members at a given income, having controlled for other sources of variation. Results show that the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of disability are substantial, especially for disabled people living alone, and that these costs rise with severity of disability. To bring out the policy implications of these results, we compare and contrast three different income distributions which differ in their adjustment for the <b>extra</b> <b>costs</b> of disability, for the population as a whole and for various subgroups. We find that unadjusted incomes significantly understate the problem of low income amongst disabled people, and thereby in the population as a whole...|$|R
