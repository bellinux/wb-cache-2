50|$|In a {{place like}} this, words fail; in the end, there can only be a dread silence - a silence which is itself a heartfelt cry to God: Why, Lord, did you remain silent? How could you {{tolerate}} all this? In silence, then, we bow our heads before the <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of those who suffered and were put to death here; yet our silence becomes in turn a plea for forgiveness and reconciliation, a plea to the living God never to let this happen again.|$|R

50|$|Mark Ridley {{first opened}} the Comedy Castle on January 4, 1979, in the {{basement}} of a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan restaurant. Ridley created the three comic set (emcee, feature performer, and headliner) to better organize shows and stage time each night after witnessing an <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of performers at Los Angeles clubs like The Improv and The Comedy Store, making Mark Ridley’s Comedy Castle one of the first clubs in the nation to do so.

It is the oldest operating comedy club in Michigan.|$|R
60|$|A {{brighter}} {{day than}} that which succeeded the night last mentioned never dawned upon the massive domes, the gorgeous palaces, and the glittering canals of Venice. The sun had not been long above {{the level of the}} Lido before the strains of horns and trumpets arose from the square of St. Mark. They were answered in full echoes from the distant arsenal. A thousand gondolas glided from the canals, stealing in every direction across the port, the Giudecca, and the various outer channels of the place; while the well known routes from Fusina and the neighboring isles were dotted with <b>endless</b> <b>lines</b> of boats urging their way towards the capital.|$|R
50|$|The {{scarcity}} of cash due to demonetisation led to chaos, {{and most people}} holding old banknotes faced difficulties exchanging them due to <b>endless</b> <b>lines</b> outside banks and ATMs across India, which became a daily routine {{for millions of people}} waiting to deposit or exchange the 500 and 1000 banknotes since 9 November. ATMs were running out of cash after a few hours of being functional, and around half the ATMs in the country were non-functional. Sporadic violence was reported in New Delhi, but there were no reports of any grievous injury, people attacked bank premises and ATMs, and a ration shop was looted in Madhya Pradesh after the shop owner refused to accept 500 banknotes.|$|R
60|$|They {{expected}} to have reached the camp of Darius at daybreak, but the distance was greater than they had supposed. At length, however, the Macedonians, in their march, came upon the brow {{of a range of}} hills, from which they looked down upon numberless and <b>endless</b> <b>lines</b> of infantry and cavalry, and ranges after ranges of tents, which filled the plain. Here the army paused while Alexander examined the field, studying for a long time, and with great attention, the numbers and disposition of the enemy. They were four miles distant still, but the murmuring sounds of their voices and movements came to the ears of the Macedonians through the calm autumnal air.|$|R
50|$|Various {{mechanisms}} are proposed for capturing the kinetic energy of winds such as kites, kytoons, aerostats, gliders, gliders with turbines for regenerative soaring, sailplanes with turbines, or other airfoils, including multiple-point building- or terrain-enabled holdings. Once the mechanical energy {{is derived from}} the wind's kinetic energy, then many options are available for using that mechanical energy: direct traction, conversion to electricity aloft or at ground station, conversion to laser or microwave for power beaming to other aircraft or ground receivers. Energy generated by a high-altitude system may be used aloft or sent to the ground surface by conducting cables, mechanical force through a tether, rotation of <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> loop, movement of changed chemicals, flow of high-pressure gases, flow of low-pressure gases, or laser or microwave power beams.|$|R
60|$|Once out of {{the town}} we saw no one until {{we came to the}} circle of guards which I have already mentioned, who stood there like an <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of black statues. In answer to their {{challenge}} Goza gave some complicated password in which my name occurred, whereon they opened out and let us through. Then we marched on to the mouth of the kloof. The place was very dark, for now the sun was down in the west and the moon in the east was cut off from us by the hills and would not be visible here for half an hour or more. Presently I saw a spot of light. It was a small fire burning near the tongue of rock which I have described.|$|R

She escapes after being sent down a slide leading from the women's quarters to a hall in the palace. In Beate Petersen's animated docudrama Nasseredin Shah and his 84 wives (2011) the king is depicted in animated silhouette receiving an <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of (fully clothed) wives down a slide, while real decisions about the kingdom are made by others.

5000|$|Jimmy Webb's {{inspiration}} for the lyric came while driving through Washita County in rural southwestern Oklahoma. At that time, many telephone companies were county-owned utilities, and their linemen were county employees. Heading westward on a straight road (arguably Country Road 152) into the setting sun, Webb drove past a seemingly <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of telephone poles, each looking {{exactly the same as}} the last. Then, in the distance, he noticed the silhouette of a solitary lineman atop a pole. He described it as [...] "the picture of loneliness". Webb then [...] "put himself atop that pole and put that phone in his hand" [...] as he considered what the lineman was saying into the receiver. Glen Campbell added in a statement to the Dallas Observer that Webb wrote the song about his first love affair with a woman who married someone else.|$|R
60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of which we speak things were quiet at the offices. The line of pigeon-holes in the wire curtain was deserted by the public, though the linoleum-covered floor bore abundant traces of a busy morning. Misty London light shone hazily through the glazed windows and cast dark shadows in the corners. On a high perch in the background a weary-faced, elderly man, with muttering lips and tapping fingers, cast up <b>endless</b> <b>lines</b> of figures. Beneath him, in front of two long shining mahogany desks, half a score of young men, with bent heads and stooping shoulders, appeared to be riding furiously, neck and neck, in the race of life. Any habitue of a London office might have deduced from their relentless energy and incorruptible diligence that they were under {{the eyes of some}} member of the firm.|$|R

In the riot with police that follows, Ruth is killed trying to find him, and he is arrested as a ringleader of the mob. Tom is put away for five years in prison; in the meantime, the invention he helped finance continues to sell nationwide, throwing countless other people out of work. When Tom gets out, it is 1932, {{the heart of the}} Depression. Unimaginably rich, he refuses to take the proceeds, which by now amount to over fifty thousand dollars. Instead, it goes to feed the <b>endless</b> <b>line</b> of hungry and jobless that come seeking a handout at the diner that Pop Dennis and Mary run.

Indeed, Good, who is always fond of a bad joke, christened it [...] "Unlimited Loo." [...] Soon we came to a moat with a drawbridge, where we were met by the rattling of arms and the hoarse challenge of a sentry. Infadoos gave some password that I could not catch, which was met with a salute, and we passed on through the central street of the great grass city.

As the two armies fought an artillery duel, reconnaissance indicated to Keyes the strength and breadth of the Confederate fortifications, and he advised McClellan against assaulting them. McClellan ordered the construction of siege fortifications and brought his heavy siege guns to the front. In the meantime, Gen. Johnston brought reinforcements for Magruder.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{important}} aspects affecting economical use of cableways in forestry are examined. First {{part of the}} thesis deals with comparison between existing performance standards for cableways and values obtained from field research during yarding the timber.

Second part of the thesis is focused on economic aspects of the cableway operation. The whole issue is illustrated on model example analysing year costs and yields resulting from cableway operation. Output of this work is also a file of MS Excel programme which calculates year costs and yields {{on the basis of}} entered parameters (cableway price, labour costs, number of the months of cableway operation [...] .). From these values the return on investment to cableway is then calculated...|$|R

5000|$|Labour unions had {{funds for}} {{temporary}} income support for newly unemployed workers, {{to which the}} government added some subsidy. So union members were spared real poverty for a limited period. In the later stages of the depression however these union funds became depleted while the government also reduced its subsidy, forcing unions to steadily decrease the time period and amount of support. Non-unionised workers and workers whose union support period had run out depended on a government poverty fund, which supported them up to subsistence level. This minimal income support came with a heavy social stigma, which reflected the values of contemporary society. Support receivers had to report at a government agency twice a day, waiting in the <b>endless</b> <b>lines</b> of unemployed which {{became a symbol of}} the depression. They also had to allow government inspectors to visit them at home and investigate their daily life, which quickly became a strongly hated practice among the unemployed.|$|R
