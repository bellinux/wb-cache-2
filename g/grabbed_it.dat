5|$|Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Petry had {{an active}} youth, {{and joined the}} Army after high school. Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program, he was {{deployed}} several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan {{as a member of}} the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. On May 26, 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> and attempted to throw it away from them. He saved the soldiers' lives but the grenade exploded, severing his right hand.|$|E
5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, {{struggling}} against the local spinners, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey {{played a key role}} in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged a pull shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out.|$|E

Despite not getting a game in the 2011 IPL, when he finally got a chance in the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 in an injury ravaged Mumbai Indians side, he quickly <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> with a rapacious 45 off 21 balls versus South African franchise Cape Cobras with 3 fours and 5 sixes. He was then looking for another six but was caught by Owais Shah off a Robin Peterson delivery near the boundary. The Mumbai Indians amassed 176 thanks to another 58 by Kieron Pollard. The match eventually finished a no result due to rain.|$|E

25|$|Morton: Oh, I'll sing {{you some}} scat songs. That was way before Louis Armstrong's time. By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> in New Orleans. And found it was pretty good for an introduction of a song.|$|E

25|$|Triple H {{defeated}} Stone Cold Steve Austin in an Anything Goes {{match for}} the WWF Championship. When Triple H attempted to use his sledgehammer against Austin, Vince McMahon <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> from him. They spent seven minutes of the match outside the ring, where Austin used a steel fence, trashcan, and microphone as weapons. Once in the ring, both men attempted to end the match by utilizing their finishing maneuvers. Back outside of the ring, Austin threw Triple H into both the steel ring stairs and the announce table, causing him to bleed profusely. Near {{the end of the}} match, The Rock, bandaged from his injuries earlier in the night, came down to ringside carrying the sledgehammer. Although he was aiming at Triple H, he accidentally hit Austin with the weapon. Taking advantage of the situation, Triple H Pedigreed The Rock and pinned Austin to retain his WWF Championship. After the match, Austin and Triple H continued to fight into the backstage area, where Chyna picked Triple H in a limousine and drove away.|$|E

25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, <b>grabbed</b> <b>it,</b> and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{returned}} to his business as a private eye, working {{in the same building}} as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients was Jonathan Richards, who hired Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard managed to recover the necklace. But on his way to give it back to Richards, he found himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain's collection. Upon returning to Earth, he confronted the Ringmaster, who had been hypnotizing old people into robbing for him, after he was robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man's aunt. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard was approached by Richards {{in the middle of his}} fight against the Ringmaster and Richards revealed himself to be Talos the Untamed, who revealed that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara located the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but were unable to put it all together when Talos <b>grabbed</b> <b>it,</b> who proceeded to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos was confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara took cover. He was able to point out that Tara, who revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos was later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything went back to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented Hydra from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck was shown to be living in She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moves out.|$|E

He simply <b>grabbed</b> <b>it</b> and ripped it apart, as the spirit of God divinely empowered him. However, Samson kept it a secret, not even mentioning the miracle to his parents. He arrived at the Philistine's house and became betrothed to her. He returned home, then came back to Timnah some time later for the wedding. On his way, Samson saw that bees had nested in the carcass of the lion and made honey. He ate a handful of the honey and gave some to his parents.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{the role}} of Gerry Adams was {{questioned}} by former prisoner Richard O'Rawe, who was the public relations officer inside the prison during the strike. O'Rawe states in his book Blanketmen that Adams prolonged the strike as it was of great political benefit to Sinn Féin and allowed Owen Carron to win Sands' seat. This claim is denied by several hunger strikers and Brendan McFarlane, who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike. McFarlane claims O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states [...] "We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken.

A nearby store employee said he heard [...] "15 to 20 gunshots". Loughner stopped to reload, but dropped the loaded magazine from his pocket to the sidewalk, from where bystander Patricia Maisch <b>grabbed</b> <b>it.</b> Another bystander clubbed the back of the assailant's head with a folding chair, injuring his elbow in the process, representing the fourteenth injury. Loughner was tackled to the ground by Bill Badger, a 74-year-old retired United States Army Colonel [...] who had also been shot himself. Loughner was further subdued by Maisch and bystanders Roger Sulzgeber and Joseph Zamudio. Zamudio, a concealed weapon (CCW) permit holder, had a weapon on his person, but arrived after the shooting had stopped and did not draw his firearm. Thirty-one shell casings were found at the scene by investigators.|$|E
