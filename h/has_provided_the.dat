5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E

The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the light water reactor (LWR) technology that <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> United States' primary nuclear reactors.

5|$|Indonesian {{independence}} was secured through {{a blend of}} both diplomacy and force. Despite their ill-discipline raising the prospect of anarchy, without youth confronting foreign and Indonesian colonial forces, Republican diplomatic efforts would have been futile. The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave impetus to communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay {{team won the}} 5,000m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney. However, they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the {{discipline}} was introduced and failed to win a medal, {{and all of the}} individual competitors finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field. They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short track relay yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half in six of their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.|$|E
5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) <b>has</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, {{but also}} {{been criticized for}} its {{football}} sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities {{to find a new}} home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|E
