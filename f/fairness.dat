5|$|The work of George Akerlof and Janet Yellen on {{efficiency}} wages {{based on}} notions of <b>fairness</b> {{provides an example}} of a feminist model of economic actors. In their work, agents are not hyperrational or isolated, but instead act in concert and with <b>fairness,</b> are capable of experiencing jealousy, and are interested in personal relationships. This work is based on empirical sociology and psychology, and suggests that wages can be influenced by <b>fairness</b> considerations rather than purely market forces.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Frank {{founded the}} {{non-profit}} Center for Class Action <b>Fairness</b> (CCAF) to represent consumers {{dissatisfied with their}} counsel in class actions and class action settlements. According to The American Lawyer, as of March 2013, the CCAF had successfully challenged two dozen settlements.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to these concerns, DFS services implemented changes to improve the <b>fairness</b> and transparency of their contests, including entry limits, banning off-site scripts, identifying veteran-level players, allowing users to block players they {{do not wish to}} compete against, and adding beginner-level contests intended for new users.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of <b>fairness</b> in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of <b>fairness</b> may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
5|$|The press {{themselves}} came in {{for some}} criticism in this respect, with the group <b>Fairness</b> and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be executed. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the {{confession}} was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. Amid objections against the <b>fairness</b> of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{took control}} of the Chicago Public School system in 1995 and {{appointed}} Paul Vallas. When Vallas left the post to run for governor, Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan, who later became the U.S. Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees. Daley said it was an issue of <b>fairness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{call for}} a shift in how {{economic}} success is measured. These changes include an increased focus on a policy's ability to bring society toward social justice and improve people's lives, through specific goals including distributive <b>fairness,</b> equity, the universal provisioning of needs, elimination of poverty, freedom from discrimination {{and the protection of}} human capabilities.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2004, Kefalas {{worked as}} a public policy {{advocate}} and community development coordinator for Catholic Charities until his departure amidst a controversy regarding his public support for Roe v. Wade and abortion rights during his 2004 legislative campaign. Before entering the legislature, he directed the Colorado Progressive Coalition's Tax <b>Fairness</b> Project. He {{has served as a}} member of the Fort Collins Housing Authority and the Colorado Social Legislation Committee, and, in 2001, won the City of Fort Collins Human Relations Award.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual <b>fairness</b> of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, <b>fairness</b> and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as he insisted {{that there was nothing}} anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} {{legislation that}} would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action <b>Fairness</b> Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as <b>fairness,</b> law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or <b>fairness,</b> and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Board met {{to draft}} a reply cable, which was sent on 30 January, {{indicating}} that they wished the series to continue and offering to postpone consideration of the <b>fairness</b> of bodyline bowling until after the series. The MCC's reply, on 2 February, suggested that continuing the series would be impossible unless the accusation of unsporting behaviour was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of <b>fairness.</b> English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of <b>fairness</b> {{in the conduct of}} {{disciplinary}} proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is at stake, where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E
5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of separation of powers, and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and <b>fairness</b> be observed.|$|E
25|$|Rabin <b>fairness</b> is a <b>fairness</b> model {{invented by}} Matthew Rabin. It {{goes beyond the}} {{standard}} assumptions in modeling behavior, rationality and self-interest, to incorporate <b>fairness.</b> Rabin's <b>fairness</b> model incorporates findings from the fields of economics and psychology fields to provide an alternative utility model. <b>Fairness</b> is one type of social preference.|$|E
25|$|According to Christina Starmans et al. (Nature Hum. Beh., 2017), the {{research}} literature contains no evidence on people having an aversion on inequality. In all studies analyzed, the subjects preferred fair distributions to equal distributions, in both laboratory and real-world situations. In public, researchers may loosely speak of equality instead of <b>fairness,</b> when referring to studies where <b>fairness</b> happens to coincide with equality, but in many studies <b>fairness</b> is carefully separated from equality {{and the results are}} univocal. Already very young children seem to prefer <b>fairness</b> over equality.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{procedural}} <b>fairness</b> to {{an entire}} society therefore seems certain to create recognizable inefficiencies , and therefore be unfair, and (by the equivalence of justice with <b>fairness)</b> unjust.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Corker {{endorsed}} the Marketplace <b>Fairness</b> Act and voted for its {{passage in the}} Senate. The Marketplace <b>Fairness</b> Act would enable states to begin collecting sales taxes on online purchases.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to widespread criticism, the government introduced a <b>Fairness</b> Test {{to replace the}} standard. However, the legislation was not retrospective and so {{did not apply to}} agreements created between the inception of the original Work Choices legislation on 27 March 2006 and when the <b>Fairness</b> Test became operative on 7 May 2007.|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, the {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature {{in the application of}} the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and <b>fairness,</b> legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of <b>fairness</b> that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of legitimate expectations. In their elaboration of {{the doctrine}}, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, <b>fairness,</b> and abuse of power to justify the existence and the protection of legitimate expectations.|$|E
25|$|Logic {{might have}} demanded the outcome {{reached by the}} High Court in Harriton, but <b>fairness</b> demands another.|$|E
25|$|For first-order tableaux without unification, the {{condition}} of <b>fairness</b> is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal quantifier might require more than one application. <b>Fairness</b> amounts to expanding every universal quantifier infinitely often. In other words, a fair policy of application of rules cannot keep applying other rules without expanding every universal quantifier in every branch that is still open once in a while.|$|E

25|$|Justice or <b>fairness</b> {{refers to}} the idea that an action or {{decision}} is morally right, which may be defined according to ethics, religion, <b>fairness,</b> equity, or law. People are naturally attentive to the justice of events and situations in their everyday lives, across a variety of contexts (Tabibnia, Satpute, & Lieberman, 2008). Individuals react to actions and decisions made by organizations every day. An individual's perceptions of these decisions as fair or unfair can influence the individual's subsequent attitudes and behaviors. <b>Fairness</b> is often of central interest to organizations because the implications of perceptions of injustice can impact job attitudes and behaviors at work. Justice in organizations can include issues related to perceptions of fair pay, equal opportunities for promotion, and personnel selection procedures.|$|E
