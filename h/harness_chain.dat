50|$|On January 12, 1921, Wilson {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Short Ship Circuit, a <b>harness</b> racing <b>chain.</b> From 1929 to 1935 he was president of the Bay State Light Harness Circuit.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wrenn lay {{listening}} to the unfriendly rattling of the <b>chain</b> <b>harness</b> below for a long time. When he crawled languidly down from the hay-loft he glowered in a manner which was decidedly surly even for Bill Wrenn at a middle-aged English stranger who was stooping over a cow's hoof in a stall facing the ladder.|$|R
50|$|The Scavengers {{begin at}} the top of a tall tower with the cells {{illuminating}} the base. The female Scavengers must abseil down to the bottom of a chain about halfway down the tower and attach her safety <b>harness</b> to the <b>chain.</b> The male Scavengers can then winch the female scavengers down to the base then they flip upside down to grab the cells and place them in net bags.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supported}} on timber piers sheathed in concrete. A span near the southern bank is moveable and is situated between two timber lift towers. The lift span {{can be raised}} by hand using a <b>chain</b> <b>harness</b> and a system of cables and pulleys located on the timber lift towers and balanced by concrete counter weights. It carries metal tramway lines of 2-foot (610mm) gauge laid over timber sleepers. Two metal ladders with metal handrails provide access {{to the top of}} the lift towers where there is a tubular metal guardrail.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of the Epiphany (1510), a pageant was {{introduced}} into the hall at Richmond, representing a hill studded with gold and precious stones, and having on its summit a tree of gold, from which hung roses and pomegranates. From the declivity of the hill descended a lady richly attired, who, with the gentlemen, or, as they were then called, children of honour, danced a morris before the king. On another occasion, {{in the presence of the}} court, an artificial forest was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of which were richly embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were <b>harnessed</b> with <b>chains</b> of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. In the midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded tower, at the end of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a garland of roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which succeeded the pageant!" ...|$|R
60|$|Devine drove a birch log {{behind the}} wheels {{and then ran}} to the leaders' heads and cracked his whip, while Harding called to the pole-team. For a few moments the {{battering}} hoofs churned up the sloppy trail and the wagon groaned and shook, the horses floundering and slipping without moving it. Then with a harsh creak the high wheels began to turn and they slowly struggled up the hill. <b>Harness</b> rattled, <b>chain</b> and clevis rang, the steam from the toiling animals rose in a thin cloud, and white smears streaked their coats as they strained at the collar. The men were red in face and panting hard, but as they fought the grade they broke into breathless shouts. Harding was sparing of the whip; {{but this was not}} a time to be weakly merciful, when the load might overpower his teams and, running back, drag them over the edge. Nor dare he stop again and subject the animals to the cruel effort of restarting. They must get up somehow before their strength gave out.|$|R
25|$|A {{particularly}} significant find {{from this period}} was made in 1943 at Llyn Cerrig Bach on Anglesey, when the ground was being prepared {{for the construction of}} a Royal Air Force base. The cache included weapons, shields, chariots along with their fittings and <b>harnesses,</b> and slave <b>chains</b> and tools. Many had been deliberately broken and seem to have been votive offerings. These finds are considered to be one of the most important collections of La Tène metalwork discovered in Britain. Pottery on the other hand is fairly rare in Wales during this period and most of what has been found appears to be imported.|$|R
5000|$|Cerberus: Cerberus was {{intended}} to appear as a bonus stage in the stage called [...] "Beast Fight", which is made even more clearer and notable if a player looks at {{the map of the}} game and sees the oddly placed [...] "Intermission" [...] sign between the 3rd and 4th opponents. Though named after the mythical beast, the dogs only have two heads and two tails instead of three, and wear a <b>chain</b> <b>harness</b> on their backs. They attack en masse, with the player scoring points depending on how many they managed to defeat when time was up. This bonus stage ended up retooled and used in the game's sequel.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} iron implement {{found in}} Wales is a sword from Llyn Fawr {{at the head}} of the Rhondda Valley, which is thought to date to about 600 BC.

60|$|Most of {{all they}} fought {{to save the}} wooden driving shed behind the church from which the fire could leap {{into the heart of}} Mariposa. That was where the real fight was, {{for the life of the}} town. I wish you could have seen how they turned the hose against the shingles, ripping and tearing them from their places with the force of the driven water: how they mounted on the roof, axe in hand, and cut madly at the rafters to bring the {{building}} down, while the black clouds of smoke rolled in volumes about the men as they worked. You could see the fire horses <b>harnessed</b> with logging <b>chains</b> to the uprights of the shed to tear the building from its place.|$|R

50|$|Week 9 - 5-Way Tug of War - The contestants {{entered a}} {{circular}} arena, which had 5 pairs of paddles spaced around the edge, and {{were told that}} the challenge was a traditional 5 way tug of war. Each team was <b>harnessed</b> to a <b>chain</b> and the aim was to be the first team to collect both of their respective paddles. The prize for winning this challenge was a half kilo weight advantage going into the weigh-in; for coming last, it was a half kilo weight penalty. The first team to get a paddle was the Green team, followed by the Orange team. The Orange team eventually collected their second paddle, thus winning the challenge and the half kilo weight advantage. However, Mandy had her leg caught in the chain and was injured, so the Green team decided to help out the Grey team by pulling in their direction. As a result, the Grey team came second, leaving it between the Green, Light Blue and Pink teams. Since the Pink team was naturally at a disadvantage as the lightest team they formed an alliance with the Light Blue team so that the Pink girls would come third, leaving the Light Blue's to battle with the Green team in a two-way tug of war. However, once the Light Blue's got their first paddle with the Pink's help they went back on their word and took their second paddle without returning the favour. This left the Green team against the Pink team which the former won with ease, giving the Pink team a half kilo weight penalty.|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} may {{combine the}} optical and electronic properties of semiconductors with the desirable mechanical and processing capabilities that characterise polymeric “plastic” materials. The first demonstration of electroluminescence from conjugated-polymer-based devices 25 years ago created {{the field of}} Plastic Electronics which has since witnessed spectacular scientific and technological progress, yielding novel devices for applications in light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, electronics, photonics, sensing, and many others. The molecular nature of conjugated polymers results in weak, typically van der Waals-type, interchain bonding which enables straightforward and cost-effective processing of these materials from the melt or solutions. However, the trade-off for this desirable characteristic is that the solid-state microstructure of conjugated polymers can be extremely sensitive to processing conditions, leading {{to a wide variety}} of structural polymorphs that limit reproducibility of the optoelectronic properties of devices and, hence, prevent their commercialisation. For this reason small organic molecules are often used in preference to conjugated polymers, since the former’s microstructure can be more precisely controlled via chemical synthesis and deposition protocols. Nevertheless, there are examples of conjugated polymers that also exhibit well-defined structures. This has been demonstrated, among others, for poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) (PFO) – a widely-studied blue-emitting conjugated polymer – which can adopt a precisely-defined planar-zigzag chain conformation termed the “β-phase”. Introducing a fraction of β-phase chain segments leads to dramatic – and often advantageous – changes to the optoelectronic properties of PFO. In order to <b>harness</b> the β-phase <b>chain</b> conformation of PFO with the aim of optimising its solid-state optoelectronic properties, three distinct directions need to be investigated, which motivated the research presented in this thesis. First, the mechanism responsible for the formation of the β-phase of PFO is still little-understood; specifically, the role of inter-chain interactions in the formation of intra-chain (conformational) order remains ambiguous. To this end, the formation of the β-phase in PFO solutions with common organic solvents was systematically investigated. Unexpectedly, it is found that solution-crystallisation of PFO proceeds via polymer-solvent compound formation, enabled by adoption of the β-phase conformation which features along-chain cavities that allow for simultaneous inclusion/intercalation of solvent molecules of matching volume. Remarkably, it is shown that the physically-bound intercalated solvent stabilises the β-phase conformation in the absence of specific inter-chain interactions. This makes the β-phase conformation distinct from other conformational isomers and crystalline forms of PFO. An additional consequence of β-phase formation by complexation with the solvent is that the β-phase chain conformation is inherently well-defined and crystallisation-condition-invariant in terms of its intermonomer torsion angle. Second, while selected aspects of the influence of the β-phase on the optoelectronic properties of PFO have been reported, many of them deserve further study. For instance, the effect of the relative fraction of β-phase chain segments on absorption and photoluminescence spectra, as well as photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE), is examined. It is demonstrated that, in comparison to the in-plane isotropic, “glassy” films, PLQE is enhanced by up to 15...|$|R
