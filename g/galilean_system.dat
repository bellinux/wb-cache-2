In order to relate this result to the relativistic thermodynamics of moving bodies, we employ the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to prove that a state cannot satisfy the KMS conditions with respect to two different inertial frames whose relative velocity is non-zero. This implies that the concept of temperature stemming from the zeroth law is restricted to states of bodies in their rest frames and thus that there is no law of temperature transformations under Lorentz boosts.

40|$|We {{modify the}} {{approach}} of Burton and Toland [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (2011) ] to show the existence of periodic surface water waves with vorticity in order that it becomes suited to a stability analysis.

In particular, for smooth profiles and smooth stream functions, the normal component of the velocity field at the free boundary is not required a priori to vanish in some <b>Galilean</b> coordinate <b>system.</b> Travelling periodic waves are obtained by a direct minimisation of a functional that corresponds to the total energy and that is therefore preserved by the time-dependent evolutionary problem (this minimisation appears in Burton and Toland after a first maximisation). In addition, we not only use the circulation along the upper boundary as a constraint, but also the total horizontal impulse (the velocity becoming a Lagrange multiplier). This allows us to preclude parallel flows by choosing appropriately the values of these two constraints and {{the sign of the}} vorticity.

50|$|Following Thomas Young’s ideas, {{light was}} {{regarded}} in the 19th century {{to move as}} vibrations (undulations) in a substance called the Luminiferous aether, contrary to Newton’s ideas that light itself was made of substantive corpuscles. Exploring {{the nature of this}} aether, Albert Michelson published in 1881 his laboratory experiments where he had light travel {{in the direction of the}} earth’s motion and perpendicular to it. Thus measured on the moving earth, he found no difference in the speed of light traveling with the earth or perpendicular to it. It would have fully conformed to rules prevailing in a <b>Galilean</b> invariance <b>system</b> of coordinates, also called Newtonian inertial system, which apply to moving material particles. In the 1887 paper, written with Edward Morley, Michelson amended the route of the perpendicular light from ab1 to ab: “It may be mentioned here that the error was pointed out to the author of the former paper by M.A. Potier, of Paris, in the winter of 1881.” When the instrument on the moving earth is observed from a stationary point outside earth, the mirror at b1 already moved to b while light was traveling there from a. “This meant that Michelson had overestimated by a factor of two the fringe shifts originally expected.” The mirror at c also moved forward at the same time, but this was not taken into account. It thus seemed that light traveled different distances at the same time, which led George FitzGerald and Hendrik Lorentz (Lorentz ether theory) to postulate that distances shortened and time dilated in direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction).|$|R
40|$|We present {{new ways}} to {{identify}} single and multiple moons around extrasolar planets using planetary transit timing variations (TTVs) and transit duration variations (TDVs). For planets with one moon, measurements from successive transits exhibit a hitherto undescribed pattern in the TTV-TDV diagram, originating from the stroboscopic sampling of the planet's orbit around the planet-moon barycenter. This pattern is fully determined and analytically predictable after three consecutive transits. The more measurements become available, the more the TTV-TDV diagram approaches an ellipse. For planets with multiple moons in orbital mean motion resonance (MMR), like the <b>Galilean</b> moon <b>system,</b> the pattern is much more complex and addressed numerically in this report. Exomoons in MMR can also form closed, predictable TTV-TDV figures, {{as long as the}} drift of the moons' pericenters is suciently slow. We find that MMR exomoons produce loops in the TTV-TDV diagram and that the number of these loops is equal to the order of the MMR, or the largest integer in the MMR ratio. We use a Bayesian model and Monte Carlo simulations to test the discoverability of exomoons using TTV-TDV diagrams with current and near-future technology. In a blind test, two of us (BP, DA) successfully retrieved a large moon from simulated TTV-TDV by co-authors MH and RH, which resembled data from a known Kepler planet candidate. Single exomoons with a 10 percent moon-to-planet mass ratio, like to Pluto-Charon binary, can be detectable in the archival data of the Kepler primary mission. Multi-exomoon systems, however, require either larger telescopes or brighter target stars.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} influence which a geophysical process (giant impacts) has on a geochemical marker (composition) during terrestrial planet formation. Simultaneously studying all planets maximizes the available constraints and permits examination of {{controls on the}} overall composition of the Earth. I also examine the <b>Galilean</b> satellite <b>system</b> to determine the universality of the terrestrial conclusions. The late stages of planetary accretion involve stochastic, large collisions. Impact-related erosion and fragmentation can have profound consequences for the rate and style of accretion and the bulk chemistries of terrestrial planets. However, the previous predominate assumption in computer models of accretion was that all collisions resulted in perfect merging despite the likelihood of these collisions producing a range of outcomes (e. g., hit-and-run, removal of material from target, or production of several post-collision bodies). In this work, I investigate the effects of late-stage accretion with multiple collision types and the consequences on the bulk (mantle/core) and isotopic (Hf [...] W) composition. My model is composed of two parts: (1) N-body accretion code tracks orbital and collisional evolution of the bodies and (2) geochemical post-processing evolves composition in light of impact-related mixing, partial equilibration and radioactive decay. For terrestrial planets, Part (1) is Chambers (2013, Icarus) and incorporates multiple collisional outcomes. For Galilean satellites, Part (1) is Ogihara & Ida (2012, Icarus) and assumes perfect merging for all collisions thus the model is not self-consistent (it likely overestimates compositional changes). For the terrestrial planets, the {{results are consistent with}} observed mantle/core ratios and tungsten isotopic anomalies. A moderate (approx. 0. 4) core equilibration factor is preferred due to protracted accretion time. It is important to include multi-modal collisions when modeling planet formation if composition, timescales, or spatial distribution of mass are being investigated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to apply the analogy between gravity and {{condensed}} matter physics to relativistic Bose-Einstein condensates (RBECs), i. e. condensates composed by relativistic constituents. While such systems are not yet a subject of experimental realization, they do {{provide us with a}} very rich analogue model of gravity, characterized by several novel features with respect to their non-relativistic counterpart. Relativistic condensates exhibit two (rather than one) quasi-particle excitations, a massless and a massive one, the latter disappearing in the non-relativistic limit. We show that the metric associated with the massless mode is a generalization of the usual acoustic geometry allowing also for non-conformally flat spatial sections. This is relevant, as it implies that these systems can allow the simulation of a wider variety of geometries.

40|$|Background: The most {{desirable}} effect following cataract {{surgery in the}} presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is to obtain an improvement in distance resolution acuity, and the only optical solution to this is the use of telescopic magnification. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop and verify the clinical utility of inducing low-grade telescopic magnification (< 33 %) at the time of cataract surgery by the choice of an appropriate intraocular lens power and spectacle glasses in patients with AMD and cataract. Methods: The design was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series involving 6 patients aged 74 - 86 (mean 80; SD 4) years with AMD and cataract. Participants were males and females, equal in number, who had visual acuity of less than 20 / 400 in the weaker eye. Standard cataract surgery was performed in the weaker eye. The power of the intraocular lens was derived from the reduced Gullstrand model of the eye in such a way that at the intraocular lens plane a minus lens was created, which, together with a plus lens in matching glasses, formed a <b>Galilean</b> telescopic <b>system</b> with magnification of up to 33 %. Outcome measures were visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and activities of daily living (ADL) scores. Results: The mean power of the implanted intraocular lenses was 6. 31 (SD 2. 42) diopters and, according to the theoretical derivations, achieved magnification between 20 % and 30 % (mean 26 %; SD 4. 92 %). Visual acuity improved for the group from a mean of 20 / 525 (logMAR 1. 48; SD 0. 13) to a mean of 20 / 290 (logMAR 1. 20; SD 0. 21). Contrast sensitivity improved significantly (p < 0. 001) only in the lower spatial frequencies. Postoperatively, ADL scores improved significantly in all patients except one. At the end of the follow-up period, 3 patients reported that they would like to proceed with similar surgery for the other eye. Interpretation: An optimal surgical telescopic device based on low-grade telescopic magnification may improve functional vision for usage in all tasks in AMD patients. All patients from this study were satisfied following surgery and viewed study outcomes as positive and beneficial, and some patients responded with enthusiasm. Surgeons are encouraged to use this modified technique of cataract surgery in low-vision patients with AMD and cataract. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that a nonrelativistic {{mechanical}} system involving a general nonrelativistic potential V(|r 1 -r 2 |) between point particles at positions r 1 and r 2 can be extended to a Lagrangian system which is invariant under Lorentz transformation through order v^ 2 /c^ 2. However, this invariance requires the introduction of velocity-dependent and acceleration-dependent forces between particles. The textbook treatments of "relativistic mechanics" can be misleading; the discussions usually deal with only one particle experiencing prescribed forces and so make no mention of these additional velocity- and acceleration-dependent forces. A simple example for a situation analogous to a parallel-plate capacitor is analyzed for all the conservation laws of Galilean invariance or Lorentz invariance. For this <b>system,</b> <b>Galilean</b> invariance requires that the mechanical momentum is given by pmech=mv but places no restriction on the position-dependent potential function. On the other hand, Lorentz invariance requires that the mechanical momentum is given by pmech=mv/(1 -v^ 2 /c^ 2) ^ 1 / 2, and in addition requires that the potential function is exactly the Coulomb potential V(|r 1 -r 2 |) =k/|r 1 -r 2 |. It is {{also noted that the}} transmission of the interparticle-force signal {{at the speed of light}} again suggests a special role for the Coulomb potential.

If the planet Mercury condenses at 1640 K, so accounting for the high density of that planet via a process of chemical fractionation between iron and silicates, then T (sub n) at Jupiter's orbit is 158 K. Only 35 % of the water vapour condenses out. Thus fractionation between rock and ice, together with an enhancement in the abundance of solids relative to gas which takes place through gravitational sedimentation of solids onto the mean orbit of the gas ring, ensures nearly equal proportions of rock and ice in each of Ganymede and Callisto. Io and Europa condense above the H 20 ice point and consist solely of hydrated rock (h-rock). The Ganymedan condensate consists of h-rock and H 20 ice. For Callisto, NH 3 ice makes up - 5 % of the condensate mass next to h-rock (approximately 50 %) and H 2 O ice (approximately 45 %). Detailed thermal and structural models for each of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are constructed on the basis of the above initial bulk chemical compositions. For Europa (E), a predicted 2 -zone model consisting of a dehydrated rock core of mass 0. 912 M (sub E) and a 150 km thick frozen mantle of salty H 2 O yields a moment-of-inertia coefficient which matches the Galileo Orbiter gravity measurement. For Ganymede (G), a 3 -zone model possessing an inner core of solid FeS and mass approximately 0. 116 M (sub G), and an outer H 2 O ice mantle of mass approximately 0. 502 M (sub G) is needed to explain the gravity data. Ganymede's native magnetic field was formed by thermoremanent magnetization of Fe 3 O 4. A new Callisto (C) model is proposed consisting of a core of mass 0. 826 M (sub C) containing a uniform mixture of h-rock (60 % by mass) and H 2 O and NH 3 ices, and capped by a mantle of pure ice. This model may have the capacity to yield a thin layer of liquid NH 3 (raised dot) 2 H 2 O at the core boundary, in line with Galileo's discovery of an induced magnetic field...|$|R
