5|$|The 2/3rd Battalion's final {{involvement}} in the campaign came as the 16th Brigade advanced towards Sanananda in November. They left the Wairopi area on 16 November, with the battalion second in order of march. Tired and <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> the exertions {{of the last two}} months, the advance across the swamps of the coastal plain proved heavy work. On the first day they made , but after heavy rains the following day and failures in the resupply effort, a large number of men fell behind due to exhaustion. On 19 November, the 2/3rd spearheaded the brigade's advance to the coast. Several Japanese stragglers were taken prisoner and a number of minor contacts followed, but the Japanese defenders withdrew before the Australians could shake out to conduct an assault.|$|E
5|$|When Professor Crater arrives, he is {{reluctant}} to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like mottling {{on his face and}} a plant root visible in his mouth; Nancy says that she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but the mottling is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam, and together with Spock determines that Darnell died after all the salt was <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> his body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). They spread out to search, but Crater slips away. Kirk and McCoy find Sturgeon's body. Meanwhile, unseen by them, Nancy has killed Green; the faces of Green and Sturgeon show the same mottling as Darnell. Nancy alters her shape, assuming the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the Russian River was one {{of several}} rivers {{draining}} westward from the Mayacamas Mountains through the Mendocino Plateau to the sea, a region lifted up by tectonic forces. The Navarro River <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> the Cobb Mountain area, while the Russian River <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> the Mt. St. Helena area. Being at a lower elevation, the Russian River began cutting north into the drainage area of the Navarro River. Eroding up a fault line in Alexander Valley, the Russian River intersected the Navarro River just north of Cloverdale. In one fell swoop, the Russian River took Big Sulphur Creek (formerly the upper Navarro River) and the north fork of the Navarro River, going north to Hopland and to Ukiah. The high valleys were eroded into rocky canyons for ten miles north of Cloverdale and for five miles east of Cloverdale.|$|E

Faced with an increased burden of disease and coupled by a massive exodus of the health workforce, the health systems of many African nations are risking complete paralysis. Several studies have suggested policy options to reduce brain <b>drain</b> <b>from</b> Africa. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review possible policies, which can stem the impact of health professional brain <b>drain</b> <b>from</b> Africa. A systemic literature review was conducted. Cinahl, Science Direct and PubMed databases were searched with the following terms: health professional brain <b>drain</b> <b>from</b> Africa and policies for reducing impact of brain <b>drain</b> <b>from</b> Africa. References were also browsed for relevant articles. A total of 425 articles were available for the study but only 23 articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified nine policy options, which were being implemented in Africa, but the most common was task shifting which had success in several African countries. This review has demonstrated that there is considerable consensus on task shifting as the most appropriate and sustainable policy option for reducing the impact of health professional brain <b>drain</b> <b>from</b> Africa...|$|R

25|$|John Frye also {{describes}} how {{the format of the}} projects changed rapidly. Initially intended as two separate solo releases, they decided to merge their work and create a soundtrack album as André 3000 had initially intended. The duo then began preparing to work on a motion picture, but reconsidered and compromised by interpolating background noise into songs, such as the slamming of car doors and footsteps. They eventually settled on releasing a double album. Frye noted the end of the recording sessions as particularly stressful for André 3000, who he described as <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> working at four studios simultaneously. In total, an estimated 120 songs were recorded for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below.|$|E

Queen Aga'po also claims that violet light is filling an emptiness in their hearts and replacing their capacity for creating fear. The delegate meeting ends poorly for the Oans, as the Zamarons refuse to stop their pursuit of the violet light. Perhaps in response, the Guardians unanimously vote that love between Green Lanterns is forbidden within the Corps.|$|E

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not the real issue. They say the real issue is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|E

Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis at exactly the same stage before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 unforced errors, but began to find her game in the second set. She raced to a 5–2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6–4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2–0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been <b>drained</b> <b>from</b> her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two unforced errors less than the Belgian.
