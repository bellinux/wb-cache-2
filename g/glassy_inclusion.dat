These differences suggest that the chondrule precursors of Y- 691 were produced by intense fractional condensation in comparison with those of ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites. For Y- 691,the Ca/Al ratios of chondrules showing high Na/Al are {{lower than those of}} chondrules showing low Na/Al. This indicates that a fraction of Ca component was expelled from the chondrule precursors by reactions with a nebular gas, which also introduced alkalis into the chondrule precursors. In addition to magnesian chondrules, Y- 691 includes unusual inclusions and ferroan chondrules. One unusual <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusion,</b> as well as others, are similar in chemical composition to fine-grained CAI 2 ̆ 7 s and amoeboid olivine inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites, respectively. The precursors of the unusual inclusions and ferroan barred-Ol-Px chondrules seem to have formed under oxidized conditions, whereas the precursors of magnesian chondrules were produced from a reduced nebular gas. The oxidizing conditions may have been produced by evaporation of chondritic or cometary materials in the solar nebula...|$|E

Garnet occurs in low modal amount (2 – 5 vol. %). Very rare muscovite is present as armoured inclusions, indicating prograde exhaustion. Microstructural evidence of melting in the migmatites includes pseudomorphs after melt films and nanogranite and <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> hosted in garnet cores. The latter microstructure demonstrates that garnet crystallized {{in the presence of}} melt. Re-melted nanogranites and preserved <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> show leucogranitic compositions. Phase equilibria modelling of the stromatic migmatite in the MnO–Na 2 O–CaO–K 2 O–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 – H 2 –O 2 –C (MnNCaKFMASHOC) system with graphite-saturated fluid shows P–T conditions of equilibration of 4. 5 – 5 kbar, 660 – 700 °C. These results are consistent with the complete experimental re-melting of nanogranites at 700 °C and indicate that nanogranites represent the anatectic melt generated immediately after entering supersolidus conditions. The P–T estimate for garnet and melt development does not, however, overlap with the low-temperature tip of the pure melt field in the phase diagram calculated for the composition of preserved <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> in garnet in the Na 2 O– CaO–K 2 O–FeO–MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 –H 2 O (NCKFMASH) system. A comparison of measured melt compositions formed immediately beyond the solidus with results of phase equilibria modelling points to the systematic underestimation of FeO, MgO and CaO in the calculated melt. These discrepancies are present also when calculated melts are compared with low-T natural and experimental melts from the literature. Under such conditions, the available melt model does not perform well. Given the presence of melt inclusions in garnet cores and the P–T estimates for their formation, we argue that small amounts (< 5 vol. %) of peritectic garnet may grow at low temperatures (≤ 700 °C), as a result of continuous melting reactions consuming biotite...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of crystallized and <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> (MI) in high-grade, partially melted metapelites and metagraywackes {{has opened up}} new possibilities to investigate anatectic processes. The present study focuses on three case studies: khondalites from the Kerala Khondalite Belt (India), the Ronda migmatites (Spain), and the Barun Gneiss (Nepal Himalaya). The results of a detailed microstructural investigation are reported, along with some new microchemical data on the bulk composition of MI. These inclusions were trapped within peritectic garnet and ilmenite during crystal growth and are therefore primary inclusions. They are generally isometric and very small in size, mostly £ 15 lm, and only rarely reaching 30 lm; they occur in clusters. In most cases inclusions are crystallized (nanogranites) and contain a granitic phase assemblage with quartz, feldspar {{and one or two}} mica depending on the particular case study, commonly with accessory phases (mainly zircon, apatite, rutile). In many cases the polycrystalline aggregates that make up the nanogranites show igneous microstructures, e. g. granophyric intergrowths, micrographic quartz in K-feldspar and cuneiform rods of quartz in plagioclase. Further evidence for the former presence of melt within the investigated inclusions consists of melt pseudomorphs, similar to those recognized at larger scale in the host migmatites. Moreover, partially crystallized inclusions are locally abundant and together with very small (£ 8 lm) <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> may occur in the same clusters. Both crystallized and partially crystallized inclusions often display a diffuse nanoporosity, which may contain fluids, depending on the case study. After entrapment, inclusions underwent limited microstructural modifications, such as shape maturation, local necking down processes, and decrepitation (mainly in the Barun Gneiss), which did not influence their bulk composition. Re-homogenized nanogranites and <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> show a leucogranitic and peraluminous composition, consistent with the results of partial melting experiments on metapelites and metagraywackes. Anatectic MI should therefore be considered as a new and important opportunity to understand the partial melting processes...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} and model a potential re-equili- bration {{process that can}} affect compositions of melt inclusions in magnesian olivine phenocrysts. This pro- cess, referred to as "Fe-loss", can operate during natural pre-eruptive cooling of host magma and results in lower FeOt and higher MgO contents within the initially trapped volume of inclusion. The extent of Fe-loss is enhanced by large temperature intervals of magma cooling before eruption. The compositions of homoge- nised melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from several subduction-related suites demonstrate that (1) Fe-loss is a common process, (2) the maximum observed degree of re-equilibration varies between suites, and (3) within a single sample, variable degrees of re-equilibration can be recorded by melt inclusions trapped in olivine pheno- crysts of identical composition. Our modelling also demonstrates that the re-equilibration process is fast going to completion, in the largest inclusions in the most magnesian phenocrysts it is completed within 2 years. The results we obtained indicate {{that the possibility of}} Fe-loss must be considered when estimating composi- tions of parental subduction-related magmas from nat- urally quenched <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> in magnesian olivine phenocrysts. Compositions calculated from <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> affected by Fe-loss will inherit not only erroneously low FeOt contents, but also low MgO due to the inherited higher Mg# of the residual melt in re- equilibrated inclusions. We also demonstrate that due to the higher MgO contents of homogenised melt inclu- sions affected by Fe-loss, homogenisation temperatures achieved in heating experiments will be higher than original trapping temperatures. The extent of overheat- ing will increase depending on the degree of re-equili- bration, and can reach up to 50 degrees C in cases where complete re-equilibration occurs over a cooling interval of 200 degrees C...|$|R
40|$|Magmatic {{inclusions}} in martian meteorites occur mainly within olivine and pyroxene grains.

They are grouped into five types {{on the basis of}} their silicate mineral assemblages, from <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> of type I to kaersutite-bearing inclusions of type V. The types of magmatic inclusions in shergottites reflect cooling rates of their host lithologies. The compositions of glasses in magmatic inclusions have a wide range, even if they occur within a single grain of olivine or pyroxene. The wide compositional range of the glasses in magmatic inclusions is caused by metastable crystallization of the residual melts; some magmatic inclusions crystallize only wall olivine, although some crystallize pyroxene, a silica mineral, plagioclase, or kaersutite in addition to wall olivine. The wide compositional range of glasses and the variety in texture and mineral assemblages of magmatic inclusions seem to be controlled by cooling rates of the host lithology, nucleation processes of the minerals, chemical compositions of the residual melts, and so on. The chemical trends of residual melts in magmatic inclusions are explained by using a pseudoternary phase diagram of quartz-olivine-plagioclase...|$|R

They {{have recently}} been discovered in several locations. This discovery opens new possibilities for investigating crustal melting processes, provided that an appropriate method for retrieving the information contained within nanogranite inclusions is available. Here, we describe a series of remelting experiments that have been performed at different temperatures and under dry, and H 2 O-added, conditions on nanogranite inclusions hosted in migmatitic garnet, using a piston-cylinder apparatus. The glasses obtained by quenching the sample from temperature that approaches the trapping temperature have compositions {{very similar to those}} of preserved <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> coexisting with nanogranites in the same cluster. No significant differences in H 2 O contents were observed for nanogranites rehomogenized under dry and wet conditions. Higher (50 – 100 °C) experimental temperatures resulted in dissolution of the host into the melt and inclusion decrepitation with the loss of volatiles. Therefore, piston-cylinder remelting experiments may eliminate inclusion decrepitation, maintaining the primary fluid contents in the originally trapped melt. These volatiles would otherwise be lost during remelting experiments at ambient pressure. By preventing volatile loss, the inclusion {{does not have to be}} overheated to achieve homogenization, and the compositions of quenched glasses so obtained can be assumed to be those of melts produced (and trapped as inclusions) during crustal anatexis. The experimental approach described here represents a promising technique for the successful rehomogenization of crystallized melt inclusions from high-pressure environments, such as the mafic continental crust...|$|R

H 2 O/Ce ratios vary from 119 to 245 in the most pristine Mangaia inclusions; excluding an inclusion that shows evidence for assimilation, the primary magmatic H 2 O/Ce ratios vary up to ∼ 200, and are consistent with significant dehydration of oceanic crust during subduction and long-term storage in the mantle.

The work of this thesis focuses on the investigation of metapelitic Kinzigites from the Ivrea-Verbano Zone (Italy) and migmatitic paragneisses from Kaligandaki Valley (Central Nepal) and on the characterization of melt inclusions found in peritectic garnet from these rocks. In both cases inclusions are very small (< 15 m), polycrystalline aggregates of quartz + feldspar + micas (“nanogranites”); no finding of <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> was observed. Quantitative analysis of the polycrystalline inclusions was difficult to obtain due to analytical limits and sample preparation difficulty; in fact inclusions were often mechanically removed during polishing. The final {{aim of this study}} was the re-homogenization of the inclusions to obtain the bulk composition of the trapped melt: this was undertaken using both a high temperature and room pressure stage and a high pressure piston-cylinder. Usually anatectic melt composition is inferred from migmatitic leucosomes, that are affected by fractional crystallization and differentiation phenomena that can change the original composition, or assumed using experimental analogues that cannot totally reproduce natural processes; therefore the study of glassy or re-homogenized nanogranitic inclusions found in peritectic minerals can {{be the only way to}} obtain the bulk composition of the melt during anatexis. Heating stage experiments were not successful, since the inclusions showed evidences of decrepitation and oxidation (probably due to volatile loss) but did not melt at all. The inclusions were successfully re-melted at 900 ° C and 8 Kbar using a piston cylinder apparatus, proving they are nanogranites trapped within garnet during incongruent melting reactions. The melt obtained shows in both cases a granitic composition clearly affected by interactions with the host garnet (decrepitation, growth of peritectic orthopiroxene) due to over-heating, thus the data obtained cannot be used for quantitative interpretation. New experiments should be performed in the future at lower temperature and higher pressure to find the chemical composition of the melt and its trapping temperature. ...|$|R

40|$|Trace-element {{chemistry}} and microscopic observations of included gem corundum (α-AlO) suggests {{a new model}} of syngenetic growth of oriented rutile inclusions rather than the usual interpretation of their growth through exsolution. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is now a robust method for measuring trace elements in gem-quality corundum (ruby and sapphire). Nonetheless, the corundum structure is relatively unforgiving for substitutional components and typically only a small handful of minor to trace elements are measured by LA-ICP-MS (Mg, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ga). Less commonly, trace elements such as Be, Zr, Nb, Sn, La, Ce, Ta, and W are found in natural corundum. Their concentrations are typically correlated with high contents of Ti and silky or cloudy zones in the corundum that contain a high concentration of needle-like rutile or other oxide inclusions. Three metamorphic-type sapphires from Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and Tanzania were studied here using LA-ICP-MS, electronprobe microanalysis (EPMA), and nanoSIMS to document correlations between the various trace elements and their distribution between the corundum and included, oriented rutile TiO needles. NanoSIMS and EPMA measurements show concentration of Be, Mg, Fe, V, Zr, Nb, Ce, Ta, and W in the rutile needles. The relative atomic concentrations of Mg and Ti from LA-ICP-MS measurements suggest the corundum-rutile intergrowth grew as a mechanical mixture of the two phases as opposed to rutile formation through exsolution from the corundum host. This scenario is also suggested for the three magmatic-type sapphires studied here based on the presence of <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> in close association with included, oriented oxide needles. The preservation of a <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusion</b> requires fast cooling, whereas exsolution of the oxide inclusions would require slow cooling and annealing at a temperature lower than sapphire formation.

The interpretation of such oriented oxide inclusions has important implications for understanding the geological formation conditions based on trace element data or using such data to separate sapphires and rubies based on their geographic origin...|$|R

40|$|Geochemical {{measurements}} of OIB (ocean island basalt) samples {{have demonstrated that}} the Earth's mantle is compositionally heterogeneous, but {{the cause of this}} heterogeneity is a point of debate within the scientific community. One such OIB location is Mangaia, Cook Islands (Polynesia). Its lead isotopic composition defines the HIMU (high μ = high ^ 238 U/^ 204 Pb) mantle endmember, which many attribute to recycled oceanic crust being present in the mantle source. If true, this endmember represents an important vehicle for returning surface material to the mantle and an opportunity to study volatile element cycling through the mantle. Sulfur isotopic measurements were made on sulfides hosted in melt inclusions from Mangaia. Prior to 2. 45 Ga, the Earth's atmosphere was not oxygenated, allowing photochemical cycles to fractionate sulfur isotopes. This form of fractionation results in a mass independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur isotopic signature in surface materials containing sulfur. We have found such a signal in sulfide inclusions from Mangaia, indicating that the material erupted at this young (~ 19 Ma) ocean island was once at the surface over 2. 45 Ga. This finding confirms the recycled origin hypothesis for the generation of the HIMU mantle endmember. Lead isotopes and major elements were measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions from the island. Previous studies by Saal et al. (1998) and Yurimoto et al. (2004) have revealed large lead isotopic variability, spanning half of the global range for OIBs. A more recent study by Paul et al. (2011) has shown much reduced lead isotopic variability using a different analysis technique. We find the lead isotopic variability in <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> to be less than previously found and attribute much of the earlier observed variability to contaminant lead.

Notwithstanding appreciable uncertainties, cooling rates correlate with depositional process (fall vs. flow deposition) and distance above the cold ground or below overlying, hot pyroclastic-flow deposits. Plinian inclusions within 2. 5  m of the cold, pre-Bishop ground cooled at 1 – 10  °C s – 1, consistent with thermal modeling of small pumice clasts falling through cold air. Very slow, inferred cooling rates for pyroclastic-flow deposits (~ 10 – 6 to 10 – 8   °C s – 1) also agree with thermal-conduction models. Faster cooling rates (~ 10 – 1 to 10 – 4   °C s – 1) for inclusions in the lowermost 0. 5  m of pyroclastic-flow deposits reflect the effect of quenching against the cold ground. At Blind Spring Hill (east of Long Valley Caldera), intermediate cooling rates (10 – 3 to 10 – 6   °C s – 1) are observed in Plinian deposits overlain by, and partially interbedded with, pyroclastic-flow deposits, indicating that reheating of rapidly cooled Plinian inclusions can reset water speciation. Melt inclusions in pyroclastic-flow deposits are quenched to glass only if the deposit is relatively thin or has a relatively low emplacement temperature.

Based on color and composition, the 465 microtektites so far identified include two groups of transparent glass spheres less than ca. 800 µm in diameter: the most abundant pale-yellow, or normal, microtektites, and the rare pale-green, or high-Mg, microtektites. The major element composition of normal microtektites determined through electron microprobe analysis is characterized by high contents of silica (SiO 2 = 71. 5 ± 3. 6 (1 sigma) wt%) and alumina (Al 2 O 3 = 15. 5 ± 2. 2 (1 sigma) wt%), low total alkali element contents (0. 50 - 1. 85 wt%), and MgO abundances 10 wt%. Transantarctic Mountain microtektites contain rare silica-rich (up to 93 wt% SiO 2) <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> similar to those found in two Australasian microtektites analyzed here for comparison. These inclusions are interpreted as partially digested, lechatelierite-like inclusions typically found in tektites and microtektites. The major and trace element (by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry) abundance pattern of the Transantarctic Mountain microtektites matches the average upper continental crust composition for most elements. Major deviations include a strong to moderate depletion in volatile elements including Pb, Zn, Na, K, Rb, Sr and Cs, as a likely result of severe volatile loss during the high temperature melting and vaporization of crustal target rocks. The normal and high-Mg Transantarctic Mountain microtektites have compositions similar to the most volatile-poor normal and high-Mg Australasian microtektites reported in the literature. Their very low H 2 O and B contents (by secondary ion mass spectrometry) of 85 ± 58 (1 sigma) ?g/g and 0. 53 ± 0. 21 ?g/g, respectively, evidence the extreme volatile loss characteristically observed in tektites. The Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of multigrain samples of Transantarctic Mountain microtektites are 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ~ 0. 71629 and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ~ 0. 51209, and fall into the Australasian tektite compositional field. The Nd model age calculated with respect to the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) is TNdCHUR ~ 1. 1 Ga, indicating a Meso-Proterozoic crustal source rock, as was derived for Australasian tektites as well. Coupled with the Quaternary age from the literature, the extended dataset presented in this work strengthens our previous conclusion that Transantarctic Mountain microtektites represent a major southward extension of the Australasian tektite/microtektite strewn field. Furthermore, the significant depletion in volatile elements (i. e., Pb, B, Na, K, Zn, Rb, Sr and Cs) of both normal and high-Mg Transantarctic Mountain microtektites relative to the Australasian ones provide us with further confirmation of a possible relationship between high temperature-time regimes in the microtektite-forming process and ejection distance...|$|R

40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions {{are driven by}} exsolution of H 2 O-rich vapour from silicic magma. Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano. This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route. Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible. Hitherto {{it has not been}} possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> trapped in plagioclase crystals to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H 2 O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H 2 O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of latent heat of crystallization. This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing...|$|R
40|$|Hypotheses for the {{formation}} of many types of hydrothermal ore deposits often involve the direct contribution of magma-related fluids (e. g., Cu-Mo-Au porphyries) or their superimposition on barren hydrothermal cells (e. g., volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposits). However, the chemical and phase compositions of such fluids remain largely unknown. We report preliminary results of a comprehensive study of fluid bubbles trapped inside <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> in primitive olivine phenocrysts and pillow-rim glasses from basaltic magmas from different tectonic environments, including mid-ocean ridges (Macquarie Island, SW Pacific and Mid-Atlantic Ridge 43 °N Fracture Zone), ocean islands (Hawaii) and a variety of modern and ancient backarc-island arc settings (eastern Manus Basin, Okinawa and Vanuatu Troughs, Troodos, New Caledonia and Hunter Ridge-Hunter Fracture Zone). Fluid bubbles from all localities, studied using electron microscopy with EDS and laser Raman spectroscopy, are composed of CO 2 -(± H 2 O ± sulfur) -bearing vapor and contain significant amounts of amorphous (Na-K-Ca-Fe alumino-silicates and dissorded carbon) and crystalline phases. The crystals are represented mainly by carbonates (magnesite, calcite, ankerite, dolomite, siderite, nahcolite and rhodochrosite), sulfates (anhydrite, gypsum, barite and anglesite), and sulfides (pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite and marcasite), though other minerals (brukite, apatite, halite, clinoenstatite, kalsilite, nepheline, amphibole and mica) may occur as well. We argue that chemical components (e. g., C, H, S, Cl, Si, Al, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ca, Mg, Ba, Pb and Cu) that later formed precipitates in fluid bubbles were originally dissolved in the magmatic fluid, and were not supplied by host glasses or phenocrysts after entrapment. Magma-related fluid rich in dissolved metals and other non-volatile elements may be a potential precursor to ore-forming solutions...|$|R
40|$|The Gorda ridge is an {{intermediate}} spreading center {{off the coast}} of Oregon and California that consists of 5 segments: N. Gorda, Jackson, Central, Phoenix, and Escanaba. Spreading rate decreases from 55 to 23 mm/yr from north to south. This decrease is reflected by a wider axial valley in the south. We examine how depths of crystallization vary along the Gorda Ridge using major element and volatile compositions of naturally <b>glassy</b> olivine-hosted melt <b>inclusions.</b> Olivine were hand-picked, polished, and mounted in indium for geochemical analysis. Volatiles were measured using the 1280 ion microprobe and major element contents were collected using an electron microprobe. Trace element contents were measured using the LA-ICP-MS. Samples containing the lowest MgO content have the highest variability in major element compositions. To model this variability, fractional crystallization models were run using MELTS. These models indicate that the melt inclusion compositions at each segment require multiple parent magmas. Depths of crystallization are determined using the volatile contents. Escanaba melt inclusions are best explained by crystallization at 2 kbars, while the other segments have a mean crystallization pressure of 1 kbar...|$|R
40|$|Mesoarchean Kola-Karelia {{continent}} in {{the eastern}} Fennoscandian Shield includes three tectonic provinces, Kola, Karelia and Belomoria, that were formed by the Paleoarchean and Mesoarchean microcontinents. Traces of Mesoarchean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) -type early crust were documented {{in all of the}} most ancient units of the Kola-Karelia continent. Ancient crust was revealed and dated in the Ranua and Iisalmi microcontinents, 3. 5 - 3. 4 Ga; Vodlozero and Khetolambina microcontinents, 3. 25 - 3. 15 Ga; Kuhmo-Segozero microcontinent, ~ 3. 0 Ga; Murmansk and Inari-Kola microcontinents, 2. 93 Ga; and Kianta microcontinent, 2. 83 - 2. 81 Ga. In the older (> 3. 0 Ga) tectonic units and microcontinents, the ancient crust was possibly formed in brief bursts of endogenic activity. In younger microcontinents (3. 0 – 2. 93 Ga), these processes could continue until 2. 8 and even 2. 72 Ga. The tectonic settings in which early TTG crust has been produced are largely uncertain. The primary melt <b>glassy</b> <b>inclusions</b> with a glass phase in cores of prismatic zircon crystals from TTG gneisses provide evidence for the volcanic origin of gneiss protolith. Suggested genetic modeling of TTG-type complexes assumes that felsic K-Na melts with positive Eu anomaly are a product of dry high-temperature partial melting of the previously formed mafic-to-felsic crustal rocks and/or thick older TTG crust. Positive Eu anomaly in the eutectic {{is directly related to the}} predominance of plagioclase and K-feldspar in the melt. TTG-type crust melted to produce granite-granodiorite (GG) rocks. Earliest microcontinents are separated by Mesoarchean greenstone belts (mainly 3. 05 - 2. 85 Ga, in some cases up to 2. 75 Ga), which are fragments of paleo-island-arc systems accreted to their margins: the Kolmozero-Voronya, Central Belomorian, Vedlozero-Segozero, Sumozero-Kenozero, and Tipasjärvi-Kuhmo-Suomussalmi belts; and the mature island arcs (microcontinents) : Khetolambina and Kovdozero. These structural units are characterized by significant extent, close to rectilinear trend, localization along the boundaries between Archean microcontinents, and a specific set of petrotectonic assemblages (basalt-andesite-rhyolite, komatiite-tholeiite, and andesite-dacite associations). The recently discovered Meso-Neoarchean Belomorian eclogite province that is structurally linked with the Central Belomorian greenstone belt contains two eclogite associations distributed within TTG gneisses: the subduction-type Salma association and the Gridino eclogitized mafic dikes. The protolith of the Salma eclogites is thought to have been a sequence of gabbro, Fe-Ti gabbro, and troctolite, formed at ca. 2. 9 Ga in a slow-spreading ridge (similar to the Southwest Indian Ridge). The main subduction and eclogite-facies events occurred between ca. 2. 87 and ca. 2. 82 Ga. Mafic magma injections into the crust of the active margin that led to formation of the Grigino dike swarm were associated with emplacement of a mid-ocean ridge in a subduction zone, beginning at ca. 2. 87 Ga. Crustal delamination of the active margin and subsequent involvement of the lower crust in subduction 2. 87 – 2. 82 Ga ago led to high-pressure metamorphism of the Gridino dikes that reached eclogite-facies conditions during a collision event between 2. 82 and 2. 78 Ga. This collision resulted in consolidation of the Karelia, Kola, and Khetolamba blocks and formation of the Mesoarchean Belomorian accretionary-collisional orogen. To date, the subduction-related Salma eclogites provide the most complete and meaningful information on the nature of plate tectonics in the Archean, from ocean-floor spreading to subduction and collision. The Kovdozero granite-greenstone terrain that separates the Khetolambina nd Kuhmo-Segozero microcontinents is formed by TTG granitoids and gneisses hosting metasediments and metavolcanics of several greenstone belts, which belonged to the Parandovo-Tiksheozero island arc that existed from ca. 2. 81 to 2. 77 Ga. The Iringora greenstone belt includes the ophiolite complex of the same name with an age of 2. 78 Ga. The collision of microcontinents resulted in the upward squeezing of the island arc and the obduction of its marginal portions onto surrounding structures. 74 page(s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSignificant zonation in major, minor, trace, and {{volatile}} elements {{has been documented}} in naturally <b>glassy</b> olivine-hosted melt <b>inclusions</b> from the Siqueiros Fracture Zone and the Galapagos Islands. Components with a higher concentration in the host olivine than in the melt (e. g., MgO, FeO, Cr 2 O 3, and MnO) are depleted {{at the edges of}} the zoned melt inclusions relative to their centers, whereas except for CaO, H 2 O, and F, components with a lower concentration in the host olivine than in the melt (e. g., Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, Na 2 O, K 2 O, TiO 2, S, and Cl) are enriched near the melt inclusion edges. This zonation is due to formation of an olivine-depleted boundary layer in the adjacent melt in response to cooling and crystallization of olivine on the walls of the melt inclusions, concurrent with diffusive propagation of the boundary layer toward the inclusion center. Concentration profiles of some components in the melt inclusions exhibit multicomponent diffusion effects such as uphill diffusion (CaO, FeO) or slowing of the diffusion of typically rapidly diffusing components (Na 2 O, K 2 O) by coupling to slow diffusing components such as SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3. Concentrations of H 2 O and F decrease toward the edges of some of the Siqueiros melt inclusions, suggesting either that these components have been lost from the inclusions into the host olivine late in their cooling histories and/or that these components are exhibiting multicomponent diffusion effects. A model has been developed of the time-dependent evolution of MgO concentration profiles in melt inclusions due to simultaneous depletion of MgO at the inclusion walls due to olivine growth and diffusion of MgO in the melt inclusions in response to this depletion. Observed concentration profiles were fit to this model to constrain their thermal histories. Cooling rates determined by a single-stage linear cooling model are 150 – 13, 000 °C h− 1 from the liquidus down to ~ 1, 000 °C, consistent with previously determined cooling rates for basaltic glasses; compositional trends with melt inclusion size observed in the Siqueiros melt inclusions are described well by this simple single-stage linear cooling model. Despite the overall success of the modeling of MgO concentration profiles using a single-stage cooling history, MgO concentration profiles in some melt inclusions are better fit by a two-stage cooling history with a slower-cooling first stage followed by a faster-cooling second stage; the inferred total duration of cooling from the liquidus down to ~ 1, 000 °C ranges from 40 s to just over 1 h. Based on our observations and models, compositions of zoned melt inclusions (even if measured at the centers of the inclusions) will typically have been diffusively fractionated relative to the initially trapped melt; for such inclusions, the initial composition cannot be simply reconstructed based on olivine-addition calculations, so caution should be exercised in application of such reconstructions to correct for post-entrapment crystallization of olivine on inclusion walls. Off-center analyses of a melt inclusion can also give results significantly fractionated relative to simple olivine crystallization. All melt inclusions from the Siqueiros and Galapagos sample suites exhibit zoning profiles, and this feature may be nearly universal in <b>glassy,</b> olivine-hosted <b>inclusions.</b> If so, zoning profiles in melt inclusions could be widely useful to constrain late-stage syneruptive processes and as natural diffusion experiments...|$|R
40|$|We report here {{compositions}} of <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> hosted in sapphires (gem quality corundum) {{from three}} alluvial deposits in Montana, USA including the Rock Creek, Dry Cottonwood Creek, and Missouri River deposits. While {{it is likely}} that sapphires in these deposits were transported to the surface by Eocene age volcanic events, their ultimate origin is still controversial with many models suggesting the sapphires are xenocrysts with a metamorphic or metasomatic genesis. Melt inclusions are trachytic, dacitic, and rhyolitic in composition. Microscopic observations allow separation between primary and secondary melt inclusions. The primary melt inclusions represent the silicate liquid that was present at the time of sapphire formation and are enriched in volatile components (8 – 14 wt. %). Secondary melt inclusions analyzed here for Dry Cottonwood Creek and Rock Creek sapphires are relatively volatile depleted and represent the magma that carried the sapphires to the surface. We propose that alluvial Montana sapphires from these deposits formed through a peritectic melting reaction during partial melting of a hydrated plagioclase-rich protolith (e. g. an anorthosite). The heat needed to drive this reaction was likely derived from the intrusion of mantle-derived mafic magmas near the base of the continental lithosphere during rollback of the Farallon slab around 50 Ma. These mafic magmas may have ended up as the ultimate carrier of the sapphires to the surface as evidenced by the French Bar trachybasalt near the Missouri River deposit. Alternatively, the trachytic, rhyolitic, and dacitic secondary melt inclusions at Rock Creek and Dry Cottonwood Creek suggests that the same magmas produced during the partial melting event that generated the sapphires may have also transported them to the surface. Determining the genesis of these deposits will further our understanding of sapphire deposits around the world and may help guide future sapphire prospecting techniques. This work is also important to help reveal the history of mantle-derived mafic magmas as they pass through the continental crust...|$|R

The suite displays a strong tholeiitic trend with K₂O < 1 [*]wt %. Phenocryst assemblages typically comprise plagioclase[*]+[*]clinopyroxene[*]±[*]orthopyroxene with microlites of Ti-magnetite. Olivine (Fo 83 – 88) is rare and believed to be dominantly antecrystic. An increase in the extent and frequency of reverse zoning in phenocrysts, sieve-textured plagioclase and the occurrence of antecrystic phases in post-caldera lavas record a shift to dynamic conditions, allowing the interaction of magma batches that were previously distinct. Pyroxene thermobarometry suggests crystallization at 950 – 1200 °C and 0 · 8 – 1 · 8 kbar. Volatile measurements of <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> indicate a maximum H₂O content of 4 · 16 [*]wt % H₂O, and CO₂–H₂O saturation curves indicate that crystallization occurred at two levels, at depths of 4 – 5 · 5 [*]km and 1 · 5 – 2 · 5 [*]km. Major and trace element models suggest that the compositions of the majority of the samples represent a differentiation trend whereby the dacite was produced by 65 % fractional crystallization of the most primitive basaltic andesite. Trace element models suggest that the sub-arc mantle source is the residuum of depleted Indian mid-ocean ridge basalt mantle (IDMM- 1 % melt), whereas radiogenic isotope data imply addition of 0 · 2 % average Tongan sediment melt and a fluid component derived from the subducted altered Pacific oceanic crust. A horizontal array on the U–Th equiline diagram and Ra excesses of up to 500 % suggest fluid addition to the mantle wedge within the last few thousand years.

40|$|The H 2 O and CO 2 {{contents}} of melt inclusions can potentially {{be used to}} infer pressures of crystallization and inclusion entrapment because the solubility of mixed H 2 O-CO 2 vapor has been determined experimentally {{for a wide range}} of melt compositions. However, melt inclusions commonly develop a shrinkage bubble during post-entrapment cooling and crystallization because these processes cause a pressure drop in the inclusion. This pressure drop causes a vapor bubble to nucleate, leading to exsolution of low-solubility CO 2 from the trapped melt. To investigate the loss of CO 2 into such bubbles, we experimentally heated large, naturally <b>glassy</b> melt <b>inclusions</b> in olivine (Fo {{contents of}} 88. 1 ± 0. 2) from a Mauna Loa picrite to rehomogenize the inclusions. Rapid heating to 1420 °C using a high-temperature heating stage dissolved the shrinkage bubbles into the melt. CO 2 contents measured by FTIR spectroscopy and recalculated for melt in equilibrium with the olivine host are 224 – 505 ppm (n = 11) for heated inclusions, much higher than the CO 2 contents of naturally quenched inclusions from the same sample (38 – 158 ppm; n = 8). Pressures of inclusion entrapment calculated from the H 2 O and CO 2 data for the heated inclusions range from 0. 5 to 1. 1 kbar, indicating that Mg-rich olivine crystallized at very shallow depths beneath the surface of Mauna Loa. Our results indicate that 40 – 90 % (average 75 %) of the original CO 2 dissolved in the melt at the time of inclusion entrapment can be lost to the shrinkage bubble during post-entrapment cooling. We show that the computational method of Riker (2005), which predicts the pre-eruption shrinkage bubble size as a function of the difference between trapping temperature and pre-eruption temperature, successfully reproduces our experimental results. Our results demonstrate that the mass of CO 2 contained in shrinkage bubbles must be considered to accurately infer original pressures of crystallization for melt inclusions. However, the effect is expected to be smaller for more H 2 O-rich melt inclusions than those studied here because the vapor bubble in such inclusions will have lower mole fractions of CO 2 than the low-H 2 O inclusions in our study...|$|R

Matrix melt and melt inclusions within the enclaves were quenched to glass upon eruption of the dacite. The glasses in the melt inclusions are interpreted as the remains of melt produced by an initial melting reaction involving a muscovite-rich assemblage at ≈ 700 – 750 °C, whereas the matrix glasses are consistent with continued melting and/or a later melt dominated by the incipient melting of biotite at ≈ 800 – 850 °C. The distribution of trace elements between residuum and melt during anatexis of the enclaves is different from that predicted by disequilibrium models that consider effective distribution coefficients close to unity.

The data were used to estimate composition of the parental melt and physicochemical parameters of the magma evolution. According to our data, the parental melt corresponded to low magnesium, high aluminum basalt (SiO 2 = 50. 2 %, MgO = 5. 6 %, Al 2 O 3 = 17 %) of the mildly potassium type (K 2 O = 0. 56 %) and contained much dissolved volatile components (H 2 O = 2. 8 %, S = 0. 17 %, and Cl = 0. 11 %). Melt inclusions in the minerals are similar in chemical composition, a fact testifying that the minerals crystallized simultaneously with one another. Their crystallization started at pressure ~ 1. 5 kbar, proceeded within a narrow temperature range of 1040 +/- 20 °C, and continued until near-surface pressure ~ 100 bar was reached. Degree of crystallization of the parental melt during its eruption was close to 55 %. Massive crystallization was triggered by H 2 O degassing under pressure < 1 kbar. Magma degassing in an open system resulted in escape of 82 % H 2 O, 93 % S, and 24 % Cl (of their initial contents in the parental melt) to the fluid phase. Release of volatile compounds to the atmosphere during the eruption that lasted for 18 h was estimated as 1. 7 x 10 ** 6 t H 2 O, 1. 4 x 10 ** 5 t S, and 1. 5 x 10 ** 4 t Cl. Concentrations of most incompatible trace elements in the melt inclusions are close to those in the rocks and to the expected fractional differentiation trend. Melt inclusions in plagioclase were found to be selectively enriched in Li.

40|$|To better {{constrain}} {{processes that}} operated {{prior to and}} during the dacite magma eruption of Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991, primary inclusions found in quartz phenocrysts of white dacite pumice have been studied by combining micro-analytical techniques with homogenisation experiments. Inclusion morphology and composition before and after homogenisation experiments performed in gas pressure vessels at 760 – 780 °C and 185 – 200 MPa distinguish two stages of magma degassing. During the first stage, which occurred prior to eruption, the host quartz trapped a fluid-saturated rhyolitic melt {{with an average of}} 78. 6 ± 0. 7 wt. % SiO 2, 12. 4 ± 0. 5 wt. % Al 2 O 3 and 7 ± 0. 3 wt. % H 2 O and a water-rich fluid. Microanalyses on the quartz-hosted multiphase and crystal inclusions indicate that the dacite magma crystallised at 750 ± 5 °C, an oxygen fugacity of 1. 5 – 1. 7 log fO 2 units above the NNO (nickel–nickel oxide) buffer, and a total pressure of 190 ± 50 MPa corresponding to depths from 4 to 7 km. In the second stage, which corresponds to the magma eruption and decompression to 12 – 23 MPa, volatile exsolution provoked decrepitation of unstable melt inclusions and the loss of initially high H 2 O contents from all > 80 μm <b>glassy</b> and Hourglass <b>inclusions</b> to 1. 7 ± 0. 3 wt. % H 2 O. The exsolution of 5 wt. % H 2 O from the dacite magma might have occurred at depths of 300 – 700 m due to vent blockage caused by the sudden collapse of the conduit walls. These conditions of the climactic eruption in combination with an extreme mass eruption rate reaching 2 × 109 kg s− 1 could create oscillations between convecting and collapsing columns, which explains the alternation of pyroclastic-flow deposits with plinian pumice-fall deposits reported in previous studies...|$|R
