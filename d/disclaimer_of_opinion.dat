The purpose of the {{research was}} to examine whether (1) changes in financial structure, (2) frequency of switching auditors, and (3) frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{could be used to}} discriminate between engagements which do or do not result in litigation. It was hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies would report significantly different changes in their financial structure during the four years preceding litigation. It was also hypothesized that litigate and nonlitigate companies could be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} frequency of switching auditors and frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> ^ The results indicate that litigate companies, as a group, grew at a faster rate in both asset base and cost of sales than their nonlitigate counterparts. There appeared to be no significant difference in the frequencies with which litigate and nonlitigate companies switched auditors. The results showed that litigate companies tended to have a higher frequency of qualifications to the audit report or <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> than nonlitigate companies. ^ The results of the research indicated that it may be possible to operationally define a benchmark which public accountants could use to assess the risk of litigation associated with specific engagements. ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Opinion,</b> {{commonly}} referred to simply as a Disclaimer, is issued when the auditor could not form and consequently refuses to present an opinion on the financial statements.

The report for USDA focused {{on a number of}} major management challenges, including enhancing financial management, and continued the high risk designation for Forest Service financial management. For many years, USDA struggled to improve its financial management activities, but inadequate accounting systems and related procedures and controls hampered its ability to get a clean opinion on its financial statements. After eight consecutive <b>disclaimers</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> USDA's Office <b>of</b> Inspector General issued an unqualified opinion on USDA's fiscal year 2002 financial statements and reported that significant progress had been made in improving overall financial management. For each of USDA's agencies that prepared separate financial statements for fiscal year 2002, the audit opinions were also positive. Specifically, unqualified audit opinions were issued on the financial statements of the Forest Service, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation/Risk Management Agency, Commodity Credit Corporation, the Rural Development mission area, and the Rural Telephone Bank. While we consider these clean opinions a positive step, some of these could not have been rendered without extraordinary efforts by the department and its auditors. Achieving financial accountability will require more than heroic efforts to obtain year-end numbers for financial statement purposes. Without reliable financial systems and sound internal controls, {{it is not possible to}} have sound data on a timely basis for decision making. Before USDA can achieve and sustain financial accountability, and thus be in a position to have reliable system-generated data as needed, it and its component agencies, particularly the Forest Service, must address a number of serious problems that USDA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or we have reported. ...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary Introduction This report {{sets out}} {{the results of}} the {{financial}} statement audits of the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services (DTIRIS) cluster agencies for the year ended 30 June 2014. Unqualified audit opinions were issued on 54 financial statements. One set of financial statements is outstanding and eight audits have not been completed for 30 June 2014. This includes the Water Administration Ministerial Corporation (WAMC) for which a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> may be issued when the signed financial statements are received. Comment on WAMC and incomplete audits appear later in this report. Entities in the Cluster DTIRIS is the State’s lead economic development agency. It achieves results by collaborating with and supporting businesses, industries and communities with respect to investment, trade, innovation, productivity and regional growth across all sectors. DTIRIS cluster agencies promote trade and investment locally and internationally, providing business support, technical knowledge, and science and research capabilities to industries. They also support the tourism, hospitality, racing and cultural sectors. Agencies work to secure and regulate energy and mineral resources for New South Wales, support food and fibre industries, and encourage natural resource management. We audited 63 agencies in the DTIRIS cluster. These agencies include nine Electricity and eight Water agencies which were reported on in the NSW Auditor-General’s report to Parliament Volume Five 2014. Two of those 2014 audits are ongoing. Commentary in this volume is on the remaining 46 DTIRIS cluster agencies...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{consensus}} among scholars that proper records management {{plays a significant role}} in the auditing process. Despite this role, in South Africa, many governmental bodies are issued with disclaimer opinions every year by the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA) due to a lack of supporting documentation. Whenever AGSA embarks on an audit assignment, the first constraint it faces is that records either do not exist or, if they do exist, are disorganised, and retrieval becomes problematic, resulting in a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Furthermore, many public organisations rarely see the connection between the lack of proper records management and failures of financial accountability. This article reports on part of doctoral research project by Ngoepe in 2012 that sought to develop a framework to embed the records management function into the auditing process. However, this article seeks to investigate the role of records management in the auditing process in the public sector of South Africa, with a view to entrenching a culture of clean audits. The study relied on both quantitative and qualitative approaches, with thequantitative paradigm as the dominant design, while the qualitative paradigm was used to substantiate numerical data. Data collection adopted a multi-approach with three key sources of data: a questionnaire, interviews and literature review. The results indicate that in most governmental bodies records management did not form part of the internal audit scope, hence many record-keeping issues were identified by external auditors at a later stage. The study revealed that most governmental bodies have established internal audit units, audit committees and records management units, which did not work in unison. The study concludes by arguing that proper records management is one of the key enablers of the auditing process. Information Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The 1997 peer review of the Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General (IG) done by the Environmental Protection Agency IG resulted in a qualified opinion. The peer review report questioned the quality assurance system used by the DOD IG {{and said that the}} reviewed audits did not fully comply with Government Auditing Standards. The 2000 peer review done by the Department of the Treasury IG for Tax Administration (TIGTA) also resulted in a unqualified opinion. Although TIGTA cited several problems, the peer review report concluded that the quality assurance system used by the DOD IG reasonably ensured compliance with auditing standards. However, after the peer review had been completed, a letter was sent to Congress, the press, and others questioning the integrity of the documentation that the DOD IG provided to the TIGTA peer review staff. A DOD IG internal investigation later confirmed that the work papers for one of the audits chosen for peer review had been altered and destroyed. The report concluded that these actions violated Government Auditing Standards, internal DOD IG audit policies, and the expectations of the external peer review staff. TIGTA then withdrew its 2000 peer review opinion and issued a <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> in May 2001, stating that it was unable to determine whether the substantiated allegations would materially affect the DOD IG's system of quality control. As a result, the DOD IG failed to meet the requirement that it obtain a peer review at least once every three years. The DOD IG began qualifying its audit reports to explain its lack of compliance with the peer review requirements set forth in Government Auditing Standards. The 2001 peer review done by the Department of Health and Human Services IG similarly resulted in a qualified opinion. The 2001 peer review report said that the DOD IG's quality assurance system needs improvement and that audits were not always in compliance with Government Auditing Standards. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{research}} area of Chinese auditing market, {{few studies have}} been conducted on the effects that auditor-related characteristics have on auditing quality. Thus, the paper is to examine the influences auditor-related attributes have on auditing quality, including size of the auditing firm, its income, and whether it is Big 4 or not. In addition to that, research topic on relationship between relationship between market concentration level and auditing quality is also an attractive one among {{the research}}ers. However, many studies on this subject is usually performed on a short-run periods and many suggest with a dominative market structure. Thus this paper wants to broaden the time period of data to have a larger sample base and thus to test the relationship between market concentration and auditing quality to see whether the government should promote dominative market structure or not. Therefore, this paper mainly investigates two subjects in the Chinese auditing market: 1) auditor-related attributes’ impact on auditing quality; 2) market concentration level and its impact on auditing quality. In auditor-related attributes’ impact on auditing quality study, Total Accruals, which is the sum of the changes in current assets, in cash and cash equivalents, in current liabilities, in the current portion of debt and plus the amount of depreciation and amortization, is adopted as the proxy of the auditing quality of a listed firm as a firm will have low earning quality when holding high accruals. The subsequent multiple regression model demonstrates that auditor-related attributes, such as auditor’s income, its size, and whether it is BIG 4 or not, are not determinants of earning quality and auditing quality in China’s auditing market. Then in market concentration level and its impact on auditing quality part, the market share of the top four largest and eight auditing firms in the four areas of No. of Customers, Customers’ Assets, Auditor’s Income and Customers’ Income is used to measure the market concentration level, and it is found that overall the Chinese auditing market is characterized by oligopolistic competition. And the BIG 4 are found to outperform domestic CPA firms, especially in premium client segment. Then using Qualified Opinion, Adverse Opinion and <b>Disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>Opinion</b> report as the proxy of good auditing work of an auditing firm, a reserve relationship is discovered by conducting regression analysis between concentration ratio and proxy of auditing quality. This indicates the need to reduce market concentration level in the Chinese auditing market so as to increase auditor’s auditing quality...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The Municipal Manager is {{responsible}} for the overall financial management of the municipality as requirement of MFMA. However, section 79 (1) of the MFMA makes a provision for the municipal manager to delegate the financial management to the senior manager. The legislative requires that all municipalities should appoint a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) who must {{be a member of the}} Senior Management of the municipality. The act, furthermore, requires the municipality to establish the budget and treasury office to be headed by the CFO. In 2007, the Minister of Finance released guidelines for the minimum competency requirement regulation of CFOs implemented on the first day of July 2007. According to the literature review, the CFO should move away from being number crunchers to become more visible in strategic and leadership management. Generally, according to the literature review, financial management within local municipalities in Gauteng is not properly managed. This was revealed in the general report on the audit outcomes of local government for the financial year ended 30 June 2003, 2004 and 2005. The summary of these reports shows that the Auditor-General expressed <b>disclaimer</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> to 50 % of the financial statements and 13. 1 % adverse opinion of the municipalities. The reports further revealed that most of the municipalities do not have effective internal risk management or internal audit departments, late submission of financial statements is rife, and failure to implement newly enacted legislation prevails. Therefore, the municipalities' overall financial management is not well managed. The data gathered from the municipalities by administering questionnaires show that the local municipalities' finances are properly managed and they have effective systems of internal control. The municipalities have internal audit or risk management departments, they have functional audit committees and lastly, they implement recommendations from the Auditor-General's office and internal audit diligently. Information from the Auditor-General's office contradicts the information received from municipalities. The researcher is biased towards accepting the Auditor-General's point of view since the Auditor-General has no reason to paint a good or bad picture about the municipalities. The problem presented is that the municipalities do not have welt-established governance structures in place, in the first place; secondly, the contradiction highlights the perceptions of the people involved with the day-to-day financial management about its effectiveness and the Auditor-General's opinion of it. To overcome the problems, municipalities are advised to include competency assessment in their job selection processes, develop their staff members, establish and implement succession planning, and adhere to the legislation and submission timeframes. It is further recommended that the municipalities should adhere to the policy framework and develop strategies that support enhanced service delivery, as well as to instill energy and thought to overcome loss of skill and expertise due to high staff turnover.
