25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, {{even though it had}} seemed to be settled in favor of the church in 1619. Though the regents <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
500|$|The film {{did not use}} any actors {{from the}} first two Jaws films. Roy Scheider, who played Police Chief Martin Brody {{in the first two}} films, laughed at the thought of Jaws 3, saying that [...] "Mephistopheles ... couldn't talk me into doing ... They <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> even ask". He agreed to do Blue Thunder to ensure his {{unavailability}} for Jaws 3-D.|$|E
500|$|In {{the race}} Oxbow broke third {{out of the}} gate and settled behind pacesetters Frac Daddy and Freedom Child, {{completing}} a quarter mile in 23 seconds. As usual, Oxbow wanted to run close to the front, Stevens <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> fight with him, and so, as in the Derby, horse and rider once again chased the speed horses at fractions described as [...] "suicidal". At the half-mile pole Oxbow was a neck off the leader, who clocked at 0:46.66, and on the backstretch, Oxbow went to the front, reaching the three-quarter mile mark at 1:10.95, running the second fastest half- and three-quarter mile fractions at that point in the race since Secretariat's 1973 record-setting performance. Oxbow was still in front by a half length at the mile post. At the top of the homestretch, Palace Malice and Oxbow were nose and nose but Oxbow tired, and finished second by three lengths to Palace Malice with Kentucky Derby winner Orb third, [...] lengths behind Oxbow. [...] His speed figure for the Belmont was 98, the same as in the Risen Star Stakes.|$|E

2500|$|As tsarevna, {{and then}} as tsarina, Maria Feodorovna had {{something}} of a social rivalry with the popular Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, wife of her Russian brother-in-law, Grand Duke Vladimir. This rivalry had echoed the one shared by their husbands, and served to exacerbate the rift within the family. While Maria Feodorovna <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> publicly criticise both the Grand Duke and Duchess in public, Marie Pavlovna had earned the caustic epithet of [...] "Empress Vladimir" [...] from the tsarina.|$|E
2500|$|Diehards on the {{committee}} <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> argue with Konstantin, but continued to use every means possible to provoke him by acting as a brake on progress. He faced a fractured group of representatives, divided between dedicated reformers intent on enacting the Emperor's reforms immediately, {{and a host of}} conservative aristocrat representatives who vehemently opposed the emancipation of the serfs. Konstantin was particularly scornful of the numerous aristocratic protests against his plan, commenting once that they were not even worthy for him to spit upon. On several occasions, Konstantin only just managed to keep the Committee from disintegrating under the strain. The post was a difficult one and the pressures wore on the Grand Duke. His enemies retaliated with ludicrous and poisonous gossip: [...] "Konstantin", they said, [...] "was insane, the result of too much masturbation".|$|E
2500|$|On December 20, 2010 Hamilton {{was arrested}} in Cleveland, Ohio after assaulting an officer. On February 11, 2011 Hamilton would post bail for $25,000 and was {{referred}} for psychiatric treatment. On March 6, 2015 during an interview Hamilton would go more into detail {{about what happened in}} that situation stating [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> punch a cop" [...] Hamilton had just crashed his father's girlfriend's car, which he took without permission or a drivers license. Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?. I said, Basketball. He puts his arms out to guard me, so I crossed him and he slipped. His partner came over like, What's going on? He grabbed my arm and I punched him." ...|$|E
