40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{the design and}} analysis of a new hybrid <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> with combined axial and radial flux rotors aiming to improve the poor performance characteristics of the conventional hysteresis motors such as the output torque and efficiency. The proposed hybrid design incorporates the advantageous features of both the conventional axial and radial flux hysteresis motors in a unique structure. The design aspects and constraints of the proposed machine {{are based on a}} sample single-sided axial flux <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor.</b> In order to analyze the electromagnetic performance of the proposed structure and investigate the geometry specifications of the designed machine, a 3 -D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is conducted. The hysteresis loop modeling is done based on the elliptical approximation of the hysteresis loop by considering the saturation during the FEA with an iterative method. Also, two analytical models are proposed to analyze the performance of the new hybrid <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor.</b> At the first method, in order to analyze the electromagnetic performance of the proposed machine and investigate the geometry specifications of the designed machine, the structure is divided into two axial and radial planes and the Laplace's equation are solved in 2 -D Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates for the field in the air-gap, the stator and the rotor disc subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The field equation is modified by the hyperbolic approximation of the hysteresis loop to investigate the effects of the minor loops described by the harmonic components of the field and then, the impact of the Magneto Motive Force (MMF) harmonics on the machine performance is estimated by an iterative approach. Afterward, the closed-form expressions for the developed torque are obtained in both planes and the results are stacked-up linearly by considering the basic of the superposition theorem. At the second method, the analysis of an axial flux <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> is investigated based on the parallelogram approximation of the hysteresis loop. This model is widely used in the analysis of the conventional <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> when the magnetic equivalent circuit method is employed. Because of the lack of analysis for the slotted stator, the magnetic analysis of a sample single-sided type is presented and the results of the analysis are extended to the hybrid structure. Then the yielded results are compared with the tests on a prototype. In this study, the effect of stator slotting, slot opening, and parasitic loss on the machine performance are investigated. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the magnetic and geometric parameters of the machine is evaluated. Finally, in order to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the proposed device and the accuracy of the design and analysis approach, a prototype is built.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, modeling, implementation, {{and control of}} a magnetically suspended reaction sphere with one-axis hysteresis drive (1 D-MSRS). The goal of this project is two fold: (a) exploring the design for a reaction sphere in 3 D for spacecraft's attitude control, and (b) studying {{the performance of the}} <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> in reaction wheel applications. The 1 D-MSRS is a motor with a spherical rotor with its rotor magnetically suspended in all translational directions, and is driven about the vertical axis by hysteresis drive. The magnetic suspension of the sphere is realized by arranging one electromagnet on top of the sphere, and a bearingless motor on the equator of the sphere. In this thesis, a complete mathematical model for the sphere's magnetic suspension, in both vertical and lateral directions, is derived. There is a good match between the calculated and measured system dynamics, which verified our modeling. The feedback control for the sphere's magnetic suspension in all translation degrees of freedom are studied in this thesis as well. The hysteresis drive is chosen for the 1 D-MSRS because its advantages of simple structure, moderate self-starting toque, and vibration-free operation. The <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> in 1 D-MSRS consists of a conventional stator arranged on the sphere's equator and a spherical rotor of magnetically hard steel. In this thesis, an equivalent circuit model of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> based on an elliptical hysteresis model is used to analyze the motor's dynamic behavior. Good agreement between computed and measured sphere speed data validated the motor model. Experimental data shows that a starting torque of 8. 15 mNm is achieved at 0. 7 A peak excitation current. Under this excitation, the sphere arrives synchronous speed of 1, 800 rpm within 6 s. The sphere can reach 12, 000 rpm in lab, with the existence of air drag. In order to suppress the hunting dynamics of the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor,</b> a feedback control loop on the sphere's rotational speed is implemented on the 1 D-MSRS. A control scheme is designed for this nonlinear system, and its effectiveness is validated by both simulation and experiment. Through this speed feedback control, the 1 D-MSRS can reach a minimum speed rise time while satisfying the constraints on its excitation amplitude, showing lower power consumption during steady state, and the hunting dynamics of the motor are effectively suppressed. As a result, when the motor is operating in steady state with a speed of 1, 800 rpm, the power consumption of the 1 D-MSRS hardware is 3. 44 W. In this thesis, we also explored the design concepts for a magnetically suspended reaction sphere in 3 D. A study of 3 D spherical motors are presented in this thesis.

This thesis examines the cause of hunting by deriving the motor's torque characteristics from first principles. It also derives a scheme for suppressing hunting by monitoring the motor's current as an indicator of drag angle and using it to modulate the motor's drive frequency. Explanation of the circuit that successfully implements this scheme is included and lab results are shown to verify the working theory. by Cang Kim Truong. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Part 15 : Energy: Power Conversion IInternational audienceThe {{discovery}} of the superconductivity and the understanding of electromagnetic properties of high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials allowed the optimization and development of several applications, such as electrical machines and drives. Electromechanical conversion devices based in HTS materials potentially allows for reduction in devices dimensions or performance improvement for the same active volume, when compared with their conventional ones. An axial disc motor with high temperature superconductor (HTS) material or conventional aluminium in the rotor and conventional armature has been designed and developed. This paper describes simulations and laboratory experiments performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) in order to analyze the motor’s behaviour and its electromechanical characteristics and to define an electric equivalent circuit that allows describing its operation. From the obtained results {{it was observed that}} the tested HTS behaves as a conventional <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> even though with a different nature. On the other hand, the motor with aluminium rotor behaves as a conventional induction motor. In asynchronous regime, the HTS motor exhibits a constant torque, higher than the conventional aluminium one...|$|E

The lubricants {{were placed in}} the rolling element bearings of <b>hysteresis</b> synchronous <b>motors</b> and exposed to environments of a vacuum at 60 C, a vacuum at 93. 3 C, 10 psia oxygen at 90 percent relative humidity at 60 C, 14. 7 psia air at 90 percent relative humidity at 60 C, start-stop operation, and low temperature start capability for one or five years. The weights of the bearings were measured before and after lubrication; the weight data for each environment are analyzed.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of suitable drive technologies {{for use in}} a new high-speed machining spindle was performed to determine critical research areas. The focus is on a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> topology using a solid, inherently-balanced D 2 steel shaft. An analytical model of the motor is devised in order to make performance predictions and optimization, and an experimental apparatus is constructed in order to verify the predictions of the model and investigate speed limits. The model's limitations due to a still-incomplete understanding of the vector hysteresis properties of magnetic steels are noted, and a proposal for an experiment to resolve this limitation is presented. The model predicts that the motor performance is optimized for a very thin ring of hysteretic steel. The experimental apparatus used a solid rotor. It was run up to a speed of 11, 000 RPM and torque-speed curves with various drive parameters are measured. by Jacob D. Bayless. Thesis: S.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} new design for superconducting linear motor (SLM). This SLM uses stacks of second generation (2 G) superconducting tapes, which {{are responsible for}} replacing YBCO bulks. The proposed SLM may operate as a synchronous motor or as a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor,</b> depending on the load force magnitude. A small scale linear machine prototype with 2 G stacks was constructed and tested to investigate the proposed SLM topology. The stator traveling magnetic field wave was represented by several Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. A relative movement was produced between the stator and the stack, and the force was measured along the displacement. This system was also simulated by finite element method, in order to calculate the induced currents in the stack and determine the electromagnetic force. The H-formulation was used {{to solve the problem}} and a power law relation was applied {{to take into account the}} intrinsically nonlinearity of the superconductor. The simulated and measured results were in accordance. Simulated results were extrapolated, proving to be an interesting tool to scale up the motor in future projects. The proposed motor presented an estimated force density of almost 500 N/kg, which is much higher than any linear motor.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the design, implementation {{and control of}} {{a new class of}} self-bearing motors. The primary thesis contributions include the design and experimental demonstration of hysteresis self-bearing motors, novel segmented stator structures, MIMO loop shaping control algorithm for levitation and commutation, <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> analysis including frequency dependency, nonlinear hysteresis model including loop widening, and a novel single-axis self-bearing motor, as well as a zero power configuration for this type of motor. In the late 1980 s, the basic concepts of self-bearing motors was proposed. Since then, different types of AC and DC electric machines have been studied as a self-bearing motor. The self-bearing system is a key technology for high efficiency and compact systems with integrated magnetic levitation for high speed and high precision applications. One of the major disadvantages of existing self-bearing motors for high speed application is their rotor mechanical construction. Either the permanent magnet or induction machines rotor has mechanical features that introduces stress concentrations. Permanent magnets have very low mechanical strength and need to be inserted into the rotor. The assembly of magnets makes rotor vulnerable to mechanical failure at high speed. On the other hand, induction motors use soft steel to reduce hysteresis loss. Their rotors are slotted to either carry wires or in case of squirrel cages, having aluminum or copper bars. As a promising alternative, this thesis demonstrates hysteresis self-bearing motors which have a simple construction with a solid and smooth rotor. This is a very important characteristic for some applications. This type of system can also be used as a magnetic bearing that can apply a finite amount of torque. The rotor doesn't have to be laminated and can be made from high strength steel. We designed, built and tested this type of self-bearing motor successfully. In this thesis we also introduced a new type of segmented stator for hysteresis machines. The major advantages of this stator are: easy and low cost manufacturing, higher filling factor and higher motor efficiency. We tested the self-bearing concept successfully with this new configuration. We have also introduced a novel single axis self-bearing motor that is very suitable for rotors with large length to diameter aspect ratio, such as high speed flywheels for energy storage. We implemented a zero power levitation condition along with passive damping for this system that has several advantages for high speed systems. One of the major advantages of zero power systems is the simple and robust touch down bearing design which is a key element for active magnetic bearings and self-bearing motors. This is mainly because the bearings experience minimal load in case of power failure. Hysteresis is a time-rate dependent phenomena which is fundamentally related to eddy current formation in the material and the thermal agitation. Hysteresis loops of materials with large hysteresis are highly frequency dependent. Therefore we added hysteresis frequency dependency to <b>hysteresis</b> <b>motor</b> analysis, which is believed to be a novel contribution. We have also developed linear and nonlinear analyses for the stabilizing forces and moments for hysteresis self-bearing motor. The nonlinear analysis is based on Chua's nonlinear hysteresis model that includes loop widening. The theoretical results were verified by experimental data for three different type motor configurations with good accuracy. Finally, we built two identical induction machines except for the rotor material. One rotor is a commercial squirrel cage and the other one is a simple solid rotor made out of hysteresis material(D 2 steel). We ran the IEEE standard tests for these motors and compared their performance under different circumstances. by Mohammad Imani Nejad. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Vector control method provides significant improvement to the dynamic performance of ac motors but in this method d- axis current is controlled such as the ratio of motor torque to motor current is a maximum, then the dynamic performance will be very fast. Furthermore, d and q axis currents are limited such as stator winding currents remain in the allowed range.
