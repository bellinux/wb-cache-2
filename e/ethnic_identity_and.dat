These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet attempts, {{which started}} after 1924 and were fully {{implemented}} after 1940, to strongly emphasize the local Moldovan identity and {{transform it into}} a separate ethnicity, {{as well as its}} reiteration in the post-independence Moldovan politics, especially during the Communist government (2001–2009), {{is often referred to as}} Moldovanism. The Moldovanist position refutes the purported Romanian-Moldovan <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> also at times the existence of a common language. US historian James Stuart Olson, in his book – An Ethnohistorical dictionary of the Russian and Soviet empires – considers that Moldovans and Romanians are so closely related to the Romanian language, ethnicity and historical development that they can be considered one and the same people.|$|E

The eviction of Muslim residents happened in the north in 1990, and the east in 1992. The expulsion of Muslims {{had more to do}} with disagreements over <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> politics than with religion as the Sri Lankan Muslims did not support the LTTE or the creation of an independent Tamil state and they do not identify with the ethnic Tamils despite being a Tamil-speaking people. The LTTE also saw Muslims as a threat to 'national security' as they alleged their Muslim cadres had defected from their movement to join the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary forces who were allegedly responsible for attacks on Tamil civilians.|$|E
25|$|Bulgarian Millet or Bulgar Millet was an ethno-religious and {{linguistic}} community within the Ottoman Empire from the mid-19th to early 20th century. Initially {{as a separate}} Millet were recognized the Bulgarian Uniates, and then the Bulgarian Orthodox Christians (Eksarhhâne-i Millet i Bulgar). At that time the classical Ottoman Millet-system began to degrade with the continuous identification of the religious creed with <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> the term millet {{was used as a}} synonym of nation. In this way, in the struggle for recognition of a separate Church, the modern Bulgarian nation was created. The establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870, meant in practice recognition of a separate Bulgarian nationality, and in this case the religious affiliation became a consequence of national allegiance. The founding of an independent church, along with the revival of Bulgarian language and education, were the crucial factors that strengthened the national consciousness and revolutionary struggle, that {{led to the creation of}} an independent nation-state in 1878.|$|E
25|$|The deteriorating {{climate in}} Scandinavia around 850 BC, that further {{deteriorated}} around 650 BC, might have triggered migration of Germanic tribes from the North. By {{the time this}} migration was complete, around 250 BC, a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged. The North Sea Germanic Ingvaeones inhabited {{the northern part of}} the Low Countries. They would later develop into the Frisii and the early Saxons. A second grouping, the Weser-Rhine Germanic (or Istvaeones), extended along the middle Rhine and Weser and inhabited the Low Countries south of the great rivers. This group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the Salian Franks. Also the Celtic La Tène culture (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest) had expanded over a wide range, including the southern area of the Low Countries. Some scholars have speculated that even a third <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> language, neither Germanic nor Celtic, survived in the Netherlands until the Roman period, the Iron Age Nordwestblock culture, that eventually was being absorbed by the Celts to the south and the Germanic peoples from the east.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore how second-generation young adults with foreign {{background}} understand their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> how they relate to their national identities. Semi-structured interviews with 7 second-generation young adults with foreign background were conducted. The basis for our analysis was social identity theory, <b>identity</b> theory <b>and</b> previous research. As the result shows, the participants in this study had developed an understanding of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in relation to their national identities based on influential factors. The influential factors that elicited these understandings of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in relation to their national identities were: influential people and cultural influences. On the basis of these influential factors, it had become easier for some participants to identify themselves more with their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities.</b> However, for other participants, the understanding of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> did not influence their feelings of belongingness to the host society, which means they have considered themselves to belong to both their <b>ethnic</b> <b>and</b> national <b>identities.</b> For those participants who could not identify themselves with both their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> relate to their national identities chose to identify themselves with something else, which in this case religion. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{creation}} of Czechoslovakia in 1918 was {{the culmination of}} a struggle for <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> self-determination that had simmered within the multi-national empire ruled by the Austrian Habsburg family in the 19th century. The Czechs had lived primarily in Bohemia since the 6th century, and German immigrants had settled the Bohemian periphery since the 13th century. After 1526, Bohemia came {{under the control of the}} House of Habsburg as their scions first became the elected rulers of Bohemia, then the hereditary rulers of the country. Following the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, the Kingdom of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy as one of its three principal parts, alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. With the rise of nationalist political and cultural movements in the Czech lands (the Czech National Revival) and the Slovak lands (the Slovak National Revival instigated by Ľudovít Štúr), mounting ethnic tensions combined with repressive religious and ethnic policies (such as the forced Magyarization of Slovaks) pushed the cohesion of the multi-national Austro-Hungarian Empire ruled by the Habsburgs to the breaking point.|$|E

The issue of how immigrants fare in the host country {{especially in terms of}} their labor force participation and remuneration has been the core of research in the labor migration literature. If immigrants fare as well as the natives, then they are economically assimilated. While some immigrant groups do, most do not, especially in Europe. Of equal importance is how immigrants identify with the culture of their home and receiving countries, and if natives and immigrants have the right attitudes about each other. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> attitudes seem to be less affected by the economic environment but have implications for economic performance. ethnicity, <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity,</b> acculturation, migrant assimilation, migrant integration, work, cultural economics...|$|R

500|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} by the Center for American Progress summarizing the research on [...] "The Real Impact of Native Mascots and Team Names on American Indian and Alaska Native Youth", a case is made that the public debate misses the point, since individual opinions on either side do not matter given the measurable effects on {{the mental health of}} Native American young people exposed to such misrepresentations of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> the often hostile or insulting behavior of non-natives that occur when teams with such names and mascots play. Clinical Psychologist Michael Friedman writes that the use of Native imagery, in particular the use of a dictionary defined slur, is a form of bullying, the negative impact of which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned.|$|E

While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses {{at a number of}} universities including New York University (2012), Yale University (2013), and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).
