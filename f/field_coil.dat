25|$|This is {{an older}} type of {{regulator}} {{used in the}} 1920s that uses the principle of a fixed-position <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> and a second <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> that can be rotated on an axis in parallel with the fixed coil, similar to a variocoupler.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E
25|$|The Bellini–Tosi system {{feeds the}} output voltage of a loop or Adcock antenna {{into a small}} coil of wire, the <b>field</b> <b>coil.</b> The varying voltage induced by the {{received}} signal causes the wire to re-radiate the same signal. Although as the coil is typically very {{much smaller than the}} wavelength and thus has a small antenna factor, the use of many loops of wire in the coil improves the overall signal strength. The total energy radiated by the coil is less than what is received on the antenna, but it broadcasts this into a much smaller physical area, so the flux may be much higher than the original signal.|$|E
25|$|Two {{antennae}} and two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are used, both arranged {{at right}} angles to each other. The area between the two <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> is filled with an analog of the original signal from the antennae. The sense coil, another loop antenna, is placed in the area between the <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Rotating the sense <b>coil</b> in the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> has the same output as rotating the entire loop antenna in the original field.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} wound motor, the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are {{connected}} electrically {{in series with}} the armature coils (via the brushes). In a shunt wound motor, the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are connected in parallel, or [...] "shunted" [...] to the armature coils. In a separately excited (sepex) motor the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are supplied from an independent source, such as a motor-generator and the field current is unaffected by changes in the armature current. The sepex system was sometimes used in DC traction motors to facilitate control of wheelslip.|$|R
50|$|Heliotron: A {{stellarator}} {{in which}} a helical coil is used to confine the plasma, together {{with a pair of}} poloidal <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> to provide a vertical <b>field.</b> Toroidal <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> {{can also be used to}} control the magnetic surface characteristics. The Large Helical Device in Japan uses this configuration.|$|R
25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a <b>field</b> <b>coil,</b> was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary <b>field</b> <b>coil,</b> perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument {{can be made to}} register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotating}} armature {{consists of}} one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, magnetically [...] "soft" [...] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a <b>field</b> <b>coil),</b> as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} ways to produce the {{magnetic}} field used in the alternators, by using permanent magnets which create their own persistent magnetic field or by using <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called magnetos. In other alternators, wound <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> form an electromagnet to produce the rotating magnetic field.|$|R
2500|$|Engineers {{invented the}} first loud, {{powerful}} amplifier and speaker systems for public address systems and movie theaters. These large PA systems and movie theatre sound systems were {{very large and}} very expensive, and so {{they could not be}} used by most touring musicians. After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered PA systems that could be plugged into a regular wall socket [...] "quickly became popular with musicians"; indeed, [...] "...Leon McAuliffe (with Bob Wills) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935." [...] During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable PA systems and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a [...] "single volume control and one or two input jacks, <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> speakers" [...] and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch.|$|E
2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils, as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by [...] "recharging" [...] the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.|$|E

Single-phase AC motors may follow either of these patterns: small motors are usually universal motors, like the brushed DC motor with a commutator, but run from AC. Larger AC motors are generally induction motors, whether these are three- or single-phase.|$|R

50|$|While now uncommon, <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> {{loudspeakers}} {{were once}} common in top quality mantel radios and similar domestic audio applications, {{particularly in the}} post-war period of World War II.

50|$|Continuous {{speed control}} of a {{universal}} motor running on AC is easily obtained by use of a thyristor circuit, while multiple taps on the <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC).|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} path {{is characterized by}} poles, locations at equal angles around the rotor at which the magnetic field lines pass from stator to rotor or vice versa. The stator (and rotor) are classified {{by the number of}} poles they have. Most arrangements use one <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> per pole. Some older or simpler arrangements use a single <b>field</b> <b>coil</b> with a pole at each end.|$|E
50|$|In a {{rotating}} machine, the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are wound on an iron magnetic core which guides {{the magnetic field}} lines. The magnetic core is in two parts; a stator which is stationary, and a rotor, which rotates within it. The magnetic field lines pass in a continuous loop or magnetic circuit from the stator through the rotor and back through the stator again. The <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> {{may be on the}} stator or on the rotor.|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{voltage control}} device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the stationary armature coils drops {{due to an}} increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> through the voltage regulator (VR). This increases the magnetic field around the <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils. Thus, the output voltage is brought back up to its original value.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} generator or electric motor {{consists of a}} rotor spinning in a magnetic field. The magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets or by <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> In {{the case of a}} machine with <b>field</b> <b>coils,</b> a current must flow in the coils to generate the field, otherwise no power is transferred to or from the rotor. The process of generating a magnetic field by means of an electric current is called excitation.|$|R

5000|$|Modern {{generators}} with <b>field</b> <b>coils</b> are self-excited, {{where some}} of the power output from the rotor is used to power the <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> The rotor iron retains a magnetism when the generator is turned off. The generator is started with no load connected; the initial weak field creates a weak voltage in the stator coils, which in turn increases the field current, until the machine [...] "builds up" [...] to full voltage.|$|R
40|$|The center {{column of}} the PLT machine is a {{secondary}} support member for the toroidal <b>field</b> <b>coils.</b> Its {{purpose is to}} decrease the bending moment at {{the nose of the}} coils.
