5000|$|The <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> (Trogoderma granarium), {{also called}} cabinet beetle, which {{originated}} in South Asia, {{is one of}} the world’s most destructive pests of grain products and seeds. It {{is considered one of the}} 100 worst invasive species in the world. [...] Infestations are difficult to control because of the insect's ability to survive without food for long periods, its preference for dry conditions and low-moisture food, and its resistance to many insecticides. There is a federal quarantine restricting the importation of rice into the U.S,. from countries with known infestations of the beetle. <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> infestation can spoil otherwise valuable trade goods and threaten significant economic losses if introduced to a new area. Handling or consuming contaminated grain and seed products can lead to health issues such as skin irritation and gastrointestinal distress.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle’s</b> {{physiology}} {{is significantly}} impacted by its diet.

40|$|Species can {{sometimes}} spread significant distances beyond their natural dispersal ability by anthropogenic means. International shipping routes and {{the transport of}} shipping containers, in particular are a commonly recognised pathway for the introduction of invasive species. Species can gain access to a shipping container and remain inside, hidden and undetected for long periods. Currently, government biosecurity agencies charged with intercepting and removing these invasive species when they arrive to a county's border only assess the most immediate point of loading in evaluating a shipping container's risk profile. However, an invasive species could have infested a container previous to this point and travelled undetected before arriving at the border. To assess arrival risk for an invasive species requires analysing the international shipping network {{in order to identify}} the most likely source countries and the domestic ports of entry where the species is likely to arrive. We analysed an international shipping network and generated pathway simulations using a first-order Markov chain model to identify possible source ports and countries for the arrival of <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> (Trogoderma granarium) to Australia. We found Kaohsiung (Taiwan) and Busan (Republic of Korea) to be the most likely sources for <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> arrival, while the port of Melbourne was the most likely point of entry to Australia. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant stability in the rankings of foreign and Australian ports.

40|$|Most of Australia’s {{agricultural}} produce is exported. Demonstrating freedom from certain {{plant and animal}} pests and diseases is critical to securing and maintaining market access. Surveillance is an important tool in gaining market access and accordingly exporting countries now need to provide accurate, credible evidence to confirm pest freedom status. In the past nearly all field-collected surveillance information was recorded manually to paper reducing the rate of capture, integrity, conformity as well as security of the data. This paper describes the development of pest surveillance data collection software and hardware using PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) to provide auditing, validation, chain of evidence and increase the volume of data collected {{as well as its}} integrity through relational databases and seamless data transfer to corporate systems. The system’s first deployment was during a T. granarium eradication. The <b>khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> (Trogoderma granarium) {{is one of the most}} serious pests of stored grain and is a regulated quarantine pest in most countries around the world. In April 2007, there was a post-border detection of T. granarium larvae and adults in a Western Australian residence. Immediate and uncompromising action was taken to quarantine the home and fumigate it with methyl-bromide at an internationally established rate known to control T. granarium (AQIS T 9056). A two-year T. granarium trapping program was undertaken which used PDA software to provide evidence of complete eradication via 1273 trap inspections.

40|$|Initial {{detection}} of plant pests (includes diseases) is often {{made by the}} growers and consultants that work directly with crops; this form of detection {{is referred to as}} general surveillance. General surveillance activities have an important role in plant biosecurity for the early {{detection of}} pests and for demonstrating area freedom. In the Western Australian grains industry, reports of suspect high priority pests to the state Department of Agriculture and Food is the main form of general surveillance. There is little information on the level of knowledge of high priority pests in the grains industry in Western Australia and the ability of members to detect high priority pests if they were present. This study details a survey of members of the grains industry to determine their knowledge of the signs of high priority grains pests and the likelihood that they would detect a high priority pest if it were present in grain or crops. Knowledge of the signs of the high priority grain diseases, Karnal bunt and Barley stripe rust, were found to be higher than those of the high priority insect pests, <b>Khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> and Russian wheat aphid.

40|$|Local {{potential}} competitor species are important determinants of the invasibility of an environment even when widely recognized invasive species are concerned since it may compromise its establishment. Thus, {{the outcome of}} the direct competition among the invasive <b>khapra</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trogoderma granarium, and the cosmopolitan species lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae, and thus the likelihood of establishment of T. granarium under their co-occurrence, was here explored in paddy rice and wheat, at temperatures between 25 and 35 °C and through 200 days of storage. Insect infestations were higher in wheat rather than in paddy rice. Trogoderma granarium was unable to displace any of the competing species under two and three-species competition experiments retaining lower adult population than both local competitors at the lowest temperature level. Rhyzopertha dominica prevailed in paddy rice, while S. oryzae prevailed in wheat. Paradoxically, T. granarium adults retained low population growth but contributed more for the total frass production and grain loss, much more than that recorded for R. dominica. Nonetheless, T. granarium larvae exhibited high population numbers 130 days after the introduction of the parental individuals. At higher temperature levels (30 and 35 °C) the numbers of T. granarium larvae were extremely high even after 65 days, while the numbers of the other two species rapidly declined. Interestingly, the simultaneous presence of R. dominica and S. oryzae was beneficial for the population growth of T. granarium. Consequently, T. granarium has the ability to outperform other primary stored-product insects at high temperatures, while its presence at low temperatures remains for long periods apparently unaffected by other co-occurring species. Hence, T. granarium, in wheat, is able to outcompete other major species of stored-product insects at elevated temperatures, while at 25 °C this species can maintain low numbers of individuals for long periods, which can rapidly produce population outbursts when the prevailing conditions are suitable for its development...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory bioassays were {{conducted}} to evaluate alpha-cypermethrin and thiamethoxam for the control of adults, small larvae and large larvae of the <b>khapra</b> <b>beetle</b> Trogoderma granarium, and {{the yellow mealworm beetle}} Tenebrio molitor, on concrete. Factors such as dose (0. 025 and 0. 1 mg alpha-cypermethrin or thiamethoxam/cm(2)), exposure interval (1, 3 and 7 d), and formulation (alpha-cypermethrin SC and thiamethoxam WG) were evaluated. Apart from immediate assessment at end of exposure, an assessment of delayed mortality was performed with the survivors of the 7 -d exposure by removing them from the treated substrate and keeping them on untreated surfaces for 7 more days. After the 7 -d exposure, more T. granarium adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. Small larvae were generally less susceptible than adults. After 7 d, small larval mortality reached 64. 4 % for alpha-cypermethrin, while for thiamethoxam it was < 6 %. Large T. granarium larvae were more tolerant than the small ones. Delayed mortality of T. granarium adults was generally high for both insecticides and doses, and ranged between 43. 3 and 63. 3 % of those that were still alive immediately after the 7 -d treatment. For both larval categories, delayed mortality was higher for larvae that had been previously exposed to alpha-cypermethrin, than with thiamethoxam. For T. molitor, after the 7 -d exposure, significantly more adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. For small larvae mortality was 38. 9 % at the lowest thiamethoxam dose, but in the other cases ranged between 88. 9 and 95. 6 %. In the case of large larvae, the overall mortality was low in all tested combinations. Regarding delayed mortality of this species, it remained at low levels, for both adults and small larvae. Our results indicate that 7 : molitor was more susceptible than T. granarium in both insecticides tested, but alpha-cypermethrin was more effective than thiamethoxam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Wheat crop {{occupies}} 			a central {{position in}} agriculture sector and our national economy. 			Pakistan contribution toward global wheat production is about 3. 2 			percent. The Punjab province is leading producer of wheat with a 			share {{of more than}} 70 {{percent of the total}} wheat production of the 			country. Despite being an agricultural country, food security of 			Pakistan has remained at stake since long because of poor yield and 			high post harvest losses caused by the storage pests. On the other 			hand country has a great exporting potential not only to achieve 			Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) relating to food security and 			safety but can earn foreign exchange and pay off country 			entire debts within 10 years just equaling our yield to that of 			Indian Punjab. 			Present investigations were, therefore, carried out to explore these 			potentials in terms of reducing post-harvest losses, food security 			and safety risks caused by the storage pests particularly the <b>Khapra</b> 			<b>beetle</b> which is a notified quarantine pest internationally. The 			studies revealed an average loss of 15. 5 percent when 10 pairs of 			Khapra larvae were released for a period of 6 months under the 			natural conditions. Similarly there were found 33 and 8 percent 			increase in number of weeviled and broken grains, respectively. 			Besides, the beetle depleted approximately 4 percent carbohydrates 			that resulted in 0. 35 and 1 percent increase in ash and crude fiber 			contents, respectively. Although total protein and fat percentages 			were slightly increased, yet these increases were predominantly due 			to the percentage loss of carbohydrates as well as production of 			protein aceous by-products of live insects, insect fragments, and 			excreta etc., which could not be sieved from the samples before 			chemical analysis. Further analysis of about 400 samples drawn from 			the entire province revealed that quality of Punjab wheat not only 			meets the international standards rather it is superior in many 			characteristics including protein content, moisture, bulk density, 			foreign matter, falling number. However, presence of quarantine 			pests such as T. granarium, Tilletia spores and Striga weeds render 			it unmarketable in the quality conscious world. A compatible grading 			system at the time of procurement and phytosanitary management of 			quarantine pests may guarantee vast acceptance of our wheat in the 			international market. Present research involved phytosanitary 			management of T. granarium with controlled and modified atmospheres 			(CA and MA) which have worldwide recognition as residuefree methods 			of insect control in warehouses, flourmills and granaries. Carbon 			dioxide and nitrogen base CAs proved effective in controlling T. 			granarium as well as the secondary insect pests, such as T. 			castaneum and S. granarius. The results revealed 100 percent control 			of T. granarium when exposed to 99 percent carbon dioxide based 			controlled atmosphere for 384 hours at 30 °C. The exposure time for 			complete mortality of T. castaneum and S. granarius was reduced to 			 96 hours under the similar conditions. The Khapra larvae were found 			to be the most resistant pests followed by S. granarius and T. 			castaneum. Carbon dioxide concentrations, exposure times and 			temperature significantly influenced mortality of the target pests. 			Higher values of these factors resulted in enhanced mortality and 			vice versa. We found a liberty to select these factors according to 			our ease and available resources to get a specific level of 			mortality. Likewise nitrogen based controlled atmosphere also proved 			effective, though time required to kill was higher as compared to 			Carbon dioxide based CAs. When atmosphere was modified by increasing 			the temperature, we achieved 100 percent mortality of the T. 			granarium larvae within 5 minutes and 12 hours at 60 and 54 °C, 			respectively. The other storage pests being admittedly the lesser 			thermo-tolerant may also be controlled under these conditions. Use 			of elevated temperatures is economically feasible, as most of the 			fumigations in Pakistan are carried out during June-Aug immediately 			after harvesting the crop when day time temperature usually touches 			 45 ± 4 °C. With a little effort and energy cost we may raise the 			ware-house temperature to a level of 60 °C to disinfest our stores 			economically. The technology is fit for cereals stored for food 			purpose. In case of seed stores germination test and adjustment of 			the seed rate is recommended before sowing because results have 			revealed significant loss of wheat seed viability. 			Finally, phosphine (PH 3) alone as well as in combination with 60 			percent carbon dioxide was also tested as Methyl bromide (MB) 			alternative at different temperatures as a short term insect control 			strategy. A phosphine concentration of 2 mg-L- 1 gave 100 			percent mortality of five out of seven strains of T. granarium, when 			exposed for a period of 120 hours. Complete control of the other two 			target pests was, however, achieved after 24 hours under the similar 			conditions. Increased temperatures, phosphine concentrations and 			prolonged exposure exerted positive effect on the mortality. It was 			concluded that aforesaid independent variables may be manipulated to 			get complete control of even the resistant pests with low residues 			permissible under Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) and Codex limits. 			Synergistic effect of carbon dioxide also helped in reducing PH 3 			concentrations to ensure phytosanitary management of T. granarium 			for Quarantine and Preshipment (QPS) and other purposes. In nutshell 			the present investigations have revealed that MB alternatives such 			as CAs, MAs as well as PH 3 are very effective in reducing storage 			losses and controlling T. granarium and others storage pests. 			Efficacy of controlled atmospheres can be further improved by 			prestorage treatment of are house with 2...|$|E
