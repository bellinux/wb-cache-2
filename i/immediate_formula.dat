In the general case the computation involves the summation of a convergent infinite series. For the particular case of an infinitely thick central region (corresponding to the two-layer problem), the analysis produces relatively simple closed-form equations for the field components which are suitable for a 'hand calculation'. Specimen calculations for dipoles in seawaters are included and the derived results are compared with computations made using an ac model...|$|R
40|$|Let d(G, k) be {{the number}} of pairs of {{vertices}} of a graph G that are at distance k, λ a real number, and Wλ(G) = k≥ 1 d(G, k) kλ. Wλ(G) is called the Wiener-type invariant of G associated to real number λ. In this paper, the Wiener-type invariants of some graph operations are computed. As <b>immediate</b> consequences, the <b>formulae</b> for reciprocal Wiener index, Harary index, hyper-Wiener index and Tratch-Stankevich-Zefirov index are calculated. Some {{upper and lower bounds}} are also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{formulas}} for the cd-index and the toric h-vector of a convex polytope P from {{a sweeping}} by a hyperplane. These arise from interpreting the corresponding S-shelling of the dual of P. We describe a partition {{of the faces}} of the complete truncation of P to reflect explicitly the nonnegativity of its cd-index and what its components are counting. One corollary is a quick way to compute the toric h-vector directly from the cd-index {{that turns out to be}} an <b>immediate</b> consequence of <b>formulas</b> of Bayer and Ehrenborg. We also propose an “extended toric ” h-vector that fully captures the information in the flag h-vector. ...|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Wurz {{signed a}} deal with WilliamsF1 to become the team's {{official}} test and reserve driver {{at the beginning of}} 2006. He drove the third car at all Grand Prix Fridays in [...] It was announced on 3 August 2006 that Wurz would replace Mark Webber as a race driver at Williams for the [...] season. This was Wurz's first full-time race drive since 2000, and his teammate was Nico Rosberg. At the Monaco GP on 27 May 2007, Wurz scored his first points for the Williams F1 team, finishing in 7th place after qualifying 11th. He came 3rd for the 3rd time in his F1 career at the Canadian Grand Prix on 10 June 2007, staying out of trouble from 19th on the grid in an action packed race. He actually damaged his rear wing early on in the race, but battled against it and finished on the podium. He nearly repeated this at the European Grand Prix, but just didn't make it past Mark Webber at the final chicane. That race turned of to be Wurz's last points finish and especially from now on, teammate Rosberg distanced him. The qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix, where Rosberg started from 16th on the grid, although he lost 10 places due to an engine change in practice, and Wurz started even further back in 18th without being put further back on the grid.On October 8, 2007 Wurz announced his <b>immediate</b> retirement from <b>Formula</b> One, meaning that the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix was his final race.|$|R
