25|$|The {{possibility}} of sterile neutrinos—relatively light neutrinos {{which do not}} participate in the weak interaction but which could be created through flavor oscillation (see below)—is unaffected by these Z-boson-based measurements, and the existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the LSND experiment. However, the currently running MiniBooNE experiment suggested, until recently, that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data, although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos. A recent re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the <b>Institut</b> <b>Laue-Langevin</b> has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.|$|E

Dort wurden Beugungsexperimente an überkritischem Argon unter Verwendung des Isotops Argon- 36, an Fluorwasserstoff unter Verwendung von Deuteriumfluorid und an geschmolzenem Zinkchlorid durchgeführt. Die verwendeten Hochdruckapparaturen werden ausführlich dargestellt. Die Daten der Beugungsexperimente an überkritischem Argon- 36, Deuteriumfluorid, Zinkchlorid, und zusätzlich die Daten früherer Hochdruck-Neutronenbeugungsexperimente an Propan, einer Propan/Methan- sowie Ethan/Methan-Mischung wurden ausgewertet. Im Fall der molekularen Systeme (Propan, Propan/Methan, Ethan/Methan, Deuteriumfluorid) konnten die Molekülstrukturen bestimmt werden. Nach Abtrennung der intramolekularen Anteile konnte die Dichte- bzw. Temperaturabhängigkeit der mikroskopischen Struktur der untersuchten Systeme bestimmt werden. Zusätzlich wurden statistisch-mechanische Rechnungen an Argon und Monte Carlo Simulationen an den drei Kohlenwasserstoff-Systemen durchgeführt. The {{combination}} of high pressure techniques and neutron diffraction {{has been shown}} to be an excellent method for the study of changes of the microscopic structure of liquids over a broad range of densities, since neutrons can penetrate thick-walled sample containers and offer the possibility to separate the partial correlation functions of binary systems or molecular fluids by isotopic substitution techniques. The motivation for the series of neutron diffraction experiments is the lack of experimental data on the structure of liquid and supercritical systems over a broad range of states, which are necessary to test theories of liquids, presented in the last decades. The high pressure diffraction experiments were performed on the D 4 B diffractometer at the high flux reactor of the Institute Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble and at the SANDALS time-of-flight diffractometer at the pulsed neutron source ISIS (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, Didcot, United Kingdom). The scattered intensities of argon- 36, deuterated propane, a deuterated propane + methane mixture, a deuterated ethane + methane mixture, deuterium fluoride and zinc chloride over a broad range of supercritical and liquid thermodynamic states were measured. The distinct terms and the total atom pair correlation functions of all thermodynamic states were determined. According to the knowledge of the author the experiments on zinc chloride were the first high-pressure diffraction experiments on molten salts. A description of the experimental set-up is given. In addition to the neutron diffraction experiments, Monte Carlo simulations on the three alkane systems and statistical mechanical calculations on argon were performed...|$|R

500|$|The most {{dramatic}} deterioration has {{been caused by}} biological factors. It used to be thought that {{the depths of the}} ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mid-1980s has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. During the 1991 IMAX expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around Titanic. A total of 28 species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail fish up to a yard (1 m) long. Much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers. Some of Titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; James Cameron's 2001 expedition discovered a previously unknown type of sea cucumber, lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent [...] "portholes" [...] along its side. A newly discovered species of rust-eating bacterium found on the ship has been named Halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. Henrietta Mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the Titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as 2025. The Canadian geophysicist Steve Blasco has commented that the wreck [...] "has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert." [...] In mid 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the <b>Institut</b> <b>Laue-Langevin</b> demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [...] Halomonas titanicae to survive the osmotic pressure that causes salt water on their membranes. Analysis by Henrietta Mann and Bhavleen Kaur, both of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the University of Seville in Spain, has determined that the wreck of Titanic will not exist by 2037 and that preservation of Titanic is impossible. [...] "Unfortunately, because Titanic is 2.3 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. It is film which will preserve it for history now," [...] says Mann. [...] "It has already lasted for 100 years, but eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain {{on the bottom of the}} Atlantic... I think Titanic has maybe 15 or 20 years left. I don't think it will have too much longer than that." [...] Other scientists have estimated that Titanic will last no longer than 14 years, as of 2017.|$|E
