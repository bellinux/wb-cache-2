[...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old feel, if not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> than the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|E

The dignity of a wise and righteous judge needs not the artificial safeguarding which is a heritage of the old days when if dissent found a tongue the public executioner cut it out. The Bench will be sufficiently respected when it is no longer a place where dullards dream and rogues rob--when its personnel is no longer chosen in the back-rooms of tipple-shops, forced upon yawning conventions and confirmed by the votes of men who neither know what the candidates are nor what they should be.

60|$|In {{my social}} {{experiences}} since Mrs Betty Higden {{came upon the}} scene and left it, I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm {{with me on the}} subject of my view of the Poor Law. Mr friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown 'hands' exactly as they were, and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons. Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance, and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody, anywhere, anyhow. Putting this nonsense aside, I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties; the one, contending that there are no deserving Poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather, to the mercies of some Relieving Officers and some Union Houses; the other, admitting that there are such Poor, but denying that they have any cause or reason <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The records in our newspapers, the late exposure by THE LANCET, and the common sense and senses of common people, furnish too abundant evidence against both defences. But, that my view of the Poor Law may not be mistaken or misrepresented, I will state it. I believe there has been in England, {{since the days of the}} STUARTS, no law so often infamously administered, no law so often openly violated, no law habitually so ill-supervised. In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution, that shock the Public and disgrace the country, the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity--and known language could say no more of their lawlessness.|$|E
