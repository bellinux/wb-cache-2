The latter was computed using a 19 :r 15 grid with a 95 km gridlength hourly, for 1500 - 0300 GMT 10 - 11 April. It was foU 11 d that surface moisture convergence fields were well correlated in space-time with the development of a,urface, sub-synoptic low (SSL) and {{played a key role in}} the initia- tion of the severe convection that took place over the Red River Valley. The most severe convection took place in that region where consistently high surface moisture convergence, high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>instability</b> and high mixing ratio values phased. Finally, some areas where the surface moisture convergence was a poor predictor of severe weather are pOinted out and discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{demonstrated}} that the two-and three-dimensional motility of the human pathogenic parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) depends on sustained instability of the intracellular <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure. This <b>instability</b> drives the cyclic generation and healing of membrane blebs, with typical protrusion velocities of 10 - 20 mu m/second over a few hundred milliseconds and healing times of 10 seconds. The use of a novel micro-electroporation method to control the intracellular pressure enabled us to develop a qualitative model with three parameters: {{the rate of the}} myosin-driven internal pressure increase; the critical disjunction stress of membrane-cytoskeleton bonds; and the turnover time of the F-actin cortex. Although blebs occur randomly in space and irregularly time, they can be forced to occur with a defined periodicity in confined geometries, thus confirming our model. Given the highly efficient bleb-based motility of Eh in vitro and in vivo, Eh cells represent a unique model for studying the physical and biological aspects of amoeboid versus mesenchymal motility in two-and three-dimensional environments...|$|R
40|$|Time-dependent {{downwelling}} on the Oregon {{continental shelf}} is studied with a two-dimensional approximation, that is, spatial variations across shelf and with depth, using the Blumberg-Mellor, finite-difference, stratified, hydrostatic, primitive equation model. The time-dependent response of a coastal ocean at rest to constant, downwelling-favorable wind stress is examined. Topography and stratification {{representative of the}} Oregon continental shelf are used for the basic case experiment. The wind stress forces onshore flow in a turbulent surface boundary layer. The compensating flow below the surface layer advects the density field downward and offshore and accelerates an alongshore current {{in the form of}} a vertically and horizontally sheared coastal jet. The dominant feature of the response flow field is a downwelling front that moves slowly offshore, leaving behind an inshore region where the density is well mixed. The downwelling front in the density field is concentrated near the bottom, while the front in alongshore velocity extends over the full depth and is nearly vertical, separating weak alongshore velocities inshore from the coastal jet offshore. The front contains strong vertical motion from the surface to the bottom and some recirculation. Much of the offshore flow from the base of the front is characterized by time- and space-dependent fluctuations involving spatially periodic separation and reattachment of the bottom boundary layer and accompanying recirculation cells. This flow has positive potential vorticity and appears to be finite-amplitude slantwise convection resulting from a <b>hydrostatic</b> symmetric <b>instability.</b> Additional experiments show the dependence of the response flow field an the magnitude of the wind stress, the initial stratification, and the shelf topography. Experiments with the vertical turbulent kinematic viscosity and diffusivity parameterized by a different turbulence closure scheme, as a function of a local Rich-ardson number, or as constants show dependence of the response flow field on the choice of turbulence submodel. The occurrence of a well-mixed region inshore and the existence of time- and space-dependent fluctuations associated with slantwise convection in the near-bottom offshore flow appear to be robust features of the two-dimensional downwelling response...|$|R
40|$|Reflection of X-rays from cool {{material}} {{around a}} black hole {{is one of the}} few observational diagnostics of the accretion flow geometry. Models of this reflected spectrum generally assume that the accretion disk can be characterized by material in a single ionization state. However, several authors have recently stressed the importance of the classic ionization instability for X-ray irradiated gas in <b>hydrostatic</b> balance. This <b>instability</b> leads to a discontinuous transition in the vertical structure of the disk, resulting in a hot ionized skin above much cooler material. If the Compton temperature of the skin is high then even iron is completely ionized, and the skin does not produce any spectral features. These new models, where the ionization structure of the disk is calculated self-consistently, require an excessive amount of computing power and so are difficult to use in directly fitting observed X-ray spectra. Instead, we invert the problem by simulating X-ray spectra produced by the new reflection models, and then fit these with the old, single zone reflection models, to assess the extent to which the derived accretion geometry depends on the reflection model used. We find that the single zone ionization models can severely underestimate the covering fraction of the ``cold'' material as seen from the X-ray source if the optical depth in the ionized skin is of order unity, and that this can produce an apparent correlation between the covering fraction and the X-ray spectral index similar in nature to that reported by Zdziarski, Lubinski and Smith (1999) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium of a 2 + 1 dimensional perfect fluid star in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space is discussed. The interior geometry matches the exterior 2 + 1 black-hole solution. An upper mass limit is found, analogous to Buchdahl’s theorem in 3 + 1, {{and the possibility}} of collapse is discussed. The case of a uniform matter density is solved exactly and a new interior solution is presented. In 3 + 1 dimensions there is an upper bound on the ratio between the mass and the radius for any general relativistic static fluid sphere: M/R ≤ 4 / 9. Violation of this constraint would imply an infinite central pressure, which signals a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>instability</b> [1]. This result shows that a sufficiently massive star may become unstable and collapse, and the critical mass (Mc) of the star is less than the Schwarzschild limit (the condition for th...|$|E
40|$|Infrared imaging of lobe-cleft instabilities on a river plume front. These data {{accompany}} a paper {{submitted to}} Geophysical Research Letters. The abstract is below. Gravity currents represent a broad class of geophysical flows including turbidity currents, powder avalanches, pyroclastic flows, sea-breeze fronts, haboobs and river plumes. A defining feature in many gravity currents is {{the formation of}} three-dimensional lobes and clefts along the front and {{researchers have sought to}} understand these ubiquitous geophysical structures for decades. The prevailing explanation is based largely on early laboratory and numerical model experiments at much smaller scales, which concluded that lobes and clefts are generated due to <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>instability</b> exclusively in currents propagating over a non-slip boundary. Recent studies suggest that frontal dynamics change as the flow scale increases, but no measurements have been made that sufficiently resolve the flow structure in full-scale geophysical flows. Here, we use thermal infrared and acoustic imaging of a river plume to reveal the three-dimensional structure of lobes and clefts formed in a geophysical gravity current front. The observed lobes and clefts are generated at the front {{in the absence of a}} non-slip boundary, contradicting the prevailing explanation. The observed flow structure is consistent with a alternative formation mechanism, which predicts that the lobe scale is inherited from subsurface vortex structures.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{deficit of}} 8 B solar neutrinos may {{call for an}} improved standard model of the sun or an expanded standard model of particle physics (e. g., with neutrino masses and mixing). In the former case, contemporary fluid motions and thermal fluctuations in the sun’s core may modify nuclear reaction rates and restore agreement. To test this notion, we propose a search for short–term variations of the solar neutrino flux. CERN-TH 6608 / 92, HUTP- 92 /A 038 The observed deficit of 8 B solar neutrinos [1]–[4] may call for an improved standard model of the sun or an expanded standard model of particle physics (e. g., with neutrino masses and mixing). In the former case, contemporary fluid motions and thermal fluctuations in the sun’s core may modify nuclear reaction rates and restore agreement [5] [6]. To test this notion, we propose a search for short–term variations of the solar neutrino flux. Models of the sun fit its radius R and luminosity L to an assumed initial 4 He abundance and a convective mixing length [7]–[10]. While challenged by solar–neutrino observations, they are supported by solar-surface measurements [11] of the frequencies of thousands of p–waves (pressure waves). These are inverted to yield the sound velocity at depth [12] [13]. Whilst the result agrees with solar models to better than 1 %, helioseismology provides scant information about the solar core, where p waves are damped [14]. Solar g waves (for which gravity is the restoring force) are suppressed toward the surface and difficult to see, but they may well be present. As the sun evolves, the 3 He abundance in its core develops a positive outward gradient. This leads [15] [16] to a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>instability</b> (often ignored in standard solar models) and to the secular growth of radially asymmetric standing g waves of low order n (number of radial nodes) and degree l (multipole moment). Their periods (2 π/ω) are of order one hour [14] [17]. Since energy–tranport times are much larger, g waves correspond to quasi–adiabatic temperature fluctuations about a radial mean: T(r, t, θ, φ) = T(r) 1 + A g(r) Ylm(θ, φ) √...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the nonlinear evolution of an unstable baroclinic wave in a regime of rotating stratified flow {{that is of}} relevance to interior circulation in the oceans and in the atmosphere [...] -a regime characterized by small large-scale Rossby and Froude numbers, a small vertical to horizontal aspect ratio, and no bounding horizontal surfaces. Using high-resolution simulations of the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations and companion integrations of the balanced quasi-geostrophic equations, we present evidence for a local route to dissipation of balanced energy directly through interior turbulent cascades. Analysis of simulations presented in {{this study suggest that}} a developing baroclinic instability can lead to secondary instabilities that can cascade {{a small fraction of the}} energy forward to unbalanced scales. Mesoscale shear and strain resulting from the <b>hydrostatic</b> geostrophic baroclinic <b>instability</b> drive frontogenesis. The fronts in turn support ageostrophic secondary circulation and instabilities. These two processes acting together lead to a quick rise in dissipation rate which then reaches a peak and begins to fall slowly when frontogenesis slows down; eventually balanced and imbalanced modes decouple. Dissipation of balanced energy by imbalanced processes scales exponentially with Rossby number of the base flow. We expect that this scaling will hold more generally than for the specific setup we consider given the fundamental nature of the dynamics involved. A break is seen in the total energy spectrum at small scales: While a steep $k^{- 3 }$ geostrophic scaling (where $k$ is the three-dimensional wavenumber) is seen at intermediate scales, the smaller scales display a shallower $k^{- 5 / 3 }$ scaling, reminiscent of the atmospheric spectra of Nastrom & Gage. At higher Ro, the vertical shear spectrum has a minimum, like in some relevant obervation...|$|R
