5|$|Attalus was a {{young child}} when his father died, {{sometime}} before 241BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast. Attalus' mother, Antiochis, {{was related to the}} Seleucid royal family (being a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' father had been Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> when his father died.|$|E

Baker said of Glover's performance, “He turned in a tremendous character, forceful, autocratic but never over the top.” Glover recalled of the role, “I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for it. [...] I think I played it all right. It was very straightforward. Bit of a stereotype. [...] The obligatory asshole!” ...|$|E
500|$|As Pei, {{neared the}} end of his {{secondary}} education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the University of Pennsylvania. Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him. The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of Bing Crosby, which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. [...] "College life in the U.S. {{seemed to me to be}} mostly fun and games", he said in 2000. [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to be serious, I wanted to be part of it... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me." ...|$|E

500|$|It is an R {{song with}} {{elements}} of electro. Lyrically, Carey is recounting a past relationship which fell into [...] "violent times", {{and how she}} still deals {{with the effects of}} what she experienced. Carey begins with the line [...] "I was a girl/ You were ‘the man'/ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to understand/ I was naïve /Believing everything you told me." [...] Although Carey never mentions Mottola's name, many critics believed that she was addressing him directly in the lines [...] "Shining like a chandelier/ That decorated every room inside/ The private hell we built", [...] "Sleeping with the enemy, aware that he was smothering every last part of me" [...] and [...] "Said you were strong/ Protecting me/ Then I found out that you were weak/ Keepin' me there, under your thumb/ Cause you were scared that I'd become much/ More than you could handle." [...] After confessing that she would [...] " [...] up scared some nights, still dreaming about the violent times," [...] Carey decides {{to walk away from the}} relationship, and declares [...] "but I still live with the side effects". J. Freedom De Luc of The Washington Post likened the [...] "echoing" [...] repetition of [...] "Side effects" [...] to that of Rihanna's on her 2007 single [...] "Umbrella". In an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, Carey explained why she felt compelled to write the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Encouraged by her father, Bow {{continued}} to visit studio agencies asking for parts. [...] "But {{there was always}} something. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young,</b> or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat." [...] Eventually, director Elmer Clifton needed a tomboy for his movie Down to the Sea in Ships, saw Bow in Motion Picture Classic magazine, and sent for her. In an attempt to overcome her youthful looks, Bow put her hair up and arrived in a dress she [...] "sneaked" [...] from her mother. Clifton said she was too old, but broke into laughter as the stammering Bow made him believe she was {{the girl in the}} magazine. Clifton decided to bring Bow with him and offered her $35 a week. Bow held out for $50 and Clifton agreed, but he could not say whether she would [...] "fit the part". Bow later learned that one of Brewsters' subeditors had urged Clifton to give her a chance.|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E
2500|$|The sixth track, [...] "I", {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "moody-electro" [...] and a [...] "dark pop" [...] track. It opens with an Eastern-style introduction which merges into a [...] "romantic synth" [...] part, with Roberts singing [...] "I’m scared to wake up one day and find out that my bubble's burst" [...] and hoping that [...] "everyone loves" [...] her new direction, as well as mentioning her dislike for [...] "people that leave comments on the internet". The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush". [...] "Gladiator", the ninth track, {{has been described}} as a Berlin-style dance track. The disco track hears Roberts perform [...] "girly" [...] vocals, with comparisons to Teena Marie and Heartbreak, whilst the following song [...] "Fish Out of Water" [...] garnerered comparisons to Metronomy. Track eleven, [...] "Take a Bite" [...] has been compared to singer Robyn; and features a rap from Roberts including [...] "Called me a rude ginger bitch, they're gonna eat all their words" [...] – referencing a 2003 feud with a member of pop group Busted. The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>young</b> for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here." [...] Lyricism on the album, was based around rap, and rhyme with Roberts stating they were based on personal events, she said: ...|$|E
