5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through <b>independent</b> <b>assortment.</b> In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate <b>independent</b> <b>assortment,</b> the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of <b>independent</b> <b>assortment</b> asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E

Even though the station placed ads in TV Guide in 1979 and 1980 offering assistance to Middle Tennessee viewers who had problems receiving its UHF signal, the problem became mostly a moot one as many households could now view the station clearly via cable.|$|R
40|$|Data are {{reported}} {{on a variety of}} cognitive tasks from 62 college students and 362 nonstudent adults between 20 and 79 years of age. The goals of the project were as follows: (a) to investigate the validity of the practices of using college students and adults over age 65 in studies of cognitive aging, (b) to examine the influence of a variety of background variables on age trends in cognitive performance, and (c) to initiate the development of standard tasks to assist in the description of subject samples in cognitive aging research. The age trends in cognitive performance were relatively <b>independent</b> of an <b>assortment</b> of background variables, but because college students were atypical of their age group in several performance measures they may be suspect as the young-adult control subjects in investiga-tions involving these types of measures. Adults over the age of about 65 appear to exhibit accelerated slowing of speeded performance, but in other respects perform about as one would expect {{on the basis of the}} age trends observed between the ages of 20 and 65. The present studies were designed to investigate three issues considered important in research on cognitive aging. Two of the issues were related to the assessment of presumably normative cross-sectional age trends in cognitive functioning (student sta...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{cells and}} {{aneuploid}} cell lines can acquire resistance against multiple unrelated chemotherapeutic {{drugs that are}} over 3, 000 -fold those of normal levels and display spontaneous resistances up to 20 -fold of normal levels. Two different mechanisms were proposed for this phenotype: (i) classical mutation of drug metabolizing genes or (ii) chromosome reassortments, catalyzed by cancer- and cell line-specific aneuploidy, which generate, via new gene dosage combinations, a plethora of cancer phenotypes, including drug resistance. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we have asked whether three mouse cell lines can become drug resistant, from which two or three genes have been deleted, and on which multidrug resistance is thought to depend: Mdr 1 a, Mdr 1 b, and Mrp 1. Because all three lines could acquire multidrug resistance and were aneuploid, whereas diploid mouse cells could not, we conclude that aneuploid cells become drug resistant via specific chromosome <b>assortments,</b> <b>independent</b> of putative resistance genes. We have asked further whether aneuploid drug-resistant Chinese hamster cells revert spontaneously to drug sensitivity {{in the absence of}} cytotoxic drugs at the high rates that are typical of chromosome reassortments catalyzed by aneuploidy or at the very low or zero rates (i. e., deletion) of gene mutation. We found that four drug-resistant hamster cell lines reverted to drug sensitivity at rates of about 2 – 3 % per generation, whereas two closely related lines remained resistant under our conditions. Thus, the karyotypic instability generated by aneuploidy emerges as the common source of the various levels of drug resistance of cancer cells: minor spontaneous resistances reflect accidental chromosome assortments, the high selected resistances reflect complex specific assortments, and multidrug resistance reflects new combinations of unselected genes located on the same chromosomes as selected genes...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the <b>independent</b> <b>assortment</b> and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E

In 1905, the British geneticists William Bateson, Edith Rebecca Saunders and Reginald Punnett, cross-bred pea plants in experiments similar to Mendel's. They were interested in trait inheritance in the sweet pea and were studying two genes—the gene for flower colour (P, purple, and p, red) and the gene affecting the shape of pollen grains (L, long, and l, round).

5000|$|When two alleles, or {{copies of}} a gene, in an asexual diploid {{organism}} evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by Prof. Bill Birky, but is more {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Meselson Effect". In sexual organisms the processes of recombination and <b>independent</b> <b>assortment</b> allow both of the alleles within an individual to descend from a recent single ancestral allele. Without recombination or <b>independent</b> <b>assortment</b> alleles cannot descend from a recent ancestral allele. Instead the alleles share a last common allelic ancestor at or just preceding the loss of meiotic recombination. A striking example of this effect was described in bdelloid rotifers where the two alleles of the lea gene have diverged into two different genes which work together to preserve the organism during periods of dehydration. The Meselson effect should cause entire {{copies of a}}n organism's genome to diverge from each other, effectively reducing all anciently asexual organisms to a haploid state, in a process similar to the diploidization following whole genome duplication.|$|E

50|$|To {{support his}} theory of pangenes, which was not widely noticed at the time, De Vries {{conducted}} a series of experiments hybridising varieties of multiple plant species in the 1890s.
