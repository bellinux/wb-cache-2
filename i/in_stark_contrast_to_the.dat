5|$|This is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> action {{imposed on}} Indonesia during the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997, {{when it was}} forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a bank run.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stance {{taken by}} his predecessor, Clinton, whose {{approach}} {{and response to}} India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E

50|$|Religions {{which make}} strong absolutist truth claims stand <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> more relativist or universalist positions.|$|R
5|$|The Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, {{decided on}} the day of Belgium's {{surrender}} that the colony would remain loyal to the Allies, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French colonies that later pledged allegiance to the pro-German Vichy government. The Congo was therefore administered from London by the Belgian government in exile during the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
50|$|The shop facade {{is known}} for its {{simplicity}} and austere appearance, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> other premium department stores.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Caravaggio, Judith Beheading Holofernes, c. 1598-1599. In Caravaggio's version the {{beheading}} seems effortless, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Gentileschi's depictions ...|$|R

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E
50|$|The mood {{among the}} Russian {{leaders on the}} eve of the battle stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> that of the French.|$|R
25|$|In the U.S. <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> those {{copyright}} laws which have developed from English law, edicts of government {{are not subject}} to copyright, including edicts of foreign governments.|$|R
5000|$|Gossamer (voiced by Kwesi Boakye) - A {{large red}} furry monster who is Witch Lezah's son. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{previous}} characterizations, Gossamer {{is portrayed as}} timid and kind-hearted.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship {{for the first}} time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
50|$|This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Indian men {{who could}} marry whomever they desired with impunity. In fact, a non-Indian woman that married an Indian man would gain Indian status.|$|R
5000|$|Early on O'Donnell {{was dubbed}} [...] "The Queen of Nice" [...] by Newsweek {{magazine}} for her sweet personality, which was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> many other talk shows of the era.|$|R
50|$|Angie Budgell is {{a stay-at-home}} mom from Minto, New Brunswick. Her high spirits and {{attitude}} are <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her clumsiness. Her perfectionist husband Roy Budgell simply wants things done properly.|$|R
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, the group's {{style was}} moving towards art rock, being {{influenced}} by the bands Blur, Arcade Fire and My Bloody Valentine. The band experimented with different instruments including orchestras, honky-tonk pianos and further so. Mylo Xyloto carries the concept album format from the love and war-induced Viva la Vida. It also expands the spectrum by including electronic & acoustic elements, featuring upbeat tones {{for the first time}} and predominantly being a pop rock album, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's previous works. Lyrical influences were taken from graffiti and the German resistance group White Rose.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
50|$|Cardamon (voiced by Alexander Rodriguez) — Cardamon is a {{young boy}} who is Bee's landlord. He is business-like and mature for his age, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> his {{appearance}} as an elementary schoolboy.|$|R
2500|$|The accident-free {{record of}} United States Navy reactor {{operations}} stands <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{those of the}} Soviet Union, which had fourteen known reactor accidents. As stated in a retrospective analysis in October 2007: ...|$|R
50|$|Bethenny's coldness was {{especially}} evident {{at the end}} of the task, when she left her teammates without saying much in the way of praise, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Dawna's emotional farewell to her team.|$|R
5|$|Well-to-do men {{wore the}} Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and {{decorated}} with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used {{by men and women}} and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces and ear rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Middle Ages, when Latin {{scholars}} focused {{almost entirely}} on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics, Renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying Latin and Greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. Broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a Latin phase, when Renaissance scholars such as Petrarch, Coluccio Salutati (1331–1406), Niccolò de' Niccoli (1364–1437) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of Europe in search of works by such Latin authors as Cicero, Lucretius, Livy and Seneca. By the early 15th century, the bulk of such Latin literature had been recovered; the Greek phase of Renaissance humanism was under way, as Western European scholars turned to recovering ancient Greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.|$|E
5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|E
50|$|However, {{his long}} service stands <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{that of his}} predecessor, Bernard Kerik. Kerik served as an NYPD officer for only 8 years before he was {{appointed}} commissioner by Mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|R

50|$|Morpheus' {{speech is}} usually portrayed as white text in black, wavy-edged speech bubbles bordered in white. The text is {{capitalized}} normally (sentence case) <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> other characters' speech generally in block caps text.|$|R
