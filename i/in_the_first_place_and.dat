Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E

5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} marriage settlement. If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La Marche from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E

25|$|Smaller {{parrotfish}} {{are relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It is better to avoid predator detection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles.

25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought have emerged {{surrounding}} several key questions surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded the way they did, why it began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> what it was. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition {{by a series of}} grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal {{at the beginning of the}} movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.|$|E
25|$|The Cape {{government}} {{on the other hand}} was reluctant to see its local Commandos brought under British imperial command, in what it considered to be essentially a local conflict, not an imperial war of conquest. The Cape had only recently attained local democracy and was extremely suspicious of Imperial infringements upon it. It also considered the slow-moving British troop columns to be absurdly unsuitable for frontier warfare – immobile, ineffective and vastly more expensive than local Cape forces. This last point of contention was chiefly exacerbated by Frere's insistence that the Cape's government pay for his imported British imperial troops, as well as its own local forces. The Cape Government on the other hand wanted to fund and use only its own local forces. It did not desire British troops to operate in the Cape Colony <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> especially objected to being forced to fund them.|$|E
