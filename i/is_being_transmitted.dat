5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>transmitted</b> over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, the {{receiver}} does not detect the return while the signal <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>transmitted.</b> Through {{the use of}} a duplexer, the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 2010, Voyager 2 {{encountered}} {{scientific data}} format problems. On May 17, 2010, JPL engineers {{revealed that a}} flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the issue, and scheduled a bit reset for May 19. On May 23, 2010, Voyager 2 resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit. Currently research is being made into marking the area of memory with the flipped bit off limits or disallowing its use. The Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument is currently operational, and data from this instrument concerning charged particles <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>transmitted</b> to Earth. This data permits measurements of the heliosheath and termination shock. There {{has also been a}} modification to the on-board flight software to delay turning off the AP Branch 2 backup heater for one year. It was scheduled to go off February 2, 2011 (DOY 033, 2011–033).|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>transmitted</b> through the front suspension linkage and half <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>transmitted</b> through the front suspension springs.|$|E
