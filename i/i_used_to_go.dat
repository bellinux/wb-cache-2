I was never drunk but four times in my life. ... <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade." [...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E

500|$|Blade Runner delves {{into the}} effects of {{technology}} {{on the environment and}} society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the [...] "retrofitted" [...] future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as [...] "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel". He also said that he [...] "liked the idea of exploring pain" [...] {{in the wake of his}} brother's death from skin cancer: [...] "When he was ill, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me." ...|$|E

We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's important to understand that you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E
500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down [...] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E
500|$|Roshan then {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) {{in which he}} had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E

500|$|From 1991 to 1994, {{alongside}} The Simpsons, Smith {{was one of}} {{the lead}} cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
2500|$|He wrote briefly for {{publishing}} house Robbins Music and producer Mickie Most in 1967, and then shifted base to the Kennedy Street Enterprises show business management offices in Manchester. He remained there for four years, recalling: [...] "It {{was like an}} office. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in there every morning at 10 o'clock and stay there, working on my songs, until I finished every evening at six o'clock. It was self-discipline and I need that." ...|$|E

Sometimes, along Montauk peninsula, (it is some 15 miles long, and good grazing,) met the strange, unkempt, half-barbarous herdsmen, at that time living there entirely aloof from society or civilization, in charge, on those rich pasturages, of vast droves of horses, kine or sheep, own'd by farmers of the eastern towns. Sometimes, too, the few {{remaining}} Indians, or half-breeds, at that period left on Montauk peninsula, but now I believe altogether extinct.|$|R

2500|$|After {{abandoning the}} dream of {{becoming}} a football goalkeeper, Pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training. Pavarotti's earliest musical influences were his father's recordings, most of them featuring the popular tenors of the day – Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Tito Schipa, and Enrico Caruso. Pavarotti's favourite tenor and idol was Giuseppe Di Stefano and he was also deeply influenced by Mario Lanza, saying: [...] "In my teens <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Mario Lanza movies and then come home and imitate him in the mirror". At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir.|$|E

It sounded so easy, but you'd get to a spot where it was, Jesus, is that a major chord or a minor chord? Now that I'm in the studio with Brian, I know that sometimes he's playing both. He'll do things that sound like they're going to be terribly dissonant, but when it's all put together, It's beautiful. It's actually a great sort of philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E

Her grandmother would influence her greatly through her knowledge of Manx folklore, song and dance. Her childhood was spent in the vicinity of Lezayre, and later Ballaragh near Laxey, where she received a very free and informal upbringing: [...] "I never <b>went</b> <b>to</b> school and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> just <b>go</b> round Ballaragh with the farmers and down <b>to</b> Laxey and <b>went</b> out in the boats with the fishermen, and wandering about pretty well as I liked." ...|$|R

6000|$|Finding that {{we listened}} to her with great attention, Nanny Smith went on with her gossiping. [...] "One time," [...] said she, [...] "Lord Byron took a notion {{that there was a}} deal of money buried about the Abbey by the monks in old times, and nothing would serve him but he must have the {{flagging}} taken up in the cloisters; and they digged and digged, but found nothing but stone coffins full of bones. Then he must needs have one of the coffins put in one end of the great hall, so that the servants were afraid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> there of nights. Several of the skulls were cleaned and put in frames in his room. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the room at night to shut the windows, and if I glanced an eye at them, they all seemed to grin; which I believe skulls always do. I can't say but I was glad {{to get out of the}} room.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{his early}} days, Capote related, [...] "I began writing {{really sort of}} seriously when I was about eleven. I say seriously {{in the sense that}} like other kids go home and {{practice}} the violin or the piano or whatever, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home from school every day, and I would write for about three hours. I was obsessed by it." [...] In 1935, he attended the Trinity School in New York City. He then attended St. Joseph Military Academy. In 1939, the Capote family moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and Truman attended Greenwich High School, where he wrote for both the school's literary journal, The Green Witch, and the school newspaper. When they returned to New York City in 1942, he attended the Franklin School, an Upper West Side private school now known as the Dwight School, and graduated in 1943. That was the end of his formal education.|$|E

The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{his other}} films, Bhansali {{preferred}} shooting at a studio. Bhansali says, [...] "I like to construct sets and then light it up. It {{is a part}} of my story telling. My story needs a setting and I like to create that ambiance." [...] Hence he chose Filmcity, Mumbai to shoot the movie. Before the actual filming started, Hrithik Roshan spent time with a lot of patients to understand his role better and get into the skin of his character. He revealed that he used to [...] ".. spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are.
