However, understanding even a perfect transcript of spoken dietary records (SDRs) is challenging for people. This work presents a first step towards automatic analysis of SDRs. Our approach consists of four steps – <b>identification</b> of food <b>items,</b> <b>identification</b> of food quantifiers, classification of food quantifiers and temporal annotation. Our method enables automatic extraction of dietary information from SDRs, which in turn allows automated mapping to a readily available dietary database. Our model has an accuracy of 90 %.
