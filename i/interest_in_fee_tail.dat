50|$|Lending upon {{security}} of a mortgage on land <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> was risky, since at {{the death of the}} tenant-in-possession, his personal estate ceased to have any right to the estate or to the income it generated. The absolute right to the income generated by the estate passed by operation of law to parties who had no legal obligation to the lender, who therefore could not enforce payment of interest on the new tenants-in-possession. The largest estate a possessor <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> could convey to someone else was an estate for the term of the grantor's own life. If all went as planned, it was therefore impossible for the succession of patriarchs to lose the land, which was the idea.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the passing}} of the statute, an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an estate tail, or an estate <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> (feudum talliatum).

50|$|Legally, advowsons {{were treated}} as real {{property}} that could be held or conveyed, and conversely could be taken or encumbered, in the same general manner as a parcel of land. Advowsons {{were one of the}} earliest incorporeal hereditaments, and often held <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail.</b> Litigation on the basis of an advowson was somewhat specialized, with unique forms of action inapplicable to other realty, such as the writ of quare impedit, by which a patron sued a bishop in support of his presented candidate being unreasonably hindered from succeeding to a benefice.|$|R

But with us fee simple estates are devisable, and Mr. Carvel was wholly within his right in cutting off the line of his eldest son. Do you follow me?" ...|$|R
50|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries the {{practice}} arose whereby when the son {{came of age}} (at 21), {{he and his father}} acting together could bar the existing <b>fee</b> <b>tail,</b> and could then re-settle the land <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail,</b> again on the father for life, then to the son for life and his heirs male successively, {{but at the same time}} making provision for annuities chargeable on the estate for the father's widow, daughters and younger sons, and most importantly, and as an incentive for the son to participate in the re-settlement, an income for the son during his father's lifetime. This process effectively evaded the law against perpetuities, as the entail in law had been terminated, but in practice continued. In this way an estate could stay in a family for many generations, yet emerged on re-settlement often fatally weakened, or much more susceptible to agricultural downturns, from the onerous annuities now chargeable on it.|$|R

5000|$|Taltarum's Case is {{the name}} given to a 15th-century English legal case in the Court of Common Pleas that was {{generally}} thought to have established {{the operation of the}} common recovery. The latter was a collusive legal procedure designed to evade the statute De donis conditionalibus, and was for centuries an important element of English law of real property. The recovery operated to break an entail on freehold or copyhold property held <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> - which could not be freely sold or transferred - leaving it <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple, so that it could be freely sold or a new settlement arranged. Although recoveries had been used before the case to bar entails, the judges' extensive discussion of the principles involved meant that in succeeding centuries the common recovery's procedures, and even the names of some of the fictitious individuals involved in them, were modelled on the case.|$|R
50|$|Entails were {{originally}} designed to keep ownership of land within a family. Thanks {{to the effects of}} the statute De donis conditionalibus, the intent of the entail could not be broken, which meant that land <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> could not simply be sold, transferred, or mortgaged, as whatever the current owner did with it, ownership would automatically pass on their death to those specified by the entail. While entails performed a valuable function in the 13th century, when De donis conditionalibus was enacted, by the 15th century, changes in social and economic conditions meant that landowners were more concerned with being able to freely sell, convey or mortgage their land. It was in this time that the common recovery was devised as a way of circumventing De donis conditionalibus.|$|R
50|$|Berenguer Ramon as a {{historical}} figure is enigmatic, shrouded in incomprehensible contradictions and ambiguities. First, {{he was a man}} of peace, and peace ruled throughout his reign. He pacified his neighbours as well, bringing to heel the Count of Urgell, Ermengol II. He reestablished amicable relations with Hugh I, Count of Empúries, and maintained them with William I of Besalú and Wilfred II of Cerdanya. He was a son of the church who maintained relations with the papacy and went on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1032. On many occasions he travelled to Zaragoza and Navarre to discuss with Sancho III the Great, King of Navarre their mutual stance against the Counts of Toulouse. His confidantes and councillors were the Abbot Oliva, the judge Ponç Bofill, Gombau de Besora, and the Bishops Pedro of Girona and Deudado of Barcelona. In 1025, he decreed that the proprietors of entails (men holding land <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail)</b> were free from taxation.|$|R
50|$|Andrew's father, Vincent Corbet, had {{inherited}} vast estates when his brother Richard died in 1606: 12,600 acres in Shropshire, concentrated mainly between the county town and Market Drayton, on the north-western edge, {{as well as}} 7,000 acres in Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire. However, there were major problems. Richard's debts were huge, and he left the new Elizabethan building at Moreton Corbet Castle, begun by Robert, still unfinished after a quarter century or more in construction. Although most of the estates were <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> male, preventing their dispersal, substantial lands were not. This meant that Robert Corbet's surviving daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Sir Henry Wallop could mount claims to them, {{and in some cases}} had already taken possession. Most pressing of all, Richard's widow, Judith Austin, a forceful woman, thrice-married and very wealthy, held large estates as her jointure. Worse still, Judith had potential claims on more, as the improvident Richard had made up her jointure in questionable ways, acknowledging as much in his rambling will.|$|R
50|$|The Bombay Presidency {{was created}} {{when the city}} of Bombay was leased <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> to the East India Company by a Royal Charter from the King of England, Charles II, who had in turn {{acquired}} it on May 11, 1661, when his marriage treaty with Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands of Bombay in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles. The English East India Company transferred its Western India headquarters from Surat, its first colony in that region, to Bombay in 1687. The Presidency was brought under British Parliament control along with other parts of British India through Pitt's India Act. Major territorial acquisitions were made during the Anglo-Maratha Wars when {{the whole of the}} Peshwa's dominions and much of the Gaekwad's sphere of influence were annexed to the Bombay Presidency in different stages till 1818. Aden was annexed in 1839, while Sind was annexed by the Company in 1843 after defeating the Talpur dynasty in the Battle of Hyderabad and it was made a part of the Bombay Presidency.|$|R
50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a {{freehold}} {{estate of inheritance}} which is limited or qualified by the existence of certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a tenant in tail, not in possession, who bars the entail without the consent of the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future tenants in tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue <b>in</b> <b>tail.</b> The base <b>fee</b> can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated <b>in</b> the <b>fee</b> <b>tail</b> ran out.|$|R

5000|$|More recent {{research}} has shown that the background of Taltarum's Case was as follows. A man called Thomas Trevistarn granted land in Portreath to one William Smyth <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail.</b> On William Smyth's death, his eldest son and heir Humphrey took possession of the land under the entail. Humphrey Smyth then conveyed part of the land to a man called John Tregoz, probably as part of a marriage settlement, and Tregoz accordingly reconveyed it back entailed on Humphrey and his wife Jane, with remainder to Humphrey's heirs. Humphrey's wife died childless, and he suffered a recovery of the land to another man, Thomas Talcarn (the person whose name was afterwards misspelt [...] "Taltarum"). At this point, Humphrey probably believed that the recovery, in accordance with usual practice, would bar both existing entails. Talcarn, in turn, conveyed it to Henry Hunt - probably without even taking possession. However, on Humphrey Smyth's death, John Smyth, the son and heir of Humphrey's younger brother Robert, claimed possession of the land under the original entail, evicting Hunt. The case itself was concerned with Hunt's action on forcible entry against John Smyth. Hunt {{would be able to get}} a favourable judgment if he, and his lawyer John Catesby, could demonstrate that the recovery to Talcarn had destroyed the operation of the entail originally created by Trevistarn.|$|R

60|$|I shall {{begin with}} those which {{relate to the}} {{possession}} and inheritance of landed property in Popish hands. The first operation of those acts upon this object was wholly to {{change the course of}} descent by the Common Law, to take away the right of primogeniture, and, in lieu thereof, to substitute and establish a new species of Statute Gavelkind. By this law, on the death of a Papist possessed of an estate <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> simple or <b>in</b> <b>fee</b> <b>tail,</b> the land is to be divided by equal portions between all the male children; and those portions are likewise to be parcelled out, share and share alike, amongst the descendants of each son, and so to proceed in a similar distribution ad infinitum. From this regulation it was proposed that some important consequences should follow. First, by taking away the right of primogeniture, perhaps in the very first generation, certainly in the second, the families of Papists, however respectable, and their fortunes, however considerable, would be wholly dissipated, and reduced to obscurity and indigence, without any possibility that they should repair them by their industry or abilities,--being, as we shall see anon, disabled from every species of permanent acquisition. Secondly, by this law the right of testamentation is taken away, which the inferior tenures had always enjoyed, and all tenures from the 27th Hen. VIII; Thirdly, the right of settlement was taken away, that no such persons should, from the moment the act passed, be enabled to advance themselves in fortune or connection by marriage, being disabled from making any disposition, in consideration of such marriage, but what the law had previously regulated: the reputable establishment of the eldest son, as representative of the family, or to settle a jointure, being commonly the great object in such settlements, which was the very power which the law had absolutely taken away.|$|R
