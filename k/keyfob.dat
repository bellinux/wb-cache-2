25|$|During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the <b>keyfob</b> {{was still}} {{available}} upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs {{will continue to}} work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.|$|E

50|$|The {{owner of}} the <b>keyfob</b> found by Alice Postic is first thought to be Maximan's friend Jacques Noiret then the missing Julien Nalestro. The {{initials}} of both are JN, but on the <b>keyfob</b> the wrong initials are inscribed - GN.|$|E
50|$|The {{electronics}} industry now uses many {{surface mounted}} lithium battery holders or sockets. CR2/3A, CR1/2AA and CR123A batteries began in camera applications, but expanded into new markets like alarm systems, hand held computers, and <b>keyfobs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Location-Based Services DASH7 {{is being}} used today for {{developing}} new location-based services using a range of DASH7-enabled devices including smartcards, <b>keyfobs,</b> tickets, watches and other conventional products that {{can take advantage of}} the unique small footprint, low power, long range, and low cost of DASH7 relative to less practical and high-power wireless technologies like WiFi or Bluetooth. Using DASH7, users can [...] "check in" [...] to venues in ways not practical with current check-in technologies like GPS, that are power-intensive and fail indoors and in urban environments. Location-based services like Foursquare, Novitaz, or Facebook can exploit this capability in DASH7 and award loyalty points, allow users to view the Facebook or Twitter addresses of those walking past, and more.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, Matalan trialed {{a reward}} scheme using {{points on the}} Matalan card in Scottish stores. At the same time, a <b>keyfob</b> was {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} the card, similar to Tesco Clubcard. However Matalan did not roll out this scheme to the rest of the stores, and concentrated on offering more to the customer in store.|$|E
50|$|The Akbil {{device was}} touched {{to the reader}} at the faregate to gain access for {{boarding}} or on the vehicle to ride. The system used iButtons or smart radio-frequency identification cards as tickets. Akbils were 1-Wire (iButton) electronic tags. The <b>keyfob</b> version of the device had the emblem of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality moulded on it.|$|E
50|$|It {{comprises}} 240 en-suite rooms, {{organized into}} flats of between 4 and 8 students all sharing kitchen facilities. There are no living rooms as {{in some of}} the other student halls. It has a secure parking area beneath the bases of the Towers which is accessed only by <b>keyfob</b> with a capacity of around 20 cars. This is adequate as most exchange students do not have cars.|$|E
50|$|Recently, it {{has become}} {{possible}} to take the electronic components associated with regular <b>keyfob</b> OTP tokens and embed them in a credit card form factor. However, the thinness of the cards, at 0.79mm to 0.84mm thick, prevents standard components or batteries from being used. Special polymer-based batteries must be used which have a much lower battery life than coin (button) cells. Semiconductor components must not only be very flat but must minimise power used in standby and when operating.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in late 2010, Tesco {{launched}} {{applications for}} iPhone, BlackBerry, Android (operating system) and Nokia Ovi, so points can be collected by presenting a barcode on the handset {{instead of a}} <b>keyfob</b> or card. This application was relatively simple on launch, offering {{little more than a}} barcode, however updates have increased functionality to include features such as the ability to view current offers instore. On 10 July 2017, Tesco released the Clubcard application on the Google Play store.|$|E
5000|$|Z-Wave is a {{wireless}} communications protocol used primarily for home automation. It is {{a mesh network}} using low-energy radio waves to communicate from appliance to appliance, allowing for wireless control of residential appliances and other devices, such as lighting control, security systems, thermostats, windows, locks, swimming pools and garage door openers. Like other protocols and systems aimed at the home and office automation market, a Z-Wave automation system can be controlled via the Internet from {{a wireless}} <b>keyfob,</b> a wall-mounted keypad or through smartphones, tablets or computers, with a Z-Wave gateway or central control device serving as both the hub controller and portal to the outside. [...] It provides interoperability between home control systems of different manufacturers that {{are a part of}} its alliance. As of May 2017, there are over 1,700 interoperable Z-Wave products.|$|E
5000|$|The European Kangaroo is a {{competition}} which follows the same structure as the AMC (Australian Mathematics Competition). There are twenty-five multiple questions and no penalty marking. This paper is taken throughout Europe by over 3 million pupils {{from more than}} 37 countries. Two different Kangaroo papers follow on from the Intermediate Maths Challenge and the next 5500 highest scorers below the Olympiad threshold are invited to take part (both papers are by invitation only). The Grey Kangaroo is sat by students in year 9 and below and the Pink Kangaroo is sat by those in years 10 and 11. The top 25% of scorers in each paper receive a certificate of merit and the rest receive a certificate of participation. All those who sit either Kangaroo also receive a <b>keyfob</b> containing a different mathematical puzzle each year. (The puzzles along with solutions) ...|$|E
40|$|Cloud-based {{services}} are now {{an integral part}} of everyday lives of many users. Indeed, users who do not use Facebook, Gmail, Dropbox, GoogleDrive, QQ, Baidu or similar {{services are}} now a rarity. These services offer seamless integration of user data with multiple user-owned devices, reliable online backup, and enable easy and instant communications between users. Such features, at an affordable price of zero dollars, make these services very popular, even though they are an antithesis to user privacy, and help create large-scale surveillance programs such as NSA PRISM. Several mechanisms have been proposed and implemented to make these services privacy-friendly. Most past proposals rely on public key systems with user-managed private keys, or password-based symmetric encryption. We explore a symmetric-key approach without password-derived keys to facilitate end-to-end encryption of stored user data (e. g., cloud storage) and communication messages (e. g., web-based email). We propose <b>Keyfob,</b> a key management scheme for easy key transfer between user-owned devices, and between users. <b>Keyfob</b> uses high-entropy random keys for encryption instead of password-derived keys, and leverages DH-EKE (Bellovin and Merritt, IEEE S&P 1992) with weak secrets for secure key transfer. Each user needs to manage one user-master key, and all other keys are derived from that master key or a pair-wise shared master key. We implemented <b>Keyfob</b> as a Firefox extension using the Firefox Sync service, which implements an EKE variant. <b>Keyfob</b> can make several applications and services privacy-friendly, if appropriate intermediate layers are implemented, e. g., as plugins between a target cloud-service application and the <b>Keyfob</b> extension. We have implemented two such plugins to support encrypted Dropbox (in desktop and Android) and Gmail (in desktop). Our hope in proposing <b>Keyfob</b> with a symmetric-key approach is to highlight challenges in such a lesser-explored mechanism, and attract researchers towards the long-standing problem of enabling end-to-end encryption in a cloud-dominated environment...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{all modern}} cars can be {{controlled}} remotely using a personal communicator (<b>keyfob).</b> However, the degree of interaction between currently available personal communicators and cars is very limited. The communication link is unidirectional and the communication range {{is limited to a}} few dozen meters. However, there are many interesting applications that could be supported if a <b>keyfob</b> would be able to support energy efficient bidirectional longer range communication. In this paper we investigate off-the-shelf transceivers in terms of their usability for bidirectional longer range communication. Our evaluation results show that existing transceivers can generally support the required communication ranges but that links tend to be very unreliable. This high unreliability must be handled in an energy efficient way by the <b>keyfob</b> to car communication protocol in order to make off-the-shelf transceivers a viable solution...|$|E
40|$|Here's {{the remote}} {{controlled}} garden lighting unit which I built for my house. It needed to control several lighting channels via a remote <b>keyfob,</b> and preferably include a timer to switch {{the lights on}} automatically in the evening etc. I decided to build a controller rather than buy one because 1) it was much cheaper, 2) it was fun and 3) it enabled me to include the timer facility, which wasn't available on any commercial units at reasonable cost. The radio link uses 433 MHz AM mode. I did not design the radio link but used commercially available transmitter (<b>keyfob)</b> and receiver modules. The receive antenna is 17 cm of stiff wire. Transmit power is 10 mW and the range {{is said to be}} 100 m in open air. In practice I have found that I can operate the lights from any part of my house and garden, which is enough for me, and much better than can be said for my remote garage door opener <b>keyfob.</b> The receiver module has three logic level outputs, with which I drive three relays via a transistor buffer. A completely standard and straightforward circuit. The power supply produce...|$|E
