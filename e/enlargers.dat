25|$|At {{this time}} to {{differentiate}} between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens, MINOX introduced an edge code in the negative. Since the MINOX C (the first camera released with the new minox lens) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera. The reason was that commercial processors used MINOX <b>enlargers.</b> As the minox lens replaced the complan, so the <b>enlargers</b> had to change lenses: MINOX II <b>enlargers</b> were curved negative track and complan lenses, MINOX III <b>enlargers</b> were straight negative track and minox lenses. Ironically, owners of Rigas and model II cameras would get better results from a MINOX III enlarger than a MINOX II enlarger.|$|E

50|$|A {{diffuser}} <b>enlarger's</b> {{light source}} is diffused by translucent glass or plastic, providing even illumination for the film.|$|R
50|$|Filters in the <b>enlarger's</b> {{light path}} {{are a common}} method of {{achieving}} this control. Magenta filters absorb green and transmit blue and red, while yellow filters absorb blue and transmit green and red.|$|R
50|$|The <b>enlarger's</b> lamp or shutter {{mechanism}} is controlled either by an electronic timer, {{or by the}} operator - who marks time with a clock, metronome or simply by counting seconds - shuttering or turning off the lamp when the exposure is complete. The exposed paper can be processed immediately or placed in a light-tight container for later processing.|$|R
60|$|It is not {{pleasant}} {{in general}} {{to dispel the}} illusions of romance, though Dante's will bear the operation with less hurt to a reader's feelings than most; and I suspect, that if {{nine out of ten}} of all the implied conclusions of other narratives in his poem could be compared with the facts, he would be found {{to be one of the}} greatest of romancers in a new and not very desirable sense, however excusable he may have been in his party-prejudice. But a romance may be displaced, only to substitute perhaps matters of fact more really touching, by reason of their greater probability. The following is the whole of what modern inquirers have ascertained respecting Paulo and Francesca. Future <b>enlargers</b> on the story may suppress what they please, as Dante did; but if any one of them, like the writer of the present remarks, is anxious to speak nothing but the truth, I advise him (especially if he is for troubling himself with making changes in his story) not to think that he has seen all the authorities on the subject, or even remembered all he has seen, until he has searched every corner of his library and his memory. All the poems hitherto written upon this popular subject are indeed only to be regarded as so many probable pieces of fancy, that of Dante himself included.|$|E
50|$|Durst ended {{production}} of their <b>enlargers,</b> {{well known for}} their quality, in late 2006, due to a drop in sales, probably due to growth of minilabs and later digital imaging.In the 70 years of manufacturing <b>enlargers</b> their sales peaked in 1979 with 107,000 sold.Durst have filed over 500 patents for various components and designs of <b>enlargers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prints {{made with}} an {{enlarger}} are called enlargements. Typically, <b>enlargers</b> {{are used in}} a darkroom, an enclosed space from which extraneous light may be excluded; some commercial <b>enlargers</b> have an integral dark box {{so that they can}} be used in a light-filled room.|$|E
40|$|Time {{optimal control}} {{problems}} for systems with impulsive controls are investigated. Sufficient {{conditions for the}} existence of time optimal controls are given. A dynamical programming principle is derived and Lipschitz continuity of an appropriately defined value functional is estab-lished. The value functional satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the viscosity sense. A numerical example for a rider-swing system is presented and it is shown that the reachable set is <b>enlargered</b> by allowing for impulsive controls, when compared to nonimpulsive controls...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} practice of education and life in Bunkagakuin before the Second world War. The education practised in Bunkagakuin was obviously different from Meiji national education. The education and life were organized upon a principle of domesticity education according to {{the thought of the}} establisher Nisimura Isaku who emphasised that the education of children is the most important duty of parents and the education like a domesticity education is the best. The respect for the freedom and the personality of children was stressed as another important principle. The radical liberal education was attempted in Bunkagakuin. And at the same time, it was also attempted to spread a new life style of middle class. The education and life in Bunkagakuin reflected the new consciousness of education of middle class which was born and <b>enlargered</b> from 1910 s to 1920 s. And we can say the radical liberal education in Bunkagakuin was one of types of Taisyou new education...|$|R

50|$|Sun Ray Photo Company made photographers' {{equipment}} including camera tripods {{and four}} photo <b>enlargers.</b> The tripods were multi-sectional, fabricated in chrome-plated steel tubing and brass friction fittings. The photo <b>enlargers,</b> {{three of which}} employed a double condenser, are the Arnold D, Mastercraft 23, and Mastercraft 43 models. The exception is the Aristocrat A, Sun Ray's initial entry, which {{is equipped with a}} diffusion head. The Aristocrat A is focused by means of a focusing tube. The other Sun Ray <b>enlargers</b> are focused through a bellows (photography). None of Sun Ray's <b>enlargers</b> are equipped with autofocus. All use a single post column. Aside from the corporation's final enlarger, the Mastercraft 43, each has a 2.25 × 3.25-inch format. Mastercraft 43 has a 4 × 5-inch format. The Arnold D enlarger model features a faster standard lens than any of the others.|$|E

50|$|Dedicated color <b>enlargers</b> {{typically}} {{contain an}} adjustable filter mechanism - the color head - between the light source and the negative, enabling {{the user to}} adjust the amount of red, green and blue light reaching the negative to control color balance. Other models have a drawer where cut filters can be inserted into the light path, synthesize colour by additive mixing of light from colored lamps with adjustable intensity or duty cycle, or expose the receiving medium sequentially using red, green and blue light. These <b>enlargers</b> {{can also be used}} with variable-contrast monochrome papers.|$|E
50|$|Omega is {{the name}} of various medium-format cameras and <b>enlargers.</b> The Simmon Brothers, known for their line of <b>enlargers,</b> built the {{original}} Simmon Omega cameras in the United States. These rangefinder cameras took 6x7cm photographs on 120 roll film. Later, Konica manufactured the Koni Omega line. The last models, including the Rapid Omega 200, came from Mamiya. This line had interchangeable lenses, including a 58 (or 60) mm wide-angle, a 90 mm normal lens, a 135 mm portrait lens, and a 180 mm telephoto. A close-up adapter was popular with wedding photographers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{image from}} the {{negative}} or transparency is projected through a lens fitted with an adjustable iris aperture, onto to a flat surface bearing the sensitized photographic paper. By adjusting the ratio of distance from film to lens to the distance from lens to paper, various degrees of enlargement may be obtained, with the physical enlargement ratio limited only by {{the structure of the}} enlarger {{and the size of the}} paper. As the image size is changed it is also necessary to change the focus of the lens. Some <b>enlargers,</b> such as Leica's [...] "Autofocus" [...] <b>enlargers,</b> perform this automatically.|$|E

It very soon dropped the production of cameras, and it became Fujimoto Photo Industries Co Ltd (Fujimoto Shashin Kōgyō Kabushiki Kaisha, 藤本写真工業株式会社) in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Jerry Uelsmann is {{best known}} for using digital tools in the {{darkroom}} before Photoshop was available. He started off with photography in high school as a hobby and then decided to go to an institution to learn photography. Uelsmann's photographs are different from those of most photographers because he uses multiple negatives to produce one picture. He started with one enlarger but after waiting for some prints to dry one day, he decided to use more <b>enlargers</b> to get more images quickly, then began using seven <b>enlargers</b> at one time. His darkroom style allowed him to create images that had realism and the motion of what would be seen in dreams.|$|E
