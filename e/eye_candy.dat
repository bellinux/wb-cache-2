5|$|In January 2007, Hall began a scripted {{rivalry with}} Massaro {{centered}} on Hall's jealousy of Massaro's recent Playboy appearance; the rivalry turned Hall into a villain and matches {{between the two}} mainly resulted in losses for Hall. During the feud, Hall attempted to prove that she was talented in areas beyond wrestling and being <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> by creating a new in-ring persona, in which she sang badly at every opportunity, but {{thought she was a}} very good singer. She later attempted to impress music producer Timbaland by performing a song she claimed to have composed herself, looking for a spot in a video he was preparing and a possible future collaboration on a music project, but he turned her down. Massaro, with whom she had been involved in a rivalry, was one of the wrestlers who was chosen to work with Timbaland instead. Jealous of Massaro's recent successes, she attacked her and, in storyline, seriously injured her, with the reasoning that if she could not appear in Timbaland's music project, neither could Massaro.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{three-dimensional}} graphics {{has become}} increasingly common in mainstream operating systems, from creating attractive interfaces, termed <b>eye</b> <b>candy,</b> to functional purposes only possible using three dimensions. For example, user switching is represented by rotating a cube which faces are each user's workspace, and window management is represented via a Rolodex-style flipping mechanism in Windows Vista (see Windows Flip 3D). In both cases, the operating system transforms windows on-the-fly while continuing to update the content of those windows.|$|E
25|$|Recently the {{widespread}} diffusion of advanced graphics hardware has improved the rendering {{capabilities of the}} visualization tools. The capabilities of current shading languages allow the inclusion of advanced graphic effects (like ambient occlusion, cast shadows and non-photorealistic rendering techniques) in the interactive visualization of molecules. These graphic effects, beside being <b>eye</b> <b>candy,</b> can improve the comprehension of the three-dimensional shapes of the molecules. An example of the effects {{that can be achieved}} exploiting recent graphics hardware {{can be seen in the}} simple open source visualization system QuteMol.|$|E

5|$|In early 2004, McDougal {{appeared}} in a photo spread in the Italian edition of Vogue with fellow Playmates, Pamela Anderson, Audra Lynn and Tishara Cousino. It was a tennis themed men's fashion spread shot in Las Vegas by photographer David LaChapelle. The spread contained her first published nudes since her contract with Playboy expired years earlier. She traveled to Japan {{to be one of}} the <b>eye</b> <b>candies</b> for Scott Hall and Kevin Nash (The Outsiders) when they wrestled at Yokohama, Japan in May 2004. McDougal also participated in the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Playboy throughout the year at Las Vegas, New York and Moscow with other Playmates past and present.|$|R
5000|$|Admittedly, {{much of the}} {{criticism}} is justified. Many scenes are somewhat sexist, portraying women as merely <b>eye</b> <b>candies.</b> Some criticized it for looking like a succession of television commercials with cheap nude scenes. [...] Yet, despite the tide of complaints against the storyline, the confusion dealt to most viewers, and the subsequent reluctance of moviegoers to embrace the movie, there has been one consistent point -- the on point acting of all cast members. Kims acting prowess, star power, and ability to spark discussion has been fully realized by Real. A lot of research and preparation went into the characters he portrays. The effort was deserving of a second viewing to fully understand the various intricacies of the plotline. [...] Support from veteran actors Lee Sung Min (Broken), Sung Dong-il (Miss Granny), Lee Kyoung-young (Inside Men) and relative newcomer Sulli are all well worth a mention.|$|R
25|$|There is no set rule on {{what kind}} of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play.

However, {{it has been argued that}} M's pivotal role in the plot of Skyfall qualifies her as a Bond girl or Bond woman.|$|E
25|$|Sable's eclipsed {{popularity}} and her feud with Marc Mero {{and his new}} manager, Jacqueline lead to the reinstatement of the Women's Championship {{as well as the}} promotion's hiring of more female wrestlers. Sable's popularity led to a shift in {{the role of women in}} the WWF, as the promotion began to rely less on its female performers as simply <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> and placed a greater emphasis on female athletes who actually competed in matches including re-establishing a women's division. She was one of the first females to compete in such specialty matches as evening gown matches, inter-gender tag team matches, and strap matches, competed in the first-ever WWF bikini contest against Jacqueline, and was also the first female talent to be a Playboy cover girl. Unlike Jacqueline, Ivory, Tori, and Luna Vachon, the more physical and experienced wrestlers at the time, Sable later admitted that it was written in her contract that she was not allowed to take bumps.|$|E

In particular, she noted the beauty of the light reflections, rain scenes, and camera angles.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Sévérine's death sequence was primarily negative. Dunt criticized Bond's comment following Sévérine's death - [...] "Waste of good Whiskey" [...] - as [...] "brutish and uncaring". Jade Budowski of The Tribeca Film Institute described {{the scene as}} [...] "unpalatable", and wrote that she [...] "sense it in the shifting of some of my neighbors in the theater," [...] specifically after the delivery of Bond's line. She argued that the sequence returned to the franchise's earlier treatment of women as [...] "expendable figures" [...] viewing them only as [...] "sex objects, <b>eye</b> <b>candy,</b> and plot devices". Berlatsky argued that Bond's reaction was just a [...] "callous joke" [...] and Sévérine existed {{for the sole purpose}} of [...] "lend weight to Craig's perspicuity, sexiness, and imperviousness". Paste's Kenneth Lowe found Bond's behavior toward women to be negative, citing Sévérine's death as a prominent example.|$|E

5000|$|Evancho was the {{youngest}} solo artist ever to headline a special on the Great Performances series. [...] The concert was taped in April 2011 at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, and was co-hosted by David Foster, who played the piano in the orchestra {{for many of the}} selections, while Conrad Tao played piano and violin in some selections. [...] The performances are available as a CD/DVD titled Dream With Me In Concert. Allmusic noted: [...] "the concert version ... sounds nearly identical (outside of the waves of applause) to the studio album ... but the accompanying DVD, which features the heavily choreographed performance, as well as an extensive photo gallery and interviews with both Evancho and Foster, should provide enough <b>eye</b> and ear <b>candy</b> to appease fans of the gifted young vocalist until a proper follow-up appears.|$|R

[...] However, Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave [...] "Bound" [...] a score of one out of four, saying that it was [...] "too dumb, too obvious, too boring, and too rooted in gender stereotypes". He said that it was sexist and [...] "the worst episode of Enterprise in more than two years". Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation said that it was the single worst episode of any Star Trek series, including [...] "Spock's Brain". She considered it a statement in misogyny and also thought that it represented a scenario where homosexual characters do not exist.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} with the Harajuku Lovers Tour. Patrick MacDonald of the Seattle Times, while applauding Stefani's song-writing efforts and the show's [...] "frothy fun" [...] antics, reprimanded the singer's dancing and limited material, given that she {{performed}} only twelve songs from Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and two from The Sweet Escape but none from previous {{work with her}} band No Doubt. In regards to the musical selection, MacDonald concluded that half the songs are [...] "eminently forgettable", a view echoed by Winnipeg Sun columnist Rob Williams, who described some of the album tracks as [...] "filler". Despite these objections, Williams issued her MTS Center performance a three-and-a-half out of five stars. [...] "But sometimes the music didn't matter when there was as much <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> as Stefani provided", opined the Winnipeg Sun writer. [...] "She is an extremely striking figure and the choreography, light show, backup dancers and frequent costume changes all added to the spectacle, which ended up being more style than substance." ...|$|E

[...] Alan Fletcher (who plays Karl Kennedy) said that McGregor is [...] "fantastic" [...] as Mark and he added [...] "He's not only spectacularly handsome, he's also a very fine actor."

40|$|As {{the title}} suggests, the feminist {{reception}} of Lara Croft {{as a game}} character has been ambivalent to say the least. The question itself presupposes an either/or answer, thereby neatly expressing the polarities around which most popular media and academic discussions of Lara Croft tend to revolve. It {{is a question that}} is often reduced to trying to decide whether she is a positive role model for young girls or just that perfect combination of <b>eye</b> and thumb <b>candy</b> for the boys. It is also increasingly difficult to distinguish between Lara Croft the character in Tomb Raider and Lara Croft the ubiquitous virtual commodity used to sell products as diverse as the hardware to play the game itself, Lucozade or Seat cars. What follows then is an analysis of the efficacy and limitations of existing feminist frameworks through which an understanding of the kinds of gendered pleasures offered by Lara Croft as games character and cultural icon can be reached. I will begin by analyzing Lara primarily as an object of representation – a visual spectacle – and then move on, considering {{the ways in which the}} act of playing Tomb Raider as Lara disrupts the relationship between spectator and "spectac...|$|R

500|$|Several critics {{regard the}} 1991 {{animated}} film as {{superior to the}} 2017 live-action remake. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 1991 film [...] "worked wonderfully because it was pure Broadway, written for the screen, blending comedy and romance and magic and just enough snark in the margins", while the 2017 remake got lost in translation since [...] "The movie takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted. It zips from one number to another, throwing a ton of frenetically edited <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> at the screen, charmlessly." [...] Phillips also wrote of the 2017 film that [...] "too often we're watching highly qualified performers, plus a few less conspicuously talented ones (Watson, primarily), stuck doing karaoke, or motion-capture work of middling quality". Dana Schwartz of the Observer criticized some of the 2017 film changes to the characters like Gaston and the Beast as regressive by watering down their distinguishing personalities from the 1991 film, also arguing that the added backstory to {{the characters in the}} 2017 version failed to [...] "advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way". David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film [...] "feels particularly egregious, in part, because it’s so slavishly devoted to the original; every time it falls short of its predecessor (which is quite often), it’s hard not to notice".|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received.

Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as [...] "clean and crisp" [...] and added that the cutscenes were [...] "beautifully polished". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that [...] "Crash Nitro Kart maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look {{that has been the}} hallmark of past Crash Bandicoot games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were [...] "bright and cheery and smooth", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you {{have a pretty good idea}} what this one looks like."

In 2011, Nintendo Power listed Samus as their third-favourite hero, citing her bravery in the face of dangerous situations, while UGO.com also included her on the list of video game characters who need their own movies. That same year, Empire ranked her as the 26th-greatest video game character, adding, [...] "whether you see her as a breakthrough for feminism or just another faceless sci-fi warrior, 1986's unexpected reveal that showed women could be more in gaming lore than <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> for geeky boys was a refreshing and unforgettable moment."

AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people will take to them like a fish to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E

Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office <b>eye</b> <b>candy.</b> She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right now who doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value."

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I wanted {{to sit in the}} front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of <b>eye</b> <b>candy</b> that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures.

Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching."

500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics. Speaking of the premiere, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV {{noted that the}} special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom {{and one of the}} surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." [...] In contrast, Kelly West of TV Blend was critical of the premiere, writing: [...] "I don’t think based on the first episode that we can say that Grey's is headed in a new direction, nor do I think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be <b>eye</b> <b>candy,</b> but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
