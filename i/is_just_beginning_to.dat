The day before the princess is due to be sacrificed, Assipattle, the youngest son of a local farmer and despised by his family, mounts his father's horse and at dawn arrives on the beach where the creature <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> awaken. After stealing some hot peat and acquiring a small boat, Assipattle is driven by the waves into the stoor worm's mouth as it starts yawning. The boat is carried down to the depths of the creature's stomach until it finally comes to rest. Assipattle plunges the still burning peat into the stoor worm's liver, causing a [...] "fire that blazed like a furnace". The pain of its burning liver causes the creature to have a fit of retching that carries Assipattle, who has managed to return to his boat, back out of the monster's mouth.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{developers}} {{sought to}} make the game's environment more [...] "fantasy-oriented" [...] than its PlayStation predecessors. Since the creators wanted to prevent the series from following a redundant setting, Final Fantasy IX distinctly breaks from the futuristic styles of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII by reintroducing a medieval setting. In the game, steam technology <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> become widely available; the population relies on hydropower or wind power for energy sources, but sometimes harness Mist or steam to power more advanced engines. Continuing with the medieval theme, the game's setting is inspired by Norse and Northern European mythology. According to Ito, [...] " [...] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama". The main Final Fantasy IX website says {{the development of the}} game's world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the [...] "successful elements of the past, such as a return to the fantasy roots," [...] with newer elements. The creators made the characters a high priority. The return to the series' roots also affected the characters' designs, which resulted in characters with [...] "comic-like looks". Composer Nobuo Uematsu commented that the design staff attempted to give the characters realism while still appearing comic-like. To accomplish this, and to satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of Final Fantasy VIII, the designers stressed creating characters with whom the player could easily relate.|$|E

A song from the album, [...] "Addiction" [...] was released as a single. The group later went on tour, with a performance at Toronto's Concert Hall being released on VHS in 1989 and CD in 1991 as Ain't It Dead Yet?.

60|$|A {{glance at}} the {{confirmed}} inefficients at the bottom demonstrates that they are, as a rule, mental, physical, and moral wrecks.

"Never {{mind about}} thanks, Miss Armstrong; {{we are not}} out of the wood yet, our dangers are only half over, and if it were not that I trust to the cunning of our good friend Kreta and his Fingoes I should have very little hope of getting out of this mess.

6000|$|I {{think you}} will like the forest best in the sharp early spring-time, when it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> re-awaken, and innumerable violets peep from among the fallen leaves; when {{two or three people}} at most sit down to dinner, and, at table, you will do well to keep a rug about your knees, for the nights are chill, and the salle-à-manger opens on the court. There is less to {{distract}} the attention, for one thing, and the forest is more itself. It is not bedotted with artists' sunshades as with unknown mushrooms, nor bestrewn with the remains of English picnics. The hunting still goes on, and at any moment your heart may be brought into your mouth as you hear far-away horns; or you may be told by an agitated peasant that the Vicomte has gone up the avenue, not ten minutes since, [...] "à fond de train, monsieur, et avec douze piqueurs." ...|$|E
