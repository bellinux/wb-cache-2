(In both cases the stable {{physical}} open- or closed -situation would be switch in outer and string <b>in</b> <b>upper</b> <b>position.)</b> One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} indirect damage of guava leaf {{in the form of}} wax and honeydew covering by the spiraling whitefly (Aleurodicus dispersus) was investigated in a guava orchard, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Extent of leaf damage in twigs of different strata indicated that the upper most twigs had minimum wax and honeydew-covered leaves than the other twigs of guava plants. The results of the study on variation of leaf damage in different leaf position of twig showed that at early attacking stage the mean percentage of wax and honeydew covered leaves, was significantly higher in upper leaf position than in the middle and the lower leaf position and had the lowest level of whitefly infestation in the lower leaf position of the guava twigs. Results showed that with the build up of population in the month of December and January, wax and honeydew covered leaves were more in middle leaf position. The lower wax and honeydew covering <b>in</b> <b>upper</b> <b>position</b> were recorded in the later months due to rain and rapid growth of new flush, which remained non-infested...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a part of}} the results from {{experimental}} investigation of pulsating combustion with application on boiler model are presented. The Helmholtz-type water-cooled pulse combustor consists of a combustion chamber, a resonant pipe and aero-dynamic intake valves supplying air needed for combustion. Inside the boiler model a bundle of tubes is mounted representing one of the convective parts of the boiler. In case when the tube bundle is <b>in</b> <b>upper</b> <b>position,</b> the bottom of the boiler model represents the fire-place. Application of the pulse combustion burner on the boiler model refers basically to two zones: the fire-place and the convective part of the boiler. The laboratory experiments showed: weakening of the generated pressure pulsations of the exhaust gases on the boundary between burner and the interior of the boiler model; weakening of pressure pulsations in the free space of the boiler model; weakening of pressure pulsations during propagation through the tube bundle; impacts of the pulsating flow of the exhaust gases and generated sound energy {{on the walls of the}} boiler model. The experimental work is supported with numerical investigation of the pulsating combustion process. Combustion models included in FLUENT program package are used for calculations. It is shown that results from simulation are in good agreement with experiment. Key words: burner, pulse combustion, boiler model, sound energ...|$|E

40|$|In 2007 {{tests were}} carried out to {{determine}} the meristems which give rise to {{the different types of}} shoots and the basic factors affecting the evolution of the apical meristem and their lateral buds. The tests were conducted on potted plants in fertigation in two extremely different environmental conditions for light intensity (with shading to 50 % and with addition of artificial light). In May, one-year-old self-rooted plants of cvs. Arbequina IRTA-i 18, Koroneiki and Frantoio were introduced in fertigation {{and at the end of}} June were selected for uniformity of growth, distributed in the two zones and subjected to treatments: intact plants reared upright; plant topped at the first internode distinguishable with stem reared erect; plant cut at the base on the oldest wood. Four plants were used per treatment and cultivars distributed by blocks for each area. Similarly, fouryear-old ‘Coratina’ plants (three plants per treatment), raised on a single stem and acting on individual shoots (intact or topped) throughout the canopy, were utilized. The remarks focus on the origin of the shoots from thedifferent meristems and the growth and behavior of their lateral buds in the following season. Observations led to identification in the same bud complex of a vertical succession of two different types of buds: the “principal” bud and, <b>in</b> <b>upper</b> <b>position,</b> the “accessory” bud, the former with a reproductive role, the latter specialized in environmental exploitation (vegetative role). Starting from the primordia of an accessory bud, the apical meristem became “mature” growing in the time with important differences between the cultivars, acquiring only in the second year of growth for ‘Arbequina’ and ‘Koroneiki’ (early bearing cultivars) the capability to produce principal lateral buds able to develop in the inflorescences: with ‘Frantoio’ the “aging” of two years is not enough to move the principal buds to develop inflorescences. In the “mature” shoots the principal lateral buds can develop only as panicles, and the production of new bearing vegetation is limited to the central leader; all branches coming from accessory buds are dedicated to burst new vegetation.

The aim of our study was to compare the effect of head rotation 45 ° laterally in prone position on the increase <b>in</b> IOP of <b>upper</b> placed and lower placed eyes in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). MethodsForty-five patients were randomly divided into 2 Groups. IOP of the patients were recorded bilaterally in supine position before the operation had started. Patients were turned to prone position. The head was placed on a prone headrest without external direct compression to both eyes. Patients in Group I were kept in strictly neutral prone position where as patients in Group II were placed prone with their heads rotated 45 ° laterally to the right side. At {{the end of the}} operation, patients were turned to supine position and their IOP was measured immediately. ResultsThere was no difference related to demographics, duration of surgery, blood loss and fluid input data. IOP values after surgery in prone position increased significantly compared to preoperative values in both groups (p < 0. 05). After surgery in prone position IOP values of the <b>upper</b> <b>positioned</b> eyes <b>in</b> Group II were significantly lower than Group I and lower positioned eyes in Group II (p < 0. 05).
