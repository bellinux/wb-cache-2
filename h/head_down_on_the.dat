500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E
500|$|After Nancy Reagan {{accepted}} the flag, {{she approached the}} casket and spent several minutes patting and stroking it. She laid her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> casket, before breaking down and crying; The Washington Post described Nancy as having been [...] "stoic through nearly a week of somber rituals" [...] but she [...] "surrendered to her grief after being handed the flag that had covered her husband's coffin." [...] While she cried, she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, clutching the folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes. Funeral attendees {{had an opportunity to}} file past the coffin.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to her trial, Siddiqui {{said she}} was {{innocent}} of all charges. She maintained she could prove she was innocent but refused {{to do so in}} court. On 11 January 2010, Siddiqui told the judge that she would not co-operate with her attorneys and wanted to fire them. She said she did not trust the judge and added, [...] "I'm boycotting the trial, just to let all of you know. There's too many injustices." [...] She then put her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defence table as the prosecution proceeded.|$|E
5000|$|Rolleifix: Instead of {{screwing}} {{the camera}} body to a tripod, this tripod <b>head</b> clamps <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> TLR.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{laid her}} <b>head</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow and, {{kneeling}} beside her, {{held her hand}} in his.|$|R
60|$|Philip stood silent, very white, {{trembling}} a little, {{with his}} <b>head</b> bent <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book. The master's breathing grew almost stertorous.|$|R
60|$|For Joe had {{actually}} laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow at my side, {{and put his}} arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.|$|E
6000|$|He started, {{and looked}} wildly round him, as if {{listening}} for some sound which he expected, and then laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. [...] Lancelot turned to go.|$|E
60|$|The father let it fall, {{laid his}} <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roller-top of the shut desk, and breathed heavily. The {{secretary}} ran for Mrs. Cheyne's doctor, who found Cheyne pacing to and fro.|$|E
60|$|Tyee clambered in, {{dragged him}} up with {{his back against the}} wall, but <b>the</b> <b>head</b> hung <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chest and sobbed and wailed.|$|R
60|$|Adam laid <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fern again, and {{emptying}} {{the tools}} {{out of the}} flag-basket, hurried through the trees {{to the edge of}} <b>the</b> Grove bordering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chase, where a brook ran below the bank.|$|R
5000|$|SU074337 <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> footpath, {{under the}} railway line then {{across the river}} into South Newton.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought, oh! long ago, that I {{would marry}} him myself. But {{you knew him}} first [...] . And he only saved me [...] . But you saved him!' [...] . And then she laid her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{throbbing}} bosom, and sobbed [...] .|$|E
60|$|He {{showed me}} a faded little picture, and when I tried to comfort him, he laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{pedestal}} {{of one of the}} marble queens who guard the walk, as if he never cared to lift it up again.|$|E
60|$|The armourer, indeed, {{while he}} heard the lips that were dearest to him paint his {{character}} in such unfavourable colours, had laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, upon his folded arms, in an attitude of the deepest dejection, or almost despair.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics for years and years and years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{it must be}} {{confessed that}} a tear or two dimmed the blue eyes, and once, when a very {{brilliant}} display illuminated the island for a moment, and she fancied she saw the tents, <b>the</b> curly <b>head</b> went <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railing, and a wide-awake nasturtium heard a little whisper, ...|$|R
500|$|Adult {{and young}} New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a range of}} vocalisations. An adult female can produce a repeated throaty [...] "roar" [...] when approached by another adult. The young start communicating with each other while still in the egg; this may help synchronise hatching. Newly hatched juveniles use various yelps and grunts. When startled, a warning sound emitted by one will send all the juveniles diving {{to the bottom of the}} water. Adults in the vicinity respond with growls, threats, and attacks. The distress noises of a youngster when handled at a ranching facility was observed to cause all the larger animals to become involved in frenzied activity, with some rushing towards the juvenile and others thrashing about in the water and slapping their <b>heads</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|R
60|$|Then, as the {{darkness}} closed in, the daughter laid her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, {{and they both}} lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go and say {{something}} to him; I can't; poor old father, if I 'd only known," [...] and to Polly's utter dismay, Tom threw himself into a chair, and laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, {{as if he had}} got a blow that was too much for him.|$|E
60|$|As {{he began}} to realize it all and to think how terrible was this loss, he laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> car-seat before him and cried. His first great trial had come to him, and meeting it like a man, he must now weep like a woman.|$|E
60|$|In {{the middle}} of the room a man lay {{stretched}} upon the floor, face downwards. The blood was slowly trickling from a wound in the side of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> carpet. With nearly every breath he drew he groaned. Overturned chairs and tables showed that he had taken part in no ordinary struggle. The condition of the other man also testified this.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited to}} see her take her draught, and lay her <b>head</b> <b>down</b> once more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow. Then, hoping he would get a sleep, I rose to go.|$|R
60|$|Worn {{out with}} her own emotions, and {{yielding}} to {{the silence of the}} room, her hand slowly slackened and failed in its fanning movement, and her <b>head</b> dropped <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow at her father's side. Clennam rose softly, opened and closed the door without a sound, and passed from the prison, carrying the quiet with him into the turbulent streets.|$|R
6000|$|They worked, he talking, she {{with her}} <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> book. He was quick and hasty. She never answered. Occasionally, when he demanded of her, [...] "Do you see?" [...] {{she looked up}} at him, her eyes wide with the half-laugh that comes of fear. [...] "Don't you?" [...] he cried.|$|E
60|$|Clennam, however, {{finding him}} already {{beginning}} to be pacified, had said {{all he wanted to}} say, and more. He wrung his hand, only adding, 'Blind leaders of the blind, Pancks! Blind leaders of the blind! But Doyce, Doyce, Doyce; my injured partner!' That brought his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> desk once more.|$|E
60|$|He {{addressed}} his aunt, but {{his eyes}} were on his father; and when he heard not a single word from him, he suddenly ceased, and presently, laying his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window-sill, he begged that no one would stand and watch him, he should come into the library in a few minutes.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Lavender {{shook his}} <b>head,</b> and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of a}} green leather chair. The editor, {{resuming}} his seat, crossed his legs deferentially, and sinking his chin again on his chest, began: ...|$|R
50|$|Following brief repairs, Bat <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> river <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 11th and {{anchored}} in Hampton Roads the next day. Awaiting her was word that Porter {{expected to be}} there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 13th and orders {{to be ready to}} take him to Washington. However, the admiral did not arrive until the 14th and then remained in Tristram Shandy, the ship that had brought him from City Point, {{for the remainder of the}} homeward voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where in this world, indeed?" [...] {{repeated}} Lilias Fay; and, being {{faint and}} weary--the more {{so by the}} heaviness of her heart--the Lily drooped her <b>head</b> and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit of a knoll, repeating, [...] "Where in this world shall we build our temple?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hetty {{emptied the}} box of cartridges, and, with hands that {{did not seem to}} tremble, stood it up before the lamp. Once more the man {{crouched}} by the window, a blurred, huddled object with <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rifle stock, and there was another streak of flame. Then, the thud of the axes suddenly ceased, and he laughed a little discordant laugh.|$|E
60|$|Florence had need of help. Her father's need {{of it was}} sore, {{and made}} the aid of her old friend invaluable. Death stood at his pillow. A shade, already, {{of what he had}} been, {{shattered}} in mind, and perilously sick in body, he laid his weary <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed his daughter's hands prepared for him, and had never raised it since.|$|E
60|$|They were in {{the grove}} now, close by the stile, and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence {{was too much for}} him. So he just laid his <b>head</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Would yer?' he said, {{catching}} {{hold of it}} and wrenching it {{from her}} grasp. He threw {{it to the end}} of the room and grappled with her. For a moment they swayed about from side to side, then with an effort he lifted her off her feet and threw her to the ground; but she caught hold of him and he came <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of her. She screamed as her <b>head</b> thumped <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, and the children, who were standing huddled up in a corner, terrified, screamed too.|$|R

5000|$|PWRDWN: When Eagles were made, hard-disk read/write <b>heads</b> {{would come}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platter when turned off, and data {{could be lost}} unless they were first moved to a special location. The PWRDWN command parked the head so an Eagle with a hard disk could be turned off safely.|$|R
