5|$|INS Shakti can refuel four ships at a time, with a <b>fuelling</b> {{speed of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour while her {{predecessors}} had {{a speed of}} 300 per hour. She is also equipped with state-of-the art electronics, medical facilities and storage spaces. According to Admiral Nirmal Verma, Shakti would significantly add to the Indian Navy's ability to conduct and sustain operations distant from the coast.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Air Force retaliated {{for these}} attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on <b>fuelling</b> {{facilities}} for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty. The Indian Navy anticipated this attack {{and had already}} moved the missile boats to other locations to prevent any losses. However, {{the destruction of a}} special fuel tank prevented any further incursions until Operation Python, executed three days later.|$|E
5|$|Halsey {{chose to}} follow Nimitz's request. His fleet {{completed}} <b>fuelling</b> on 19 January, and proceeded north towards the Balintang Channel; Task Group 30.8 {{separated from the}} main body, however, and subsequently passed through the Surigao Strait. During 20 January the fleet sailed east through the Balintang Channel, with a division of destroyers patrolling well ahead of the carrier task groups. A large number of Japanese aircraft were detected by radar during this period, and 15 which were evacuating Imperial Japanese Army Air Force personnel from Luzon were shot down. No attack was made against the American force. The Third Fleet exited the Balintang Channel at 10 pm that night.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before <b>fuelling</b> of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which had shut down when the computer failed.|$|E
5|$|The Deepak-class tanker {{can carry}} 17,900 tonnes of cargo, {{including}} 15,500 tonnes of liquid cargo (water, ship and aircraft fuel) and 500 tonnes of solid cargo (victuals and ammunition). The modern cargo handling facility {{on board the}} ship enables transfer of heavy solid cargo via a 30 tonne capacity deck crane, and simultaneous <b>fuelling</b> of multiple ships at sea, and can refuel {{at the rate of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour. Workshop facilities on the ship can support other ships of the fleet and it is capable of supporting heavy helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as an {{interceptor}} aircraft. It {{was the first}} jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset {{it was clear that}} the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its removable gun pack, pressurised <b>fuelling</b> system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} detailed thermodynamics models for naturally aspirated gasoline and alternative <b>fuelled</b> to spark ignition internal combustion engines {{on the basis}} of ideal Otto cycle. A comparative study based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics are discussed here. The key parameters for analysis are considered as mean effective pressure (MEP), power, torque, exergetic efficiency, second law efficiency, and irreversibility. Air standard assumptions were taken consideration for the analyses. MEP, power output and torque for all alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines, are higher compared to that of a gasoline engine. Exergy due to heat and work are also discussed here. For heat exergy, only hydrogen exceeds gasoline while other alternative fuels have lower heat exergy than gasoline. But work (mechanical) exergy for all the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are higher than the gasoline engine. The Irreversibility or losses for the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are significantly lower than a gasoline engine. Alternative fuel engines have lower specific fuel consumption than the gasoline engine. Hence the 1 st law and second law efficiency of the alternative <b>fuelled</b> engines are higher compared to that of gasoline. This is also due to having a high compression ratio associated with alternative <b>fuelled</b> internal combustion engine. Exergy heat transfer of alternative <b>fuelled</b> internal combustion engine is higher due to having high heat generation during combustion...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{review on}} performance and emission characteristics of twin {{spark ignition engine}} <b>fuelled</b> by gasoline and natural gas. Here, it will be shown that due to lower volumetric efficiency and lean effect in CNG <b>Fuelled</b> SI engine, the maximum torque generated is diminished compared to gasoline <b>fuelled</b> engines. We showed that the torque reduction can be recovered and performance of single spark CNG engine can be enhanced by modifying twin spark ignition system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{performance}} analysis on CRGT power plants <b>fuelled</b> by DME, {{which is a}} potentially attractive fuel for gas turbines. The study also includes {{a performance comparison of}} simple cycle gas turbines <b>fuelled</b> by natural gas, DME and methanol. The study shows that, owing to the exhaust heat recovery carried out through DME pre-heating and vaporization before combustion, the efficiency of the DME <b>fuelled</b> turbine improves by about 1 point, without any significant change in power output. Thermochemical recuperation in DME <b>fuelled</b> turbines allows to achieve a significant performance improvement. For the highest water/DME molar ratio allowed by the minimum temperature difference here assumed, the power output of the CRGT plant is 44...|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, the Mount Vernon complex, {{which was}} {{initially}} intended for the storage of ashes from recent deaths, could no longer cope with the scale of exhumation projects <b>fuelling</b> the demand for columbarium niches. Another crematorium and columbarium complex was built at Mandai, and this commenced operations in 1982, equipped with eight small and four medium-sized cremators and a total of 64,370 niches for the storage of cremated remains. Chinese voluntary associations such as Pek San Theng were allowed to build columbaria to house the remains of those exhumed from clan-owned cemeteries, and temples and churches were allowed to accommodate cremated remains. Mount Vernon Crematorium ceased operations on 30 June 2004.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1720s, a {{constitutional}} struggle began between the Provost and the Fellows, {{culminating in a}} lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, Edmund Gibson, then Bishop of Lincoln. The Provost continued to reject candidates, <b>fuelling</b> discontent among the Fellows, until a writ of attachment against the Bishop of Lincoln was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the original statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second versiont, claiming the Bishop of Lincoln as Visitor. The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.|$|E
5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence fee on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and <b>fuelling</b> compensation culture.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, {{shifted the}} capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, {{increasing}} the city's importance. A new grand palace {{along with other}} state buildings {{was built in the}} new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, <b>fuelling</b> hopes of economic boom.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{and early}} January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against {{neutralism}} and French President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated {{the removal of}} the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta of having an uncertain stance on the issue and went as far as to recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, <b>fuelling</b> speculation that French agents were being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.|$|E
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of weak {{vertical}} wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression intensified. By 06:00UTC the next morning, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Beta by the NHC. Beta was slowly moving towards the north-northwest {{in response to a}} mid-tropospheric shortwave trough over the Gulf of Mexico and mid-tropospheric ridge to the northeast of the storm. Deep convection developed near the center of circulation, signifying a developing system. With favorable conditions for development, Beta was forecast to intensify into a hurricane before making landfall in central Nicaragua. An eyewall rapidly developed around the center of circulation, <b>fuelling</b> further intensification. With the formation of an eyewall and the compact size of the storm, rapid intensification was anticipated. By the end of October27, maximum sustained winds around the center of Beta were estimated at 60mph (95km/h). An increase in wind shear caused a minor disruption of the storm's structure, briefly preventing strengthening.|$|E

5|$|On {{the supply}} side, since 2005 the {{gasoline}} <b>fuelling</b> stations selling more than 3 million liters of fuel {{a year are}} required to sell at least one type of biofuel, resulting in more than 1,200 gas stations selling E85 by August 2008. Despite all the sharp growth of E85 flexifuel cars, by 2007 they represented just {{two percent of the}} four million Swedish vehicles. In addition, this law also mandated all new filling stations to offer alternative fuels, and stations with an annual volume of more than one million liters are required to have an alternative fuel pump by December 2009. Therefore, the number of E85 pumps is expected to reach by 2009 nearly 60% of Sweden's 4,000 filling stations.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{established}} First Nation treaty rights, {{created the}} Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration {{at a time}} that the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further <b>fuelling</b> anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding <b>fuelling</b> arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, <b>fuelling</b> inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for <b>fuelling</b> lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a vertical position for <b>fuelling</b> and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E
