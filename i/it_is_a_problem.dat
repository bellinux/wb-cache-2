500|$|Pugs are one {{of several}} breeds that are more {{susceptible}} than other dogs to demodectic mange, also known as [...] "demodex". This condition is caused when parasitic mites, that are often present in a dog's skin without causing symptoms, are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for many young Pugs, although not usually a major one, and is easily treatable, but some are especially susceptible and present with a systemic form of the condition. This vulnerability {{is thought to be}} genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from adults who have this condition. In 2008, an investigative documentary carried out by the BBC found significant inbreeding between pedigree dogs, with a study by Imperial College, London, showing that the 10,000 Pugs in the UK are so inbred that their gene pool is the equivalent of only 50 individuals.|$|E
500|$|In May 2002, {{hundreds}} of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall {{were involved in}} disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to Birmingham City. It was described by the BBC {{as one of the}} worst cases of civil disorder seen in Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events. The then chairman Theo Paphitis responded that Millwall could not be blamed for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. [...] "The problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> which plagues the whole of our society", he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: [...] "In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder". Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall's away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of West Yorkshire Police's choosing {{on the day of the}} game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.|$|E

2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition.

If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified.

2500|$|For solids and liquids like bone, {{muscle and}} blood, this added {{pressure}} {{is not much}} of a problem; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for any air-filled spaces like the mouth, ears, paranasal sinuses and lungs.

The danger of pressure damage is greatest in shallow water because the ratio of pressure change is greatest near the surface of the water. For example, the pressure increase between the surface and 10m (33ft) is 100% (100 kPa to 200 kPa), but the pressure increase from 30m (100ft) to 40m (130ft) is only 25% (400 kPa to 500 kPa).|$|E

Mrs Christie has not given herself room for such unfolding, and is therefore constrained to tear the buds brutally apart. This plot would, I think, have furnished forth a whole novel. In the other three stories, each of that long-short form which used to be sacred to the penny detective adventure story, Poirot is but palely himself, and in each case the plot, though clever, is not brilliant.

2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the underdense plasma corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E
