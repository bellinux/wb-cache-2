The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configuration</b> with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E

40|$|Within the Landau-de Gennes {{theory of}} liquid crystals, we study {{theoretically}} the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configurations</b> with uniaxial symmetry. For an arbitrary {{form of the}} bulk energy density, we show that energy minimizers among uniaxially symmetric configurations are usually not <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configurations.</b> It was known before that uniaxiality can sometimes be broken by energy minimizers. We prove here that this is always the case {{in one or two}} dimensions. Even more we prove that <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configurations</b> (not only minimizers) cannot be uniaxial in one or two dimensions (unless they are constant). Namely, uniaxial <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configurations</b> with at least one translational invariance direction must have a uniform director field. In the case of a hybrid nematic cell, or of a capillary with radial anchoring, our result implies that biaxial escape always occurs, and that it does so not only in the core of a defect: uniaxial order is destroyed in the whole cell.

25|$|This {{definition}} remains meaningful {{even when}} the system is far away from equilibrium. Other definitions assume {{that the system is}} in thermal equilibrium, either as an isolated system, or as a system in exchange with its surroundings. The set of microstates (with probability distribution) on which the sum is done is called a statistical ensemble. Each type of statistical ensemble (micro-canonical, canonical, grand-canonical, etc.) describes a different configuration of the system's exchanges with the outside, varying from a completely isolated system to a system that can exchange one or more quantities with a reservoir, like energy, volume or molecules. In every ensemble, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>configuration</b> of the system is dictated by the maximization of the entropy of the union of the system and its reservoir, according to the second law of thermodynamics (see the statistical mechanics article).|$|E
