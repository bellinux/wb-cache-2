25|$|Becker muscular {{dystrophy}} is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle {{weakness of the}} legs and pelvis. It {{is a type of}} <b>dystrophinopathy.</b> This is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes the protein dystrophin. Becker {{muscular dystrophy}} is related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in that both result from a mutation in the dystrophin gene.|$|E
50|$|If DNA testing {{fails to}} find the mutation, a muscle biopsy test may be performed. A small sample of muscle tissue is {{extracted}} using a biopsy needle. The key tests performed on the biopsy sample for DMD are immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting for dystrophin, and should be interpreted by an experienced neuromuscular pathologist. These tests provide information on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein. Absence of the protein is a positive test for DMD. Where dystrophin is present, the tests indicate the amount and molecular size of dystrophin, helping to distinguish DMD from milder <b>dystrophinopathy</b> phenotypes. Over the past several years, DNA tests have been developed that detect more of the many mutations that cause the condition, and muscle biopsy is not required as often to confirm the presence of DMD.|$|E
50|$|Exon {{skipping}} is {{induced by}} eteplirsen, a charge-neutral, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) that selectively binds to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, restoring {{the phase of}} the reading frame and enabling production of functional, but truncated, dystrophin. The uncharged nature of the PMO helps make it resistant to biological degradation. This truncated dystrophin protein produced by eteplirsen causes a less severe form of <b>dystrophinopathy,</b> much like Becker muscular dystrophy. PMO technology to treat other genotypes amenable to exon skipping could potentially treat an estimated 70 to 80% of all DMD patients with dystrophin gene deletion. Eteplirsen's proposed mechanism of action is to bind to pre-mRNA {{needed to make a}} particular muscle protein, dystrophin, and rearrange the splicing of the RNA so that more dystrophin is made. By increasing the quantity of an abnormal, but potentially functional, dystrophin protein, the objective is to slow or prevent the progression of DMD.|$|E

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD), Becker {{muscular dystrophy}} (BMD), and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XL-DCM) {{consist of a}} unique clinical entity, the <b>dystrophinopathies,</b> which are due to variable mutations in the dystrophin gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common complication of <b>dystrophinopathies,</b> but the onset, progression, and severity of heart disease differ among these subgroups. Extensive molecular genetic {{studies have been conducted}} to assess genotype-phenotype correlation in DMD, BMD, and XL-DCM to understand the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, but the results are not always conclusive, suggesting the involvement of complex multi-layers of pathological processes that generate the final clinical phenotype. Dystrophin protein is a part of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) that is localized in skeletal muscles, myocardium, smooth muscles, and neuronal tissues. Diversity of cardiac phenotype in <b>dystrophinopathies</b> suggests multiple layers of pathogenetic mechanisms in forming dystrophic cardiomyopathy. In this review article, we review the complex molecular interactions involving the pathogenesis of dystrophic cardiomyopathy, including primary gene mutations and loss of structural integrity, secondary cellular responses, and certain epigenetic and other factors that modulate gene expressions.

This thesis {{is a collection}} of several clinical and genetic studies on <b>dystrophinopathies</b> with implications for genetic counselling of patients and their families and for future therapy (e. g. personalized medicine) of patients suffering from this group of chronic progressive muscle diseases. The following recommendations are made: - Testing for <b>dystrophinopathies</b> in newborn boys on a voluntary basis should start as soon as possible in the Netherlands. This will reduce the chance of the birth of subsequent affected boys in the family and will also help in early introduction of possible therapy when this becomes available. - Parents should be given the choice of having their daughters tested prenatally, if foetal DNA is available. They should also be encouraged to have their daughters tested, even before adulthood. This will not only considerably reduce the incidence of DMD but will also ease the burden for the parents who have to inform their daughter of their future risks. - Genetic counsellors should have a more active approach to cascade screening and informing the patients and their families of their risks and possibilities.

40|$|Cramps and myalgias are {{frequent}} presentations of many disorders whose diagnosis is generally difficult. Among the unusual causes stand the milder phenotypes of <b>dystrophinopathies,</b> which are caused, just as Duchenne and Beckerâ€™s dystrophy, by mutations in the dystrophin gene.

40|$|<b>Dystrophinopathy</b> is the commonest form of muscular {{dystrophy}} and comprises clinically recognized forms, Duchenne dystrophy and Becker dystrophy. Mutations in the dystrophin gene which consist of large gene deletions (65), duplications (5) and point mutations (30) {{are responsible for}} {{reducing the amount of}} functional dystrophin protein in skeletal muscle fibres leading to fibre destruction and disease. The aims of this study are to investigate the detection rate, types and distribution of large gene deletions in Malaysian <b>dystrophinopathy</b> patients using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR). MPCR of 18 "hot-spot deletion" regions along the dystrophin gene was performed on DNA from 48 muscle biopsy-confirmed cases of <b>dystrophinopathy.</b> A positive detection rate of 58 (28 / 48) was observed, where 84 (16 / 19) Indian, 35 (6 / 17) Chinese and 50 (6 / 12) Malay ethnic groups showed deletions in their dystrophin genes. The Malaysian Indians appear to have a higher prevalence for large gene deletions compared to the Chinese and Malays. Further analyses of 42 confirmed positive cases (present 28 plus previous 14 cases) by MPCR showed the majority of deletions were in the mid-distal region of the dystrophin gene (81 in exons 45 - 60).

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} exercise response during cardiopulmonary {{exercise testing}} {{in children and}} adolescents with <b>dystrophinopathies.</b> Methods: Exercise response on the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was compared with a standard care test protocol. Results: Nine boys (aged 10. 8 +/- 4. 7 years) with Becker muscular dystrophy (n = 6) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n = 3) were included. The feasibility of the CPET was similar to a standard care test protocol, and no serious adverse events occurred. In 67 % of the subjects with normal or only mildly impaired functional capacity, the CPET could be used to detect moderate to severe cardiopulmonary exercise limitations. Conclusions: The CPET seems to be a promising outcome measure for cardiopulmonary exercise limitations in youth with mild functional limitations.

40|$|Abstract Dystrophin gene {{mutations}} cause <b>dystrophinopathies,</b> a {{group of}} phenotypes manifesting with striated muscle involvement. The expression of dystrophin is finely regulated and splicing {{plays a major role}} in modulating the phenotype. Recently both in vitro and in vivo modulation of dystrophin mutations by using antisense-mediated targeted exon skipping has been proven to be effective for restoring dystrophin synthesis, opening therapeutic perspectives. There are also increasing evidences that intronic regions contain regulatory elements as well as transcribe for non coding-RNA. The project, taking advantage of a large series of patients with <b>dystrophinopathies</b> available in our Unit, aims at: I) the identification and the characterisation of nonâ€“coding RNAs and related regulatory sequences possibly involved in dystrophinopathic phenotypes; ii) the modulation by antisense-mediated targeted exon skipping of dystrophin mutations in patientâ€™s derived myogenic cells. We will search for both conserved and non conserved transcripts within the dystrophin introns. We will investigate both their structural/functional characteristics and their relationship with dystrophin mutations/phenotypes by exploring their transcriptional status in patientâ€™s tissues and by evaluating the occurrence in them of functional motifs. In selected patients with no mutations at the exonic level, we will explore the identified non-coding RNAs for the presence of causative mutations.

The pathogenesis of <b>dystrophinopathies</b> {{as well as the}} genotype-phenotype correlation have not been entirely elucidated. The project proposed a strategy to identify, characterise and modulate nonâ€“coding regulatory sequences, with particular attention to the splicing regulatory motifs. The approach takes advantage of a large series of patients with <b>dystrophinopathies</b> already characterised. Among these, we selected two categories: 1) in which the causative mutation is disobeying the Monaco frame theory in terms of phenotype/genotype relationship, 2) in which no mutations at the coding level have been found. In these selected cases, we will analyse both the genomic configuration and the RNA editing in the available tissues in order to obtain the breakpoint definition and to identify mutations located within non-coding regions. We will also focalise our attention on LINE 1 mobile elements in the dystrophin gene, given their role in the human genome and their involvement in genetic diseases. We will evaluate both their structural/functional characteristics and their relationship with dystrophin mutations by exploring their transcription status and the occurrence in them of functional motifs. Following these steps, sequence comparative analysis will focus the presence within the intronic regions explored of conserved non-coding sequences, and functional assays will allow the evaluation of their role in splicing modulation. Antisense interference will allow both the confirmation of the functional significance of the identified motifs in splicing and attempt a modulation of the splicing process via a restoration of the wild type RNA phenotype.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} {{is one of}} the most common lethal monogenic disorders and is caused by dystrophin deficiency. The disease is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait; however, recent biochemical and clinical studies have shown that many girls and women with a primary myopathy have an underlying <b>dystrophinopathy,</b> despite a negative family history for Duchenne dystrophy. These isolated female <b>dystrophinopathy</b> patients carried ambiguous diagnoses with presumed autosomal recessive inheritance (limbgirdle {{muscular dystrophy}}) prior to biochemical detection of dystrophin abnormalities in their muscle biopsy. It has been assumed that these female <b>dystrophinopathy</b> patients are heterozygous carriers who show preferential inactivation of the X chromosome harboring the normal dystrophin gene, although this has been shown for only a few X:autosome translocations and for two cases of discordant monozygotic twin female carriers. Here we study X-inactivation patterns of 13 female <b>dystrophinopathy</b> patientsâ€” 10 isolated cases and 3 cases with a positive family history for Duchenne dystrophy in males. We show that all cases have skewed X-inactivation patterns in peripheral blood DNA. Of the nine isolated cases informative in our assay, eight showed inheritance of the dystrophin gene mutation from the paternal germ line. Only a single case showed maternal inheritance. The 10 -fold higher incidence of paternal transmission of dystrophin gene mutations in these cases is at 30 -fold variance with Bayesian predictions and gene mutation rates. Thus, our results suggest some mechanistic interaction between new dystrophin gene mutations, paternal inheritance, and skewed X inactivation.

Dystrophin gene mutations usually affect men, but reportedly 2. 5 â€“ 7. 8 % of women are affected and are classified as symptomatic carriers. The {{aim of this study}} was to clinically and genetically characterize symptomatic female dystrophi-nopathy carriers. MethodszzThe clinical and genetic data of 11 female <b>dystrophinopathy</b> carriers among 285 pa-tients who underwent multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis for the dystrophin gene were reviewed. Women with muscle weakness and/or dilated cardiomy-opathy were classified as symptomatic carriers, while subjects with high serum creatine kinase (CK) levels and/or minor myopathic signs such as muscle cramps and myalgia were classified as asymptomatic. ResultszzTwelve female carriers were identified, but 1 symptomatic carrier who also had Turn-er syndrome was excluded from the study. Of the 11 included female carriers, 4 were symptom-atic and 7 were asymptomatic. The age at symptom onset in the symptomatic female carriers ranged from 15 to 31 years (mean, 30. 6 years), and the age at diagnosis for asymptomatic car-riers ranged from 4 to 38 years (mean, 24. 5 years). Serum CK levels were markedly elevated (mean, 1, 301 IU/mL) in three of the four (75 %) symptomatic female carriers, and mildly ele-vated in three of the seven (42 %) asymptomatic female carriers.

40|$|Dystrophin is a subsarcolemmal protein that, {{by linking}} the actin {{cytoskeleton}} to the extracellular matrix via dystroglycans, {{is critical for}} the integrity of muscle fibers.

In addition the full length muscle isoform mDp 427 was clearly detectable in melanocyte cultures as assessed by immunohistochemistry, RNA and western blot analysis. Melanocytes of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients did not express dystrophin, and the ultrastructural analysis revealed typical mitochondrial alterations similar to those occurring in myoblasts from the same patients. Mitochondria of melanocytes from DMD patients readily accumulated tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester, indicating that they are energized irrespective {{of the presence of}} dystrophin but, at variance from mitochondria of control donors, depolarized upon the addition of oligomycin, suggesting that they are affected by a latent dysfunction unmasked by inhibition of the ATP synthase.

XLDCM is caused by mutations of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene and results in lethal heart failure in individuals between 10 and 20 years. Patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, an allelic disorder, have a milder phenotype of skeletal muscle involvement compared to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and sometimes present with dilated cardiomyopathy. The precise relationship between mutations in the DMD gene and cardiomyopathy remain unclear. However, some hypothetical mechanisms are being considered {{to be associated with}} the presence of some several dystrophin isoforms, certain reported mutations, and an unknown dystrophin-related pathophysiological mechanism. Recent therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the severe <b>dystrophinopathy</b> phenotype, appears promising, but the presence of XLDCM highlights the importance of focusing on cardiomyopathy while elucidating the pathomechanism and developing treatment...|$|E
40|$|Two {{new cases}} of dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DC) caused by <b>dystrophinopathy</b> are reported. One patient, a 24 Â year old man, had {{a family history of}} X linked DC, while the other, a 52 Â year old man, had sporadic disease. Each had abnormal dystrophin immunostaining in muscle or cardiac biopsy specimens, but neither had muscle weakness. Serum creatine kinase activity was raised only in the patient with familial disease. Analysis of dystrophin gene mutations showed a deletion of exons 48 - 49 in the patient with familial DC and of exons 49 - 51 in the other. Dystrophin transcription in cardiac tissue from the patient with sporadic disease showed abundant expression, predominantly of the muscle isoform. This study, together with previous reports, suggests that some patients with DC have a <b>dystrophinopathy</b> that can be diagnosed using a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses. â€¨â€¨ Keywords: dilated cardiomyopathy;Â  dystrophin;Â  Becker muscular dystroph...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work was to study {{the natural history of}} <b>dystrophinopathies</b> and the genotype-phenotype correlations made possible by the development of the clinical part of the French DMD database. The collection of 70, 000 Â clinical data for 600 Â patients with an average longitudinal follow-up of 12 years enabled clarification of the natural history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and clinical presentations in symptomatic females. We were able to specify the phenotypic heterogeneity of motor, orthopedic and respiratory involvements (severe, standard and intermediary form), of the cardiac disorder (severe, standard or absent cardiomyopathy, absence of correlation between motor and cardiac involvements), and of brain function (mental deficiency in the patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, psychopathological disorders in <b>dystrophinopathies).</b> Phenotypic variability did not correlate with a specific mutational spectrum. We propose a model of phenotypic analysis based on the presence or not of muscular and cardiac involvements (described by age at onset and rate of progression) and brain involvement (described by the type and the severity of the cognitive impairment and of the psychological disorders). The methodology developed for the DMD gene can be generalized and used for other databases dedicated to genetic diseases. Application of this model of phenotypic analysis for each patient and further development of the database should contribute substantially to clinical research providing useful tools for future clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn dystrophin-deficient fibers of mdx {{mice and}} in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, {{inflammation}} and increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) contribute to myonecrosis. We {{examined the effects}} of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on dystrophic muscle degeneration. Mdx mice (14 days old) received EPA for 16 days. The sternomastoid, diaphragm and biceps brachii muscles were removed. Control mdx mice received vehicle. EPA decreased creatine kinase and myonecrosis and reduced the levels of TNF-Î±. These results suggest that EPA plays a protective role in dystrophic muscle degeneration, possibly by reducing TNF-Î±, and support further investigations of EPA as a potential therapy for <b>dystrophinopathies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Muscular dystrophies are a {{heterogeneous}} group of inherited disorders that share similar clinical features and dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy, associated with progressive weakness. Weakness may be noted at birth or develop in late adult life. In recent years, cardiac involvement {{has been observed}} in {{a growing number of}} genetic muscle diseases, and considerable {{progress has been made in}} understanding the relationships between disease skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle disease. This review will focus on the skeletal muscle diseases most commonly associated with cardiac complications that can be diagnosed by echocardiography, such as <b>dystrophinopathies</b> including Duchenne (DMD) and Becker (BMD) muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathy of DMD/BMD carriers and X-L dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
