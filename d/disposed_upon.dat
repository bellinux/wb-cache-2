60|$|The leaping glare beyond sent a ray {{into his}} corner {{and for a}} moment every little detail was distinct. It was Marshal Dubois. He was lying against a huge slab of the war map. To it there stuck and from it there dangled little wooden objects, the symbols of {{infantry}} and cavalry and guns, as they were <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the frontier. He {{did not seem to be}} aware of this at his back, he had an effect of inattention, not indifferent attention, but as if he were thinking....|$|E
60|$|This being determined, they departed, {{leaving the}} Count {{in the company}} of the jester. Francesco spread his cloak, and lay down again, whilst the fool, craving his {{permission}} to remain, <b>disposed</b> himself <b>upon</b> his haunches like a Turk.|$|R

60|$|It {{is to be}} remembered, that {{although}} his Excellency cannot be properly said to bestow bishoprics, commands in the army, {{the place of a}} judge, or commissioner in the revenue, and some others; yet they are, for the most part, <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> his recommendation, except where the persons are immediately sent from England by their interest at Court, for which I have allowed large defalcations in the following accounts. And it is remarkable that the only considerable station conferred on a reputed Tory since his present Excellency's government was of this latter kind.|$|E

[...] I looked into this young man's tenement; {{it was not only}} neat, but ornamented with a great variety of engravings tastefully <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the wall. On my expressing my pleasure in this circumstance, he added, [...] "It is one of the pleasantest features of the case, to notice how soon they began to ornament their little dwellings; some have cages with singing birds, and some pots of flowering plants; some, pictures and engravings." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{site of the}} Gasr is {{in north}} lat. 25° 55' 15";[EN#70] and {{the centre of the}} Libn block bears from it 339° (mag.). It stands upon the very edge of its Wady's left bank, a clifflet some twenty-five feet high, sloping inland with the usual dark metal <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> loose yellow sand. Thus it {{commands}} a glorious view of the tree-grown valley, or rather valleys, beneath it; and of the picturesque peaks of the Tihámat-Balawíyyah in the background. The distance from the sea is now a little over three miles--in ancient days it may have been much less.|$|E

6000|$|... § XXXV. The reader {{has been}} told repeatedly[89] that there are two, and only two, real orders of capitals, {{originally}} represented by the Corinthian and the Doric; and distinguished by the concave or convex contours of their bells, {{as shown by the}} dotted lines at e, Fig. V., p. 65. And hitherto, respecting the capital, we have been exclusively concerned with the methods in which these two families of simple contours have gathered themselves together, and obtained reconciliation to the abacus above, and the shaft below. But the last paragraph introduces us to the surface ornament <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> these, in the chiselling of which the characters described above, § XXVIII., which are but feebly marked in the cornice, boldly distinguish and divide the families of the capital.|$|E

The cabin-a miserable box {{about the size of the}} poop, and three feet high-was stuffed, like the hold of a slave ship, with fifteen wretches, children and women, and the other ninety-seven were <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the luggage or squatted on the bulwarks. Having some experience in such matters, and being favoured by fortune, I found a spare bed-frame slung to the ship's side; and giving a dollar to its owner, a sailor-who flattered himself that, because it was his, he would sleep upon it,-I instantly appropriated it, preferring any hardship outside, to the condition of a packed herring inside, the place of torment.|$|E
60|$|According {{to their}} custom all, with the {{exception}} of the man on guard, sought sleep early, nor, once <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the ground for slumber, were they long in finding it. It seemed to Bradley that he had scarcely closed his eyes when he was brought to his feet, wide awake, by a piercing scream which was punctuated by the sharp report of a rifle from the direction of the fire where Tippet stood guard. As he ran toward the man, Bradley heard above him the same uncanny wail that had set every nerve on edge several nights before, and the dismal flapping of huge wings. He did not need to look up at the white-shrouded figure winging slowly away into the night to know that their grim visitor had returned.|$|E
50|$|On 10 November 1988, Shadwell, {{decommissioned}} and {{now known}} as ex-USS Shadwell, {{was transferred to the}} Fire Research Detachment, Little Sand Island, Mobile Bay, Alabama. She is serving as a test and training platform in the development of fire models and other damage and control systems. Shadwell is on the stricken list and will eventually be <b>disposed</b> of <b>upon</b> the end of her use as a test and training platform.|$|R

6000|$|... [p.296] huge wooden box, like a seaman's chest, {{occupies}} {{one of the}} corners. In {{the southern}} wall there is a Suffah, or little shelf of common stone, sunk under a single arch; upon this are placed articles in hourly use, perfume-bottles, coffee-cups, a stray book or two, and sometimes a turband, {{to be out of}} the children's way. Two hooks on the western wall, hung jealously high up, hold a pair of pistols with handsome crimson cords and tassels, and half a dozen cherry-stick pipes. The centre of the room is never without one or more Shishas[FN#16] (water pipes), and in the corner is a large copper brazier containing fire, with all the utensils for making coffee either <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> its broad brim or lying about the floor. The passage, like the stairs, is spread over with hard black earth, and is regularly watered twice a day during the hot weather.|$|E
60|$|The {{delight of}} the Nobility and Gentry and the patronised of Royalty had, by some process of self-abridgment {{known only to}} herself, got into her {{travelling}} bed, where she was snoring peacefully, while the large bonnet, carefully <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the drum, was revealing its glories {{by the light of}} a dim lamp that swung from the roof. The child's bed was already made upon the floor, {{and it was a great}} comfort to her to hear the steps removed as soon as she had entered, and to know that all easy communication between persons outside and the brass knocker was by this means effectually prevented. Certain guttural sounds, too, which from time to time ascended through the floor of the caravan, and a rustling of straw in the same direction, apprised her that the driver was couched upon the ground beneath, and gave her an additional feeling of security.|$|E
6000|$|... {{experiment}} {{had been}} tried, Guide Manoel {{pointed out the}} place where stood the tormentos, as he called the instruments. Thence we toiled afoot up the Mal Pais. This 'bad country' is contradictorily described by travellers. Glas (A.D. 1761) makes it a sheet of rock cracked cross-wise into cubes. Humboldt (1799) says, 'The lava, broken into sharp pieces, leaves hollows in which we risked falling up to our waists.' Von Buch (1815) mentions 'the sharp edges of glassy obsidian, as dangerous as the blades of knives.' Wilde (1857) tamely paints the scene as a 'magnified rough-cast.' Prof. Piazzi Smyth is, as usual, exact, but he suggests more difficulty than the traveller finds. I saw nothing beyond a succession of ridge-backs and shrinkage-crevasses, <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> an acute angle. These ragged, angular, and mostly cuboidal blocks, resembling the ice-pack of St. Lawrence River, have apparently been borne down by subsequent lava-currents, which, however, lacked impetus to reach {{the lower levels of}} Las Cañádas.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand--thou wouldst {{have this}} Ramorny, who hath been thought the {{instrument}} of my son's follies, exiled from court," [...] said the relieved monarch, [...] "until these unhappy scandals are forgotten, and our subjects are <b>disposed</b> to look <b>upon</b> our son with different and more confiding eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Walters was {{at first}} <b>disposed</b> to look <b>upon</b> it as a [...] "yarn;" [...] but the {{souvenir}} which Jake carried on his face was evidence {{that could not be}} doubted, and Cummings soon convinced the skeptical sailing master that the Chan Santa Cruz really had an existence.|$|R
60|$|Benham {{was rather}} still and stiff during the meal, but it ill becomes an English aristocrat {{to discuss the}} manners of an alien population, and Amanda was amused by the {{effusion}} of the landlord and a little <b>disposed</b> to experiment <b>upon</b> him. She sat radiating light amidst the shadows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{attention}} is next engaged by the wonderful arrangement and [...] curving of the minute furrows {{connected with the}} organ of touch[4] on [...] the inner surfaces of the hand and foot, especially on the last [...] phalanx of each finger. Some general account of them is always to be [...] found in every manual of physiology and anatomy, but in an organ of [...] such importance as the human hand, used {{as it is for}} very varied [...] movements, and especially serviceable to the sense of touch, no [...] research, however minute, can fail in yielding some gratifying [...] addition to our knowledge of that organ. After numberless [...] observations, I have thus far met with nine principal varieties of [...] curvature according to which the tactile furrows are <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> the [...] inner surface of the last phalanx of the fingers. I will describe them [...] concisely, and refer to the diagrams for further explanation (see [...] Plate 12, Fig. 19).|$|E
60|$|The {{artificial}} or portable box-sluice is {{a series}} of troughs each about twelve feet long, like the upper compartment of 'Long Tom.' They are made of half-inch boards, rough from the saw, the lower end being smaller to fit into its prolongation. Each compartment is provided with a loose metal bottom pierced with holes to admit the dust; the true bottom below it has cross-riffles, and above it are bars or gratings to catch the coarser stones. These sluices are mounted on trestles, and the latter are <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> a slope determined by the quantity of water: the average fall or grade may be 1 to 50. In Australia four men filling a 'Long Tom,' or raised box-sluice, will remove and wash twenty-four cubic yards of ground per day. When the ore is fine, mercury may be dropped into {{the upper end of the}} sluice; and it picks up the particles, 'tailing,' as it goes, before the two metals have run far down. Both stop at the first riffle or resting-place.|$|E
60|$|As I grew older, my skirts grew longer, {{my desire}} for {{independence}} sharper, and my wits more inquiring. On my seventeenth birthday I put up my hair, and {{was confirmed by}} a bishop whom my godmother persuaded to officiate in the house. It was a solemn occasion; but {{my mother was a}} good deal concerned about the lunch, and I with the ballooning lawn sleeves and the two square episcopal finger-tips <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> my head. The experience cast a peaceful light into my mind and shook my heart, but it made me for a time a little self-conscious of both my virtue and my sins. I began to brood not only on the deplorable state of my own soul, but also on Pollie's and Mrs Ballard's, and became for a time a diminutive Miss Fenne. I suppose innocence is a precarious bliss. On the other hand, if one's mind is like a dead mole's belly, it is wise, I think, to examine it closely but not too often, and to repeat that confirmation for one's self every morning and evening.|$|E
60|$|The {{king was}} much grieved {{when he heard}} {{of the death of}} Artevelde, and held a council with his chief leaders.

60|$|Mr. Bucket {{eyed the}} old man for a moment--he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle--as if he were much <b>disposed</b> to pounce <b>upon</b> him; nevertheless, he {{continued}} to bend over him with the same agreeable air, keeping the corner {{of one of his}} eyes upon us.|$|R
2500|$|... 30 December: Stephen Dean Holmes, 14. Last seen on his {{way home}} from a rock concert; Holmes {{encountered}} Nilsen in the Cricklewood Arms on the evening of 29 December before accepting an offer to drink alcohol with him at Melrose Avenue. The following morning, Nilsen strangled Holmes with a necktie until he was unconscious, before drowning him in a bucket of water. His body was to remain beneath Nilsen's floorboards for over seven months before being <b>disposed</b> of <b>upon</b> a bonfire, and Holmes was the only victim not to have been dissected before disposal. Holmes' remains would not be identified until November 2006.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was delighted}} with the country, a {{counterpart}} of the Usumbara Hills in Eastern Africa, <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> nearly the same parallel. The Cacimbo season corresponded with the Harmattan north of the Line; still, grey mornings, and covered, rainless noons, so distasteful to the Expedition, which complained that, from four to five days together, it could not obtain an altitude. The curious contrast in a region of evergreens was not wanting, the varied tintage of winter on one tree, and upon another the brightest hues of budding spring. The fair land of grass and flowers [...] "rough but beautiful," [...] of shrubbery-path, and dense mottes or copse islets, with clear fountains bubbling from the rocks, adorned by noble glimpses of the lake-like river, and of a blue horizon, which suggested the ocean--ever {{one of the most}} attractive points in an African landscape,--was easily invested by the eye of fancy with gold and emerald and steely azure from above, whilst the blue masses of bare mountain, thrown against a cloudless sky, towered over the black-green sea of vegetation at their base, like icebergs rising from the bosom of the Atlantic.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a symptom," [...] he said, [...] "of {{approaching}} danger, {{when such}} men, as were not usually {{influenced by the}} vanities of life employed much money in ornaments composed of the precious metals. It {{was a sign that}} the merchant could not obtain a profit for the capital, which, for the sake of security, he invested in this inert form. It was a proof that the noblemen or gentlemen feared the rapacity of power, when they put their wealth into forms the most portable and the most capable of being hidden; and it showed the uncertainty of credit, when a man of judgment preferred the actual possession of a mass of a silver to the convenience of a goldsmith's or a banker's receipt. While a shadow of liberty remained," [...] he said, [...] "domestic rights were last invaded; and, therefore, men <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> their cupboards and tables the wealth which in these places would remain longest, though not perhaps finally, sacred from the grasp of a tyrannical government. But let there be a demand for capital to support a profitable commerce, and the mass is at once consigned to the furnace, and, ceasing to be a vain and cumbrous ornament of the banquet, becomes a potent and active agent for furthering the prosperity of the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|Resuming our ride, we dismounted, {{after four}} miles, at the half-way Mahattah ("halting-place"): it is a rond-point in the Wady Sadr, marked from afar by a tall blue pyramid, the Jebel el-Ga'lah (Jálah). We {{spent some time}} {{examining}} this interesting bulge. Here the Jibál el-Tihámah end, and the eastern parallel range, the Jibál el-Shafah, begins. The former belong to the Huwaytát and to Egypt; the latter, partly to the Ma'ázah and to Syria. The geographical frontier is well marked by two large watercourses <b>disposed</b> <b>upon</b> a meridian, and both feeding the main drain, the Sadr-Tiryam. To the north the Wady Sawádah divides the granitic Harb from the porphyritic Jebel Sawádah; while the southern Wady Aylán separates the Dibbagh from the Jebel Aylán, a tall form distinctly visible from the Upper Shárr. The rest of our eastward march will now be through the Shafah massif. It resembles on a lower scale the Tihámah Gháts; but it wholly wants their variety, their beauty, and their grandeur. The granites which before pierced the porphyritic traps in all directions, now appear only at intervals; and this, I am told, is the case throughout the northern, as we {{found it to be}} in the southern, prolongation of the [...] "Lip"-range. At the same time there is no distinct geographical separation between the two parallels; and both appear, not as if parted by neutral ground, but rather as topographical continuations of each other.|$|E

"'We {{left this}} kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to another, {{where we were}} {{astonished}} to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads.
