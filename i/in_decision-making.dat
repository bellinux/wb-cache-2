He took control of The Churchill Machine Tool Co and, with Maginness as managing director, in December of that year embarked on a scheme to expand production and replace obsolete machinery, some of it over 20 years old, {{in an attempt to}} achieve an average output figure of £40,000 per month. However, there were difficulties <b>in</b> <b>decision-making</b> and wariness as the clouds of war loomed, most notably because of the company's contracts to supply a needy Soviet Union with machine tools, which had done much to assist it out of the depths of depression.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests <b>in</b> <b>decision-making</b> procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place within the party. The role of the Central Committee <b>in</b> <b>decision-making</b> was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened. The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E

Based on the Management Accounting researched by Dawne Lamminmaki (2008), with two dependent variables and three independent variables. Using survey questionnaire from managers and three supervisor from each branch office units in PT PLN (Persero) APJ Tegal and regression-path analysis in SPSS 16.

Findings {{support the view that}} intuition plays an important role <b>in</b> sponsorship <b>decision-making.</b> Support is also provided for the expectation that sponsorship <b>decision-making</b> <b>in</b> large organisations with more formalised decision-making processes is less intuitively based. Furthermore, organisations that place high importance on a trusting relationship when entering into a sponsorship arrangement use relatively high levels of intuition. An association was also found between three aspects of risk exposure and the use of intuition <b>in</b> sponsorship <b>decision-making.</b> This study advances our {{understanding of the nature of}} the role of intuition <b>in</b> sponsorship <b>decision-making.</b> The importance of intuition <b>in</b> sponsorship <b>decision-making</b> has been examined <b>in</b> the investment <b>decision-making</b> literature but not the sponsorship literature, and with recent calls for greater use of formalised analytical procedures <b>in</b> sponsorship <b>decision-making,</b> it appears there is considerable potential for decision-makers in the sponsorship area to draw on points of focus raised in this study...|$|R

25|$|Actual bias is the {{influence}} of partiality and prejudice <b>in</b> <b>decision-making,</b> and actual prejudice against or in favour of a party. It must be proved on a balance of probabilities. However, it is understandably difficult to obtain evidence of actual bias.

40|$|Although {{decision-making}} {{is typically}} {{seen as a}} rational process, emotions {{play a role in}} tasks that include unfairness. Recently, activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during offers experienced as unfair in the Ultimatum Game was suggested to subserve goal maintenance in this task. This is restricted to correlational evidence, however, and it remains unclear whether the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is crucial for strategic decision-making. The present study used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in order to investigate the causal role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex <b>in</b> strategic <b>decision-making</b> <b>in</b> the Ultimatum Game. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex resulted <b>in</b> an altered <b>decision-making</b> strategy compared with sham stimulation.

40|$|Background: Patients’ {{involvement}} <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making</b> {{is crucial}} to provide good quality of care that is respectful of, and responsive to, patients’ preferences, needs and values. Whether {{people want to be}} involved <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making</b> is associated with individual patient characteristics, and health status. However, the observation of differences in whether people want to be involved does not in itself provide an explanation. Insight is necessary into mechanisms that explain people’s involvement. This study aims to examine one mechanism, namely social norms. We make a distinction between subjective norms, that is doing what others think one ought to do, and descriptive norms, doing what others do. We focus on self-reported involvement <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making.</b> Methods: A questionnaire was sent to members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel in May 2015 (response 46 %; N = 974). A regression model was used to estimate the relationship between socio-demographics, social norms and involvement <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making.</b> Results: <b>In</b> line with our hypotheses, we observed that the more conservative social norms are, the less people are involved <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making.</b> The effects for both types of norms were comparable. Conclusion: This study indicates that social norms play a role as a mechanism to explain involvement <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making.</b> Our study offers a first insight into the possibility that the decision to be involved <b>in</b> medical <b>decision-making</b> is not as individual as it at first seems; someone’s social context also plays a role. Strategies aimed at emphasizing patient involvement have to address this social context. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

25|$|Cannabis is a {{commonly}} used recreational drug {{derived from the}} plant Cannabis sativa. The drug targets {{the central nervous system}} and is associated with cognitive impairments such as deficits <b>in</b> <b>decision-making,</b> learning, and speed of processing. The most consistently reported deficit among users is related to memory performance. A study by Bartholomew et al. (2010) was conducted using the PRMQ and a video-based prospective memory task to test cannabis users and non-users. Cannabis users performed significantly worse on both the PRMQ and the video-based prospective memory task, suggesting that cannabis negatively affects prospective memory.|$|E
