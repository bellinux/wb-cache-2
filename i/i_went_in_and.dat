I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Tostes responded to a 1994 press query about Caymmi's habit of frequenting bars with a short story: [...] "One night I went to look for him in a bar ... He was {{surrounded}} by women. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing. I thought he was involved with drugs, but it wasn't the case. He was with the tramps." [...] Despite such incidents, however, they remained together for 68 years, {{until his death in}} 2008.

[...] Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see {{the structure of the}} song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done.

So yeah, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me."
