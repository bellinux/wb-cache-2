5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained.

The generals were correct.|$|E

That is, forward-looking agents are more uncertain about the future development of output, unemployment, and inflation when {{the growth rate of}} output is expected to fall, and they are less uncertain when this growth rate is <b>expected</b> to increase. <b>The</b> findings indicate that macroeconomic polices would have asymmetric effects on output depending upon how economic agents <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> economy to perform in the near futureMacroeconomic uncertainty, expectations, expected macroeconomic performance...|$|R
