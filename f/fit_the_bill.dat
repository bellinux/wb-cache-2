5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Gable's {{arrival in}} Hollywood {{occurred}} fortuitously. MGM {{was looking to}} expand its stable of male stars and he <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> He first worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain. He made two pictures in 1931 with Wallace Beery, a supporting role in The Secret Six, then with his part increasing in size to almost match Beery's in the naval aviation film Hell Divers. MGM's publicity manager Howard Strickling developed Gable's studio image, playing up his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona.|$|E
25|$|Fouts's {{first few}} years in the league were inauspicious, but {{with the arrival of}} head coach Don Coryell in 1978 the Chargers' {{fortunes}} turned. Yet it was two years earlier, with the arrival of Bill Walsh as the Chargers' offensive coordinator, that the seeds of success were planted. Under Coryell, the Chargers were known as Air Coryell for the deep passing game and the involvement of the tight end as a key receiver. This required a tough, intelligent quarterback with a strong arm. Fouts <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E

25|$|Avery {{signed a}} four-year, $15.5 million {{contract}} with the Dallas Stars on July 2, 2008. He had been a roommate of the Stars' co-general manager Brett Hull when the two played for the Red Wings. Hull thought the Stars needed more fire and emotion on the ice, and felt Avery would <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Avery scored 3 goals in 23 games before he and the team parted ways following his six-game suspension by the NHL in December 2008, due to controversial remarks made about fellow players. The Stars placed Avery on waivers on February 7, 2009.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an [...] "accent", who {{would be willing to}} do scuba diving, and was a half Indian and half Caucasian girl. A lot of girls were auditioned for it in New York and London. Later, in a party, she met Katrina Kaif, and chose her. Her role was {{reportedly}} described as [...] "a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature." [...] Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki ever since seeing her in Dev D and That Girl in Yellow Boots.

That afternoon, Parsons met with Groves, who quickly sized him up as the right man for the job.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the rest}} of the City of Burnside, Hazelwood Park's {{political}} leanings are overwhelmingly in favour of the Liberal Party.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low marks, warning that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll be stuck with an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from GamePro, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that [...] "if you're looking for some classic shooter action on your new GBA, Iridion 3D will <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> nicely without blowing you away." ...|$|E

2500|$|For 1974, the Chevrolet Nova got larger {{parking lights}} and new bow-tie grille emblems, {{as well as}} {{modified}} bumpers that added two inches to length and helped cushion minor impacts.

Nova sales continued the surge they had enjoyed since 1972 and approached 400,000 cars for 1974. Six-cylinder Novas were the fastest gainers, as sales of V-8 Novas declined.

2500|$|Of the 16 {{members of}} Qasim's cabinet, 12 were Ba'ath Party members; however, the party turned against Qasim {{due to his}} refusal to join Gamal Abdel Nasser's United Arab Republic. To {{strengthen}} his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party, which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism. Later that year, the Ba'ath Party leadership was planning to assassinate Qasim. Saddam was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba'ath Party {{was more of an}} ideological experiment than a strong anti-government fighting machine. The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> The choice of Saddam was, according to historian Con Coughlin, [...] "hardly surprising". The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser's, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in Damascus, which was then part of the UAR. However, [...] "no evidence has ever been produced to implicate Nasser directly in the plot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Forrest was {{an early}} member of the Ku Klux Klan ("KKK" [...] or [...] "the Klan") which was formed by {{veterans}} of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee in 1866 and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A common report is that Forrest arrived in Nashville in April 1867 while the Klan was meeting at the Maxwell House Hotel, probably at the encouragement of a state Klan leader, former Confederate general George Gordon. The organization had grown {{to the point where}} an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> In Room 10 of the Maxwell, Forrest was sworn in as a member by John W.
