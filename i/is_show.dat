What we're really trying to do <b>is</b> <b>show</b> the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story.

[...] Peter Watrous of The New York Times called it [...] "an essential pop album" [...] and stated, [...] "On their own, the lyrics seen functional. Taken with the music, they bloom with meaning." [...] Simon Reynolds of Melody Maker remarked that the content epitomizes the group's significance at the time: [...] "Public Enemy are important ... because of the angry questions that seethe in their music, in {{the very fabric of}} their sound; the bewilderment and rage that, in this case, have made for one hell of strong, scary album". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot felt that with the album, [...] "Public Enemy affirms that {{it is not just a}} great rap group, but one of the best rock bands on the planet-black or otherwise".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} footage of Frankie Sandford {{sitting in a}} tree; Mollie King <b>is</b> <b>show</b> riding a bike along a dustry road; while Vanessa White is leaning against {{the walls of a}} {{crumbling}} building; the camera flies past Rochelle Wiseman, who stands on the beach by the water's edge and Una Healy drives a convertible car along a dusty road. As the chorus plays for the first time, the cameras follow the girls as they respectively walk around their surroundings, bar Sandford who remains in the tree and White who does not move from her spot. In the verse following, King is sitting by the road side with her bike and Wiseman is seen sitting on the rocks near the water's edge. Then as the chorus breaks for the second time the girls are seen dancing a choreographed routine on a sandy beach. Each is wearing a flowing maxi dress (see image alongside). The interspliced scenes of Sandford walking through trees gained a mention in The Daily Mail. [...] "Sandford is seen wearing a cropped white top and white shorts, Frankie walks casually through a field in the video, seemingly unaware of the attention her astonishing six pack is receiving." [...] The song's bridge mainly focusses on footage of the girls at a beach party dancing to the DJ, while the final run of the chorus sees the camera rotate around the girls as they dance on the beach. There is a brief view of the seaside villas in the background. It ends by showing the footage from the scenes {{at the start of the}} video, showing each of the girls in turn.|$|E

Sinner, {{it is one thing to}} say, I fear God, and another to fear him indeed. Therefore, as James says, show me thy faith by thy works, so here God calls for a testimony of thy fear by the effects of fear. I have already showed you several effects of fear; if thou art a stranger to them, thou art a stranger to this grace of fear. Therefore, to conclude this, it is not a feigned profession that will do; nothing is good here, but what is salted with this fear of God, and they that fear him are men of truth, men of singleness of heart, perfect, upright, humble, holy men; wherefore, reader, examine, and again, I say examine, and lay the Word and thy heart together, before that thou concludest that thou fearest God.|$|E
60|$|The {{travelling}} {{career of}} the young Duke may be conceived {{by those who have}} wasted their time, and are compensated for that silliness by being called men of the world. He gamed a little at Paris; he ate a good deal at Vienna; and he studied the fine arts in Italy. In all places his homage to the fair sex was renowned. The Parisian duchess, the Austrian princess, and the Italian countess spoke in the most enthusiastic terms of the English nobility. At the end of three years the Duke of St. James was of opinion that he had obtained a great knowledge of mankind. He was mistaken; travel is not, as is imagined, the best school for that sort of science. Knowledge of mankind is a knowledge of their passions. The traveller is looked upon as a bird of passage, whose visit is short, and which the vanity of the visited wishes to make agreeable. All <b>is</b> <b>show,</b> all false, and all made up. Coterie succeeds coterie, equally smiling--the explosions take place in his absence. Even a grand passion, which teaches a man more, perhaps, than anything else, is not very easily excited by the traveller. The women know that, sooner or later, he must disappear; and though this is the case with all lovers, they do not like to miss the possibility of delusion. Thus the heroines keep in the background, and the visitor, who is always in a hurry, falls into the net of the first flirtation that offers.|$|E
