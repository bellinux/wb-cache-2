2500|$|Aside {{from his}} writing, Klein {{was also an}} {{important}} member of the Montreal Jewish community during his lifetime. By profession he was a lawyer, and spent many years as a consultant and speech writer for Samuel Bronfman, owner of the Seagram distillery. He was editor of the Canadian Jewish Chronicle from 1932 until 1955, a periodical to which he also contributed articles on such subjects as the rise of Nazism in Germany, the social position of Jews in Canada, and {{the founding of the}} state of Israel in 1948. Klein was a Zionist but his enthusiasm for the new Jewish state was tempered by a critical eye for political realities. This ambivalence toward Israel is best expressed in The Second Scroll, which [...] he wrote after a <b>fact-finding</b> <b>journey</b> to Israel in 1949 and published two years later. Also in 1949, Klein ran unsuccessfully for the Canadian Parliament {{as a member of the}} Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. Increasing mental illness in the following years led to a suicide attempt and hospitalisation in 1952. In 1956, he was awarded the Lorne Pierce Medal by the Royal Society of Canada, but by then he had lapsed into the mysterious silence that saw him give up writing altogether and become a recluse in his home in Montreal's Outremont district, until his death in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Oleskiw {{left for}} Canada along with Ivan Dorundiak, a {{representative}} of the farming community, on July 25, 1895 on a <b>fact-finding</b> <b>journey</b> that would span three months. Along the way, at length he met with Sir Charles Tupper, at that time Canada’s high commissioner in London. The correspondence between Oleskiw and the Canadian Government was conducted with the aid of the High Commissioner in London. Because of Oleskiw’s efforts, on the one hand, and the Canadian government’s direct involvement, on the other, the flow of Ukrainians to Canada was much more targeted and organized than that to the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Colonel Trichard's son Charles (C.J.) now {{considered}} the possibility of emigration to Madagascar, an area which had been explored years before by his grandfather Carolus. The Trichards were {{among a group of}} [...] "bittereinders" [...] (diehards) who attend a planning meeting in Ermelo on January 7, 1903, The six men who formed part of a delegation here for a Landseeking expedition to German East Africa to explore for settlement, had excluded the Trichards for the time being. Colonel Trichard however did join the dozen of the Great Commission, under the leadership of Piet C. Joubert, who departed from Lourenco Marques in May 1904. At Trichard's insistence, they visited Madagascar, which was also examined as a destination by the Reitz brothers and General Manie Maritz. They visited Tamatawe and Tananariwe, and received by Governor General Joseph Gallieni, who authorized them to undertake a <b>fact-finding</b> <b>journey.</b> After exploring the east coast, they decided against settling because of three reasons, namely the official status of the Catholic Church, endemic malaria and the strong oriental influences.|$|E

Patterson indicated that he had often thought, as he passed through the Philadelphia Mint's coining department, that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir Christopher Wren in London's St. Paul's Cathedral, Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice (if you seek his monument, look around you).|$|E
