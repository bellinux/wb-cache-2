40|$|The art of {{communication}} – listening and speaking – {{is a major}} life skill, with a thorough influence on every human life. Remaining silent while the interlocutor speaks {{is not all that}} there is to the act of listening to messages. True listening is based on an intention to get involved in understanding of the other person, enjoying his or <b>her</b> <b>presence,</b> <b>learning</b> something from the conversation, giving assistance, or comforting the interlocutor. In the article the author describes obstacles (barriers), which render true listening impossible. These barriers have been identified by a group of young adults. Ewa Jurczyk-Romanowsk...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an extension of}} an ongoing study of online learning framed within the community of inquiry (CoI) model (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2001) in which we further examine a new construct labeled as <b>learning</b> <b>presence.</b> We use <b>learning</b> <b>presence</b> {{to refer to the}} iterative processes of forethought and planning, monitoring and adapting strategies for learning, and reflecting on results that successful students use to regulate their learning in online, interactive environments. To gain insight into these processes, we present results of a study using quantitative content analysis (QCA) and social network analysis (SNA) in a complementary fashion. First, we used QCA to identify the forms of <b>learning</b> <b>presence</b> reflected in students’ public (class discussions) and more private (learning journals) products of knowledge construction in online, interactive components of a graduate-level blended course. Next, we used SNA to assess how the forms of <b>learning</b> <b>presence</b> we identified through QCA correlated with the network positions students held within those interactional spaces (i. e., discussions and journals). We found that the students who demonstrated better self- and co-regulation (i. e., <b>learning</b> <b>presence)</b> took up more advantageous positions in their knowledge-generating groups. Our results extend and confirm both the CoI framework and previous investigations of online learning using SNA...|$|R

40|$|E-portfolios {{constitute}} a dynamic research topic in e-learning, since they foster a new philosophy {{for learning and}} personal development, which is characterised by open, participatory, self-directed, reflective and collaborative processes. This paper presents an investigation on students’ <b>learning</b> <b>presence</b> in a blended post-graduate course, designed to promote self directed learning through e-portfolio activities. The theoretical foundations and the key dimensions of e-portfolio learning activities are outlined, i. e. students’ construction, reflection and collaboration. Following are presented the organizational and the analysis framework of students’ self-directed learning and constructive activities within the e-portfolio. Combining both, descriptive analysis and Social Network Analysis of the research data, we have revealed important information regarding individual performance and students’ <b>learning</b> <b>presence,</b> interaction and collaboration among participants {{as well as the}} overall operation of the e-portfolio community...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} online {{learning}} initiatives like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has significantly altered {{the landscape in}} eLearning. These initiatives may provide an abundant amount of learning resources for free, but {{it is up to}} the learner to find the right ones to meet <b>her</b> <b>learning</b> needs and aspirations. Today’s learner is expected to be able to plan <b>her</b> <b>learning</b> journey, search for appropriate learning resources, use these resources for <b>her</b> <b>learning</b> and reflect on her progress. In other words, a self-regulation skill set is required that will enable someone to learn how to learn. This book provides an introduction to the new learning technologies that empower self-regulated learning and personal learning environments. A selection of learning tools that will help you build your personal learning environment and become a self-regulated learner are also demonstrated. You will have an opportunity to try these tools through a set of interactive learning activities included in this book...|$|R
