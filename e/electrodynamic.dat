5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical <b>electrodynamic</b> levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum <b>electrodynamic</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that <b>electrodynamic</b> effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne dust cloud could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

25|$|These trains use superconducting magnets, {{which allow}} for a larger gap, and repulsive/attractive-type <b>electrodynamic</b> {{suspension}} (EDS). In comparison Transrapid uses conventional electromagnets and attractive-type electromagnetic suspension (EMS).|$|E
25|$|Other {{proposals}} for solar spacecraft include {{solar thermal heating}} of propellant, typically hydrogen or sometimes water is proposed. An <b>electrodynamic</b> tether {{can be used to}} change a satellite's orientation or adjust its orbit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrodynamic</b> {{assistance}} to launch rockets has been studied. Space applications {{of this technology}} would likely involve specially formed electromagnetic coils and superconducting magnets. Composite materials would likely be used for this application.|$|E
25|$|The {{open system}} <b>electrodynamic</b> tether, which uses the ionosphere, is being researched. The space tether uses plasma {{contactors}} and the ionosphere {{as parts of}} a circuit to extract energy from the Earth's magnetic field by electromagnetic induction.|$|E
25|$|An {{electrically}} powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel spacecraft in outer space, most systems being based on electrically powering propellant to high speed, with some systems being based on <b>electrodynamic</b> tethers principles of propulsion to the magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrodynamic</b> {{suspension}} (EDS) uses superconducting electromagnets or strong {{permanent magnets}} {{that create a}} magnetic field, which induces currents in nearby metallic conductors when there is relative movement, which pushes and pulls the train towards the designed levitation position on the guide way.|$|E
25|$|Individual <b>electrodynamic</b> drivers {{provide their}} best {{performance}} within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three {{most commonly used}} sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of conservation of mass (which he called Lavoisier's principle) — {{the consideration of}} movements at a speed close to that of light posed a problem for this principle; this is again an <b>electrodynamic</b> problem : the mass of a body {{in such a state}} of motion is not constant.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} {{transducers}} include variable-reluctance (or moving-armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on {{the surfaces of}} gaps, and moving coil (or <b>electrodynamic)</b> transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic violins may be {{used with}} an add-on {{piezoelectric}} bridge or body pickup, or a magnetic pickup attached to the fingerboard end. Alternatively, an <b>electrodynamic</b> pickup can be installed under an acoustic violin's fingerboard avoiding interference with any tone-producing parts of the violin, and therefore keeping its acoustic resonances and tone intact.|$|E
25|$|Electric violins may use {{magnetic}}, piezoelectric, or <b>electrodynamic</b> pickups. Guitar/coil type magnetic pickups {{require the}} use of violin strings that have ferrous (iron-containing, as in steel) metal wraps or cores. A few single-coil guitar-style magnetic systems are available, The small body size and arced string arrangement of a violin limit the amount of space available for coil placement.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, while delayed {{in traffic}} on the Throgs Neck Bridge, James Powell, a {{researcher}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), thought of using magnetically levitated transportation. Powell and BNL colleague Gordon Danby worked out a MagLev concept using static magnets mounted on a moving vehicle to induce <b>electrodynamic</b> lifting and stabilizing forces in specially shaped loops, such as figure of 8 coils on a guideway.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory was}} framed {{in terms of}} {{kinematics}} (the study of moving bodies), and showed how quantification of distances and times varied for measurements made in different reference frames. His theory was a breakthrough advance over Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena and Poincaré's <b>electrodynamic</b> theory. Although these theories included equations identical to those that Einstein introduced (i.e. the Lorentz transformation), they were essentially adhoc models proposed to explain the results of various experiments—including the famous Michelson–Morley interferometer experiment—that were extremely difficult to fit into existing paradigms.|$|E
25|$|For duplex transmission, i.e. sending and {{receiving}} in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed {{starting with the}} work of C. F. Varley for telegraphic transmission. Duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when H. E. Shreeve of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company improved existing attempts at constructing a telephone repeater consisting of back-to-back carbon-granule transmitter and <b>electrodynamic</b> receiver pairs. The Shreeve repeater was first tested on a line between Boston and Amesbury, MA, and more refined devices remained in service for some time.|$|E
25|$|The {{commitment}} made selecting one {{or another}} ontology can produce a sharply different view of the task at hand. Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the <b>electrodynamic</b> view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E
25|$|Hydro-Québec {{has been}} criticized for not having taken {{advantage}} of some of its innovations. An electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with Quebecers, first prototyped in 1994 by Pierre Couture, an engineer and physicist working at IREQ, is one of these. The heir to the Couture wheel motor is now marketed by TM4 <b>Electrodynamic</b> Systems, a spin-off established in 1998 that has made deals with France's Dassault and Heuliez to develop an electric car, the Cleanova, of which prototypes were built in 2006. Hydro-Québec announced in early 2009 at the Montreal International Auto Show that its engine had been chosen by Tata Motors to equip a demonstration version of its Indica model, which will be road tested in Norway.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{nuclear power}} plant was {{commissioned}} on June 27, 1954 in Obninsk. Soviet scientists made a major contribution {{to the development of}} computer technology. The first major achievements in the field were associated with the building of analog computers. In the USSR, principles for the construction of network analysers were developed by S. Gershgorin in 1927 and the concept of the <b>electrodynamic</b> analog computer was proposed by N. Minorsky in 1936. In the 1940s, the development of AC electronic antiaircraft directors and the first vacuum-tube integrators was begun by L. Gutenmakher. In the 1960s, important developments in modern computer equipment were the BESM-6 system built under the direction of S. A. Lebedev, the MIR series of small digital computers, and the Minsk series of digital computers developed by G.Lopato and V. Przhyalkovsky.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} and experiment have both shown that periodically arrayed conducting elements (non-magnetic by nature) respond predominantly to the magnetic component of incident electromagnetic fields. The {{result is an}} effective medium and negative μeff over a band of frequencies. The permeability was verified to be {{the region of the}} forbidden band, where the gap in propagation occurred – from a finite section of material. This was combined with a negative permittivity material, εeff < 0, to form a “left-handed” medium, which formed a propagation band with negative group velocity where previously there was only attenuation. This validated predictions. In addition, a later work determined that this first metamaterial had a range of frequencies over which the refractive index was predicted to be negative for one direction of propagation (see ref #). Other predicted <b>electrodynamic</b> effects were to be investigated in other research.|$|E
25|$|Another way of {{deriving}} {{some sort}} of electromagnetic mass {{was based on the}} concept of radiation pressure. These pressures or tensions in the electromagnetic field were derived by James Clerk Maxwell (1874) and Adolfo Bartoli (1876). Lorentz recognized in 1895 that those tensions also arise in his theory of the stationary aether. So if the electromagnetic field of the aether is able to set bodies in motion, the action/reaction principle demands that the aether must be set in motion by matter as well. However, Lorentz pointed out that any tension in the aether requires the mobility of the aether parts, which in not possible since in his theory the aether is immobile. This represents a violation of the reaction principle that was accepted by Lorentz consciously. He continued by saying, that one can only speak about fictitious tensions, since they are only mathematical models in his theory to ease the description of the <b>electrodynamic</b> interactions.|$|E
25|$|In <b>electrodynamic</b> {{suspension}} (EDS), {{both the}} guideway {{and the train}} exert a magnetic field, and the train is levitated by the repulsive and attractive force between these magnetic fields. In some configurations, the train can be levitated only by repulsive force. In {{the early stages of}} maglev development at the Miyazaki test track, a purely repulsive system was used instead of the later repulsive and attractive EDS system. The magnetic field is produced either by superconducting magnets (as in JR–Maglev) or by an array of permanent magnets (as in Inductrack). The repulsive and attractive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in wires or other conducting strips in the track. A major advantage of EDS maglev systems is that they are dynamically stable – changes in distance between the track and the magnets creates strong forces to return the system to its original position. In addition, the attractive force varies in the opposite manner, providing the same adjustment effects. No active feedback control is needed.|$|E
25|$|Among Tom Ligon's many {{short and}} {{medium-sized}} works (and one award-winning science fact {{article published in}} relation to Fusion rocket technology and advocate of Inertial <b>Electrodynamic</b> Fusion), two published in 1986 and 1993, The Devil and the Deep Black Void, and The Gardener in Analog Magazine, are science fiction stories which are about a Shi'a Muslim terrorist organization in a largely Muslim space-faring civilization where Bahá'ís are space colonists who undertake terraforming on a planet they named Mazra'ih (though there is brief mention of a United States National Spiritual Assembly back on Earth.) The prequel, For a Little Price about how terrorists are prevented from crashing a spaceship into the Earth (long predating {{the events of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks) was anthologized in 2008 though work began on it in 1986. In the succeeding stories some of the terrorists are instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a neutron star where Bahá'ís live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by a periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration reach some new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space. The ethical conflict of pacifism, a debatable stance associated with the Bahá'í Faith, in the face of terrorists is worked out. One character, who takes on the name of the historical Bábí who performed an assassination attempt on the life of the Shah of Iran, chooses the path of violence in defense of the population by way (as portrayed) of matching a strength of the Bahá'í Faith in acceptance of science compared to a weakness of Shia Islam of superstition.|$|E
500|$|The first paper {{seemed to}} point out a contradiction between the <b>electrodynamic</b> theory and the {{relativistic}} one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c2. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper [...] "Concerning a contradiction between <b>electrodynamic</b> and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass" [...] in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal Physikalische Zeitschrift in 1922. That year, Fermi submitted his article [...] "On the phenomena occurring near a world line" [...] (...) to the Italian journal I Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei. In this article he examined the Principle of Equivalence, and introduced the so-called [...] "Fermi coordinates". He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves {{as if it were}} a Euclidean space.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{apparently}} unknown to Lorentz that Joseph Larmor had used identical transformations to describe orbiting electrons in 1897. Larmor's and Lorentz's equations look somewhat dissimilar, {{but they are}} algebraically equivalent to those presented by Poincaré and Einstein in 1905. Lorentz's 1904 paper includes the covariant formulation of electrodynamics, in which <b>electrodynamic</b> phenomena in different reference frames are described by identical equations with well defined transformation properties. [...] The paper clearly recognizes {{the significance of this}} formulation, namely that the outcomes of <b>electrodynamic</b> experiments do not depend on the relative motion of the reference frame.

2500|$|The {{existence}} of negative refractive materials {{can result in}} a change in <b>electrodynamic</b> calculations for the case of permeability [...] μ = 1 [...] [...] A change [...] from a conventional refractive index to a negative value gives incorrect results for conventional calculations, because some properties and effects have been altered. When permeability [...] μ has values other than 1 this affects Snell's law, the Doppler effect, the Cherenkov radiation, Fresnel's equations, and Fermat's principle.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1905 (published in January 1906) Poincaré {{showed in}} detail how the transformations and <b>electrodynamic</b> {{equations}} are {{a consequence of}} the principle of least action; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination [...] is invariant. He noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing [...] as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors.|$|E
2500|$|Modern driver magnets {{are almost}} always {{permanent}} and made of ceramic, ferrite, Alnico, or, more recently, rare earth such as neodymium and samarium cobalt. <b>Electrodynamic</b> drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s; [...] there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — {{is the use of}} the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce <b>electrodynamic</b> loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils, as was common in the earliest designs; [...] one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by [...] "recharging" [...] the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.|$|E

In addition, the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace intended to measure some consequences of length contraction in the laboratory frame, for example the assumption that it would lead to birefringence. Though all of those experiments led to negative results. (The Trouton–Rankine experiment conducted in 1908 also gave a negative result when measuring the influence of length contraction on an electromagnetic coil.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Over time, fidelity, {{dynamic and}} noise levels {{improved}} {{to the point}} that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version. This was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic pickup cartridge by General Electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems.

2500|$|The major {{advantage}} to suspended maglev systems {{is that they}} work at all speeds, unlike <b>electrodynamic</b> systems, which only work at a minimum speed of about [...] This {{eliminates the need for}} a separate low-speed suspension system, and can simplify track layout. On the downside, the dynamic instability demands fine track tolerances, which can offset this advantage. Eric Laithwaite was concerned that to meet required tolerances, the gap between magnets and rail would have to be increased {{to the point where the}} magnets would be unreasonably large. In practice, this problem was addressed through improved feedback systems, which support the required tolerances.|$|E
