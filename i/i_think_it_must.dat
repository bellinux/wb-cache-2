500|$|The Monster {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Before its publication, Crane's friend Joseph Conrad wrote while {{responding to a}} partial draft: [...] "the damned story has been haunting me... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be fine." [...] William Dean Howells, an early champion of Crane, proclaimed the novella to be [...] "the greatest short story ever written by an American". [...] The Spectator concluded that The Monster alone would have cemented Crane's literary reputation; its reviewer wrote, [...] "If Mr. Crane had never written anything else, he would have earned the right of remembrance by this story alone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I am now {{thirty miles}} above Lawrence on the Kansas River {{assisting}} in {{starting a new}} town. We are just about in the central portion of the [...] "settled" [...] Territory and with perhaps the best landing and the most eligible site for a city in the entire country. ... So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be, {{and in a few}} years when civilization by its magic influence shall have transformed this glorious country from what it is now to the brilliant destiny awaiting it, the Sun in all his course will visit no land more truly lovely and desirable than this. Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> {{have been}} the final and terrible anxiety that tipped the beam with Phillips, for he {{suddenly}} slipped down, sitting in the water, and though we held his head up, he never recovered. I insisted on taking him into the lifeboat with us, hoping there still might be life, {{but it was too}} late." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} {{that it was}} a beautiful one. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been as much as seven feet high.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you believe}} it I hope that it is true; indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be true, Mother dear," [...] said Isobel with a little sob.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{all sounds}} very interesting," [...] he remarked, [...] "but <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be deadly for you. Your father invents {{no end of}} {{wonderful}} things, doesn't he?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "They all {{aspired to}} be Ben. The resourcefulness of his mind, his {{vitality}} were so enormous. His knowledge. His talent and ambition. He could tear through things, and he tore through life. They'd see this prodigious output of Ben's, and they'd think, 'Oh, hell, I'm a bum.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been devastating. Ben did it to MacArthur, who died in time to save his reputation. And I'd hate to have been Herman , caught between Kaufman and Hecht." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{menswear}} designer, Kim Jones, remembers {{collaborating with}} Smalley: [...] "I remember shooting {{in an old}} Amish village with Luke during the winter— <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been 15 degrees. The model, Ambrose Olsen, was freezing and shaking in the cold— he later {{told me that he}} wouldn’t have done it for anyone else except Luke because he was such a great guy." [...] He continued, [...] "Luke cared so much about everything in his work that everyone involved wanted to make anything happen for him. He was such a great talent who was underestimated by many, but I’m sure future generations will appreciate everything he’s done." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 1994, Václav Havel {{was awarded}} the Philadelphia Liberty Medal. In his {{acceptance}} speech, he said: [...] "The idea {{of human rights and}} freedoms must {{be an integral part of}} any meaningful world order. Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Judging by {{its effect}} upon my brother, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be a most {{extraordinary}} one." [...] He snuggled {{down in his}} armchair. [...] "Now, Watson, let us have the facts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} having a few minutes' sleep your honor. And now, if you don't want me for a minute, I will run down and see about breakfast. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be nearly ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I {{shall have}} to leave the house in their charge when I go to her, you know, in Virginia. How many miles is it to Virginia, Martin? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be {{thousands}} of miles." ...|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. No; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be that I have {{to listen}} sometimes.|$|E
60|$|PICKERING [laughing] He did. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be {{regarded}} as her property, Mrs. Pearce.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, sir. I {{noticed it}} when we climbed up. The head has gone, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been struck with {{lightning}} last summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the way I look at <b>it.</b> But <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be disagreeable. He takes {{such a deal}} {{of trouble}} about it. I heard him going on to-day to some one as though his whole soul {{depended}} on it." ...|$|R
60|$|There was one incident, however, {{that stands}} out very clearly in my memory. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have {{happened}} about the February of this year, and I will tell it to you before I go any further.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{know what}} you mean," [...] he said; [...] "but really I haven't the faintest idea. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be at least that, within a hundred years or so; but nobody has kept track of them for so long, it's hard to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 37. I {{can hear}} the bells ringing or tolling, away down the river, the air is so still. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be the bells of Bonn.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be {{conceded that}} the {{position}} of the Australasian Day is unique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to hold that high place a long time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Jeremiah? Tea-time? I don't know what's come to me. But I {{got such}} a dreadful turn, Jeremiah, before I went--off a-dreaming, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, in short, Monsieur, now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it,</b> you <b>must</b> live somewhere? Do tell me where; {{and what}} {{establishment}} of servants do you keep?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lever's novels {{will not}} live long,--even if {{they may be}} said to be alive now,--because it is so. What was his manner of working I do not know, but <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been very quick, and that he never troubled himself on the subject, except when he was seated with a pen in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{answered}} with pride, [...] "that is, almost. At any rate I have shot eland, and an elephant, but no lions yet. I {{was following the}} spoor of a lion just now, but it got up between the rocks and bolted away before I could shoot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know. I {{have never}} seen it open before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been left unclosed by accident. We will see where it leads to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> {{have been}} your children. I {{found them in}} front of your house, and I asked them for you, without going to the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{instead of}} a nice dish of minnows--they had a roasted {{grasshopper}} with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been nasty! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is said, senhor. I {{have not}} seen him myself, and should not know him if I saw him, but from {{descriptions}} <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be he. <b>I</b> have a poor fellow--a peon--lying here just now, who has been robbed and nearly murdered by him. Come, {{he is in the}} next room; you can speak to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} the heavy play goes on," [...] Boldero said. [...] "None of your four or five guineas wagers there, fifties and {{hundreds}} are nearer the mark, and I have seen a thousand wagered many a time. It is exciting work even looking on, I can tell you; what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be for the players I cannot say, but <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be frightful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I'd let {{you know}} that I was sure of it. What became of it after it was made, that, you know, is quite another question. <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be in the house, and if so, search ought to be made. If they believe there is such a will, why don't they come and search more regularly? I shouldn't hinder them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} such a funny dream. I dreamed that a spirit came and kissed me. I did not see it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been my mother's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jennie," [...] said Rollo, after gazing {{about for}} some moments, almost bewildered, [...] "if this is {{any kind of}} meeting at all, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be a camp meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{instead of}} a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted {{grasshopper}} with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been nasty! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Through {{the pass}} I several times {{observed}} {{a small white}} and yellow flower in patches. I lost it as we advanced, and yet <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have followed the stream. If <b>it</b> be, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> but <b>I</b> did not observe it with much attention, the flower of the mountain arnica, I know a preparation from that shrub which has a marvellous action on the nervous system.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you really}} mean it, {{it would be}} a relief,' she admitted. 'Sometimes I'd give all the money I'm ever likely to make for someone to shriek my grievances at. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been so nice for the people in the old novels, when they used to say: [...] "Sit down and I will tell you the story of my life." [...] Mustn't it have been heavenly?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} well enough without <b>it,</b> Roger; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be of some use, else {{why is it that}} Oswald is so good at devising plans? Had I been in his place, when he heard the news of the harrying of Hiniltie, and the {{carrying}} off of Armstrong's daughters, I should never have thought of starting on such an adventure as he did." ...|$|R
