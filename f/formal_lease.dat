50|$|The {{evidence}} {{seems to}} favor Chambers's {{description of a}} close working relationship between himself and Hiss during the 1930s more than Hiss's account of a casual acquaintanceship. This included Hiss subletting his apartment to Chambers without a <b>formal</b> <b>lease,</b> Hiss giving Chambers use of his car without transferring the title, and evidence that Chambers was in the Hiss home in 1937, a year after Hiss said he broke off contact with Chambers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there were}} two tennis courts in the park's {{southeast}} corner by 1924, the Banksia Tennis Club did not take out a <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> until 1938, for one rood and 4.4 perches of land. The club also built a timber clubhouse before 1946. The Banksia Tennis Club surrendered its lease in 1989, due to the aging of its membership, and a car park and a half basketball court had replaced the tennis courts, their fences, and clubhouse, by 1993.|$|E

Major Thomas Mitchell travelled through the area in 1836 while undertaking an expedition of what was to become Victoria.

50|$|The L&CR {{continued}} to have ambitious plans, and it planned parliamentary authority in 1882 to lease the LLUC's railway, {{as well as the}} construction of a line to Liskeard. The proposal fell through, possibly due to the reality of lack of cash, but a <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> of the LLUC undertaking was made, effective from 27 February 1878. This evidently included control of the residual canal activity. This was ratified by a later Act of 28 July 1884.|$|E
50|$|The State of Connecticut {{granted a}} <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> to the Valley Railroad Company on June 1, 1970. This lease {{authorized}} {{the company to}} use the 22.679 mi of track for freight and passenger service; and on July 29, 1971 (100 {{years to the day}} of the first ceremonial run), after thousands of hours of mostly volunteer effort, the first train of the new Valley Railroad steamed from Essex to Deep River and has been steaming since then. The current president of the railroad is Kevin Dodd.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} terminal {{was moved}} to the Erie's Jersey City Terminal late in 1868, about six months before the Northern Railroad's <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> to the Erie. At that time the company had six locomotives, 21 passenger and baggage cars, and 30 freight cars. Not long after, a nominally separate company, the Nyack and Northern Railroad, built from Nyack south to meet the Northern at Sparkill, and from its opening in May 1870 Nyack became the northern terminal for most Northern Railroad trains. The Northern track was changed to standard gauge {{along with the rest of}} the Erie system in 1878.|$|E

40|$|The area of {{leased land}} in The Netherlands has {{decreased}} from roughly 50 % of all agricultural land in 1966 to about 27 % in 2005. In 1995, the Dutchgovernment introduced two {{new types of}} lease contracts {{in order to prevent}} the decline from continuing. The new types of lease contracts implied the possibility of transferring a smaller part of the bundle of property rights from landowner to tenant. However, the trend towards decreasing lease area did not stop. In 2007, a new reform was introduced implying, again, less restrictions on <b>formal</b> <b>leasing</b> (the so-called liberalised lease). According to contract theory, transferring fewer property rights from a landowner to a tenant-farmer will lead to an institutional change for land leasing. For policies regulating land leasing, it is therefore important to recognise the characteristics of contractual arrangements and the parties involved. In this paper we analyse contract choice using a Trivariate probit model and taking into account the type of landowner and farmer characteristics. Results show that an official contract {{is more likely to be}} chosen if public organisations are involved. In contrast, when farmers exchange land among themselves, they are more likely to use less explicit contracts in which trust and reputation play an important role for coordinatio...|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway {{began to}} examine the St. Lawrence and Ottawa as early 1881 and a <b>formal</b> 999-year <b>lease</b> was signed on 26 September 1884. The {{majority}} of the line became the Prescott Subdivision, with the original alignment between Chaudière Junction and the Sussex Street Station becoming the Sussex Street Subdivision. In January 1882, CP officials, including Van Horne, inspected the line and decided to switch away from the Sussex Street station to Broad Street, where CP was consolidating lines of the Canada Central Railway to Carleton Place and the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental lines to Montreal and Aylmer. The station became Ottawa West Station, and a large freight switching yard opened to the north along Nepean Bay on the LeBreton Flats.|$|R
50|$|After negotiation, Railtrack {{agreed to}} hand over the canal to the District Council for leisure use. The Stover Canal Society worked with the District Council to {{formulate}} a strategy for its restoration, and this {{led to the creation of}} a Charitable Trust, on which the District Council, other local authorities and the Canal Society are all represented. Control of the remains passed to the Trust in February 2010, when a <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> was signed. In 2013 the towpath was opened to public access; in 2014 the remains of a barge were excavated in Ventiford Basin and a new stretch of the granite tramway was discovered. As of 2016 work was continuing towards restoring it as an amenity.|$|E
50|$|Although gold {{production}} {{on the field}} peaked in 1899 at an impressive 337,000 ounces, {{it soon became clear}} that these grades did not continue at depth and by 1920 only one mine was still operational. People, businesses and even the more portable buildings moved away from the town. The store was sold to Selina Vicks in 1921. Her husband, Thomas Vicks, conducted a grocery store from the premises. From 1926 Burns Philp also had an agency there, eventually moving from the site around 1940 when they obtained premises in Stubley Street. Vicks grocery store closed about the same time and the property was sold in 1944 to Bartlams, who may have been occupying the building before this, though there is no <b>formal</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E

An August 1882 letter from the Lands Office in Mackay, to the Under Secretary of Lands, Brisbane, noted that it was a good wharfage site, and that Long [...] "has already incurred great expense in forming by embankment and drainage a long causeway (to carry a tramway) to this spot". A Special Lease, number 169, was granted in September 1882, for 14 years from 1 October 1882, and consisted of a 5-acre wedge of land, rental of £1 per acre per annum. However, the wharf site was not surveyed until February 1884, and a <b>formal</b> <b>Lease</b> for Special Purposes, under the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876, was issued in July 1884, for a period of 14 years from 1 September 1882.|$|E
40|$|In a {{knowledge}} economy, a fundamental tension {{exists between the}} incentivization of proprietorship, and the freedom of access to intellectual products that fuels further creativity. Institutional and disciplinary protectionism encounters its greatest challenges in the convergences of research targets and the increasingly athletic capabilities of communication media. Ultimately, the vast expenditure and low yield associated with certain R&D enterprises call for a more consolidated total effort. The Commons is a vehicle for synthesizing these considerations about a changing paradigm of research. It offers a physical framework for bridging discontinuity and intensifying exchange, {{as a catalyst for}} foregrounding ideas about collaboration. Adopting speculative laboratory space for bioscience research as a pilot program, the Commons is the product of the combined implementation of <b>formal</b> and <b>leasing</b> strategies to generate a hub of interfaces [...] -between the physical and the virtual, between research and learning, between disciplines and institutions, and between the site and its immediate physical environment and beyond...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInternational {{accounting}} harmonization {{represents a}} complex process that {{plays an important role}} in the accounting profession. This research provides a comparative analysis and the measurement of <b>formal</b> harmonization of <b>lease</b> accounting treatment proposed by two sets of accounting regulations: the Romanian legislation (the Ministry of Public Finance Order no. 3055 / 2009) and the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 17 Leases, both valid on 31. 12. 2011. In this respect, the research methodology is based on closely analysing the regulations mentioned above and determining the similarity and dissimilarity coefficients, in order to assess the progress of national accounting regulations in converging with the International Accounting Standard. This study provides statistical evidence that the level of convergence between the national and international accounting treatment for lease transactions achieved in 2011 is 22 % in terms of complexity and requirements imposed by the six criteria analysed in the research. In addition, by calculating the coefficients of similarity and dissimilarity for each criterion, the study demonstrates that the recognition of a financial lease is the criterion with the greatest similarity coefficients and the lease disclosure differs totally in the two regulations. This study contributes to the development of lease accounting and literature in the field, considering that it is a topic that is very much debated in the later years by the inclusion in the agendas of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of a joint project regarding accounting for these transactions...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong {{has been}} using the {{leasehold}} system of land management rather than freehold since its colonial era. This system controlled and presently still controls uses of leased land through leasehold conditions. Many leases granted decades ago thus require <b>formal</b> modifications to <b>lease</b> conditions to formalize proposed changes in land use, or to realize the actual present economic value of the land, or to reflect the current market demands. From a real options analysis perspective, these land use conversions and analysis of real options associated therewith are significantly more complex than typical stylized land development real options encountered in academic literature and research. There is thus considerable interest in obtaining empirical evidence {{of the performance of}} real options valuation in land development applications, where options associated with land development rights are substantially constrained due to regulatory influences. The aim of this research is to outline major factors in operationalizing academic real options research for practical application in a particular land market with significant regulatory constraints, and then test two propositions derived from academic real options literature using actual residential real estate development projects in Hong Kong which require leasehold land conversion under statutory planning and zoning regulations as source of data. Typically past land use conversions in Hong Kong required developers to acquire raw or other redevelopable land through private negotiations with initial land lease owners and to wait for public provision of infrastructure and services, before applying for formal and legal conversion from a lower to higher land use. Our study concentrates on the period between when land is acquired and when actual construction of the development starts, and as becomes clear, the regulatory framework that governs land development significantly narrows typical real options as perceived in academic land development literature...|$|R
5000|$|A {{tenancy at will}} is a tenancy which {{either the}} {{landlord}} or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable notice. Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period. It may last for many years, {{but it could be}} ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all. Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes. If there is no <b>formal</b> <b>lease,</b> the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists. In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for consideration. Under the modern common law, a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for cause, even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to [...] "at will" [...] tenancy subject to 30-days notice. Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed. The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.|$|E
5000|$|The Ascot Golf Club {{was founded}} in 1887 [...] It is the second oldest and the only Royal Golf Club in Berkshire.Originally golf was played on Ascot Heath within the {{confines}} of the Race Course and became a Royal Club by Royal Command of Queen Victoria in 1887. Hamilton was the president of this club \. The course was designed by J.H.Taylor who went on to design many courses in Europe. One of the earlier competitions was The Boys Amateur Championship which was played on The Heath in1921. The Trophy for this was presented to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club and is still played for annually. An early competitor in this tournament was a young Henry Cotton later to become Sir Henry.After all the years The Club had played on The Heath, it came as a great shock to receive a notice from The Ascot Authority on the 13 November 2000 to vacate The Heath. At this time it was a thriving Club with a waiting list for members and a very active social life. The Committee at the time decided to try to find an alternative location in discussions with The Authority but no progress could be made.The problem was that The Club had no <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> or agreement. The Chairman wrote to The Queen and an immediate response was forthcoming. Land was offered to the Club on the other side of the road in Sunninghill Park and plans to resite The Club started in earnest. Eventually the new Clubhouse opened in December 2004 but golf continued on The Heath until August 2005.Thanks to the efforts of a few there is still a Golf Club today. The New Clubhouse was opened by HRH Duke of York The Patron of The Club on23 May 2006 [...]The New course is ranked as the 18th best golf course in the county by the website Top 100 Golf Courses.|$|E
40|$|AbstractContracts are {{mechanisms}} {{for carrying out}} transactions. Leasing land is a voluntary transaction in which property rights — such as user and income rights — are transferred from landowners to tenants. The bundle of property rights transferred within a lease transaction varies {{with the type of}} contractual arrangement. Analysis shows that for the landowner the value of the bundle of property rights to land is determined by the type of lease contract. Landowners prefer lease contracts with as little regulation as possible. Lease regulation can be characterized as a ‘handbook’ for concluding lease contracts. However, reducing regulation requires a shift in co-ordination mechanisms from that of the handbook to that of the ‘invisible hand’ (prices) and ‘handshake’ (e. g., mutual adjustment). Making use of the handshake and price as co-ordination mechanisms implies that the importance of trust and reputation will increase for both tenant and landowner. In 2007, the Dutch government introduced two new types of <b>formal</b> <b>lease</b> that rely less on handbook co-ordination. Whether a more liberalized lease system will lead to a change in the area leased not only depends on landowners but also on tenants, because contracts are two-sided mechanisms...|$|E
