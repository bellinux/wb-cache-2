5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with a mouthful of air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> which cancels his flight.|$|E
5|$|Lola Visual Effects {{worked on}} 48 shots, {{including}} some animation to Bana and Nimoy. Bana required extensive {{damage to his}} teeth, which was significant enough to completely replace <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in some shots. Nimoy's mouth was reanimated in his first scene with Kirk following a rerecording session. The filmmakers had filmed Nimoy when he rerecorded his lines so they could rotoscope <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> into the film, even recreating the lighting conditions, but they realized they had to digitally recreate his lips because of the bouncing light created by the camp fire.|$|E

5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> When something is in <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E

To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under his foot. Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E

5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> causing the bridle to drop to his chest, but he kept running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E

5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E

The ship Naglfar, described in the Prose Edda as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring, and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a jötunn named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir's side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout {{the air and the}} sea.|$|E
