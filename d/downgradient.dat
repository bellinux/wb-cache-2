The CT plume extends from a grain elevator approximately 2, 500 feet (760 meters) <b>downgradient</b> where it discharges into a small creek; the highest concentrations of CT (2, 500 µg/L) are located near the source area. Chloroform (CF), chloromethane, and methylene chloride have also been identified in study area groundwater. Bench-scale testing was conducted using soil and groundwater collected from the study area to identify the preferred pilot test remedial technology – injection of Adventus EHC ™ across the plume width near the source area to form the TZ. EHC acts through in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) and combines controlled-release, fibrous organic carbon, and micro-scale zero-valent iron. Following injection of EHC into the aquifer, various physical, chemical, and microbiological processes combine to create strongly reducing conditions in situ that stimulate rapid dechlorination of CT and other chlorinated solvents. Groundwater sampling results as early as four months after installation of the TZ showed a 76 % and 88 % decline in CT concentration at monitoring wells located 70 and 140 feet (21 and 43 meters) <b>downgradient</b> of the TZ, respectively.
