500|$|Square had {{announced}} that Xenogears {{may not have}} {{come out in the}} United States due to [...] "sensitive religious issues". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of [...] "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said [...] "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.|$|E

2500|$|Reid's {{career was}} aided by his quick wit and {{entertaining}} oratory; he {{was described as}} being [...] "perhaps the best platform speaker in the Empire", both amusing and informing his audiences [...] "who flocked to his election meetings as to popular entertainment". In one particular incident his quick wit and affinity for humour were demonstrated when a heckler pointed to his ample paunch and exclaimed [...] "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> George?" [...] to which Reid replied: [...] "If it's a boy, I'll call it after myself. If it's a girl I'll call it Victoria. But if, as I strongly suspect, it's nothing but piss and wind, I'll name it after you." [...] His humour, however, was not universally appreciated. Alfred Deakin detested Reid, describing him as [...] "inordinately vain and resolutely selfish" [...] and their cold relationship would affect both their later careers.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the day of}} its premiere, James Montgomery of MTV News {{gave the}} video a very {{positive}} review and breakdown, stating, [...] "So it's not exactly a stretch to call 'Moment 4 Life' the most Nicki Minaj video of all time. It takes basically every aspect of her personality — the fashionista, the glamazon, the princess, the badass, the cartoon character, the girly girl — and crams them together into one very shiny package. And then it wraps that package with nods to her past (the British accent, the mention of her Roman Zolanski alter-ego, the consummation of her Twit-lationship with Drake) for good measure. The end result {{is perhaps the most}} complete portrait of Minaj to date... There are very few silly wigs and nary a stitch of Spandex to be seen anywhere. It is basically our first glimpse at the real Nicki: a young woman who is more than just the sum of her parts, even if those parts are pretty interesting." [...] Chris Robinson of Idolator compared and contrasted the [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] wedding with other wedding music video's stating, [...] "We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> right now.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "War Pigs" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be called [...] "Walpurgis". It was then changed to [...] "War Pigs", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that {{the song of the}} same name had potential as a single. [...] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: [...] "I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' you know, the Satanic version of Christmas write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'." [...] In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, [...] "It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song... Geezer also liked {{to put a lot of}} topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the trial}} ended, the District Attorney's office {{received}} numerous open record requests for the videotape. David McDade inquired of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia whether the videotape {{had to be}} released under the Open Records Act. The Council concluded that [...] "if no one has filed for a protection order ... claiming that disclosure of the video tape would invade individual privacy, we can find no reason why disclosure of the video tape is not required under ... the Open Records Act." [...] Ignoring {{the fact that it}} was the Legislature that wrote the Open Records Law (and which caused the initial controversy by refusing to apply the [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] clause retroactively), Georgia State Sen. Emanuel Jones said he would introduce legislation to block district attorneys from handing over photographic images in sex cases. [...] "'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> the David McDade Act,' Jones said. 'Sometimes we have to protect our kids from district attorneys.'" [...] Because the participants shown having sex in the video were under 18, the videotape constitutes child pornography under federal law. [...] The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act prohibits prosecutors from allowing defendants in criminal proceedings to possess a copy of any evidence that constitutes child pornography, even if the purpose is to mount a defense against the charge. Under this law, Wilson and his defense team are prohibited from having a copy of the videotape that prosecutor McDade has distributed to anyone else who has requested it.|$|E
5000|$|... "Since You're Gone" [...] {{has since}} been praised by many music critics. AllMusic critic Donald Guarisco {{described}} the song as [...] "a solid showcase for strong balance between forward-thinking sounds and classic pop songwriting, using a high-tech arrangement and new wave irony to breath {{new life into the}} power ballad", <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a solid fusion of rock ballad bombast and new wave futurism that charted just outside the pop chart Top 40." [...] Greg Prato, also of AllMusic, said [...] "the melancholic [...] "Since You're Gone" [...] remains one of Ocasek's best-ever tales of heartbreak".|$|R
5000|$|Michiko Kakutani {{called the}} book [...] "galvanic" [...] and wrote that it showcased Franzens talent as a storyteller and [...] "his ability to throw open a big, Updikean picture window on American middle-class life."

2500|$|Paranoid was {{originally}} titled War Pigs, but {{the record company}} allegedly changed it {{out of fear of}} a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change {{had nothing to do with}} the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't want anything to do with them: [...] "We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. [...] I knew we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'War Pigs'." [...] Regarding the song [...] "Paranoid", Smith recalls, [...] "It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single. [...] "That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve," [...] Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. [...] "What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork." ...|$|E
