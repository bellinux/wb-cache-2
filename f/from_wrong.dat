5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right <b>from</b> <b>wrong.</b> Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.|$|E
25|$|Classical jurists {{held that}} human reason {{is a gift}} from God which should be {{exercised}} to its fullest capacity. However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right <b>from</b> <b>wrong,</b> and that rational argumentation must draw its content {{from the body of}} transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.|$|E
25|$|Although the defense's expert {{testimony}} agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, {{in order to}} successfully assert the insanity defense, the defendant must prove {{that he or she}} could not discern right <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> {{at the time of the}} crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found her guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced her to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with eligibility for parole in 40 years.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set [...] "age" [...] for this to occur; it is only when the child learns {{the difference between right and}} wrong that they are accountable (...) [...] Congregations differ in their interpretation of the age of accountability.|$|E
500|$|In December, the Chinese foreign {{ministry}} continued {{to denounce the}} award as [...] "interference by a few clowns". It said [...] "more than 100 countries and international organisations [...] expressed explicit support of China's position opposing this year's peace prize." [...] However, according to the Nobel Committee, only the 65 countries with diplomatic missions were invited; acceptances had been received from 46 countries, including the previously non-committal India, while China and 19 others—Afghanistan, Algeria, Argentina, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tunisia, Venezuela and Vietnam—declined invitations to the award ceremony [...] "for various reasons". On {{the eve of the}} award ceremony, China continued the rhetoric against the Nobel Committee and the West. A spokesman said: [...] "We hope that those countries who have received invitations can tell right <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and uphold justice. It's not an issue of human rights. It's an issue of interfering in other countries' internal affairs"; the Nobel committee continued to be criticised for [...] "encouraging crime"; the Global Times repeated earlier suggestions that the award was a Western conspiracy against Beijing, a [...] "charge against China's ideology, aiming to undermine the benign surroundings for China's future development." ...|$|E
500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right <b>from</b> <b>wrong,</b> but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who think they can con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{canonical}} texts state right livelihood as avoiding and abstaining <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> livelihood. This {{virtue is}} further explained in Buddhist texts, states Vetter, as [...] "living from begging, but not accepting everything and not possessing {{more than is}} strictly necessary". For lay Buddhists, states Harvey, this precept requires that the livelihood avoid causing suffering to sentient beings by cheating them, or harming or killing them in any way.|$|E

2500|$|As {{assistant}} to Oliver Cromwell, Milton also {{took part in}} drafting a constitution of the Independents (Agreement of the People; 1647) that strongly stressed the equality of all humans {{as a consequence of}} democratic tendencies. In his Areopagitica, Milton provided one of the first arguments for the importance of freedom of speech– [...] "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties". His central argument was that the individual is capable of using reason to distinguish right <b>from</b> <b>wrong.</b> To be able to exercise this right, everyone must have unlimited access to the ideas of his fellow men in [...] "a free and open encounter", and this will allow the good arguments to prevail.|$|E
2500|$|Repentance {{is also a}} {{prerequisite}} for receiving the Holy Ghost. UPCI sources emphasize {{that no one can}} repent on his or her own power; it requires a supernatural gift of God's grace. It does not bring by itself the full power of salvation, and unless it is followed up with baptism in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and baptism of the Holy Ghost with the evidence of tongues, it may be lost. Also, a child may not be baptized until the child knows right <b>from</b> <b>wrong,</b> because the child can not repent of the sins they have as a baby. [...] Being that all are born into sin, we all have sin when we are born. Furthermore, the ability to repent is temporary and may only be accomplished while one is alive. Luke 13:3 ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese {{wrote of}} other unicorns, {{such as the}} Xiezhi, but it was less like a real animal and more a {{symbolic}} figure. It {{had the ability to}} discriminate right <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> and therefore a representation of it was placed in the courtrooms of the Han dynasty and, in the 3rd and 4th centuries, on the caps of judges. It looks like a seated or standing lion with a horn rising {{from the top of the}} head. In contrast to this mythical beast, the k'i-lin is presented as an animal actually caught by hunting parties of the past. The Shiji ("Historical Records") of Sima Qian in the 2nd century mentions the capture of a [...] "deer-like" [...] animal with one horn in 122BC. The Chunqin, an encyclopaedia of the 3rd century BC, states that a unicorn was captured in 481BC, but without any description. Chinese representations of unicorns vary quite a lot, but an engraving on a bronze vessel of the Warring States period shows an animal very like the cave paintings supposed to be of Elasmotherium: head down for grazing, horn protruding horizontally from the forehead, neck and shoulders humped.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{peculiar}} tracks on the album include [...] "Bonsai People", which is a Red Hot Chili Peppers type funk metal song. The lyrics compare childlike people to bonsai trees {{in a way that}} they are tiny (humble, God-fearing) but as a strong breed they can endure the rending of wind (temptation) since their roots are deeply entrenched into soil (word of God). [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] on the other hand is a dark, melodic black metal type song which begins with oppressive clean guitaring. With a haunting voice a person whispers the words [...] "Hell is a totally cool site, so let's get there, all right?". This sentence is probably an attempt to describe the attitude of some of the black metal fans; the lyrics tell that those who say things like that are under the 'spell of hell' which the devil uses to mislead people. Consecutively, it can be said that [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] was Deuteronomium's way of expressing their stance on the black metal movement which had at that time become very popular, with Emperor and likes being played on the Finnish metal radio program 'Metalliliitto', as the band members recall in an interview. [...] "Spell of Hell" [...] became Deuteronomium's best known song. The songs [...] "III" [...] and [...] "Northern Praise" [...] are also black metal influenced and present more worshipful lyrics, the forementioned is vocalized in Finnish and refers to the trinity of God. The latter is also a somewhat popular song as it is noted for being one of their best known songs. The self-titled song [...] "Street Corner Queen" [...] is a punk rock influenced death metal song about a prostitute, the lyrics tell that she sells love though deep inside she knows that it's not love at all, and that she seeks comfort <b>from</b> <b>wrong</b> ways. [...] "Druglord" [...] is another punk rock influenced death metal track. The lyrics are written from the perspective of a young person who suffers from drug addiction.|$|E
