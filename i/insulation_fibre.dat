50|$|On {{the cold}} {{side of the}} {{insulation}} the temperature gradient gets steeper with increasing air outward flow. This is because the air, having now cooled, is {{no longer able to}} transfer heat to the <b>insulation</b> <b>fibres.</b> In pro-flux mode heat is flowing out of the wall at a greater rate than the case for conventional insulation. Warm moist air flowing out through the insulation and cooling rapidly increases the risk of condensation occurring within the insulation which will degrade the thermal performance of the wall and could, if prolonged, lead to mould growth and timber decay.|$|R

50|$|As {{air flows}} inwards through the {{insulation}} it picks up, via the <b>insulation</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{the heat that}} is being conducted to the outside. Dynamic insulation is thus able to achieve the dual function of reducing the heat loss through the walls and/or roof whilst {{at the same time}} supplying pre-warmed air to the indoor spaces. Dynamic insulation would appear, therefore, to overcome the major disadvantage of airtight envelopes which is that the quality of the indoor air will deteriorate unless there is natural or mechanical ventilation. However, dynamic insulation also requires mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in order to recover the heat in the exhaust air.|$|R

5000|$|Fibres may be texturised {{to improve}} the <b>fibre's</b> <b>insulation</b> {{properties}} (as processes like bulking allow it to trap air better), to minimise a shiny, synthetic-looking appearance, to reduce the silky nature of the fibre, or to create special effects (fancy yarns).|$|R
50|$|Dynamic {{insulation}} {{is a form}} {{of insulation}} where cool outside air flowing through the thermal insulation in the envelope of a building will pick up heat from the <b>insulation</b> <b>fibres.</b> Buildings can be designed to exploit this to reduce the transmission heat loss (U-value) and to provide pre-warmed, draft free air to interior spaces. This is known as dynamic insulation since the U-value is no longer constant for a given wall or roof construction but varies with the speed of the air flowing through the insulation (climate adaptive building shell). Dynamic insulation is different from breathing walls. The positive aspects of dynamic insulation need to be weighed against the more conventional approach to building design which is to create an airtight envelope and provide appropriate ventilation using either natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. The air-tight approach to building envelope design, unlike dynamic insulation, results in a building envelope that provides a consistent performance in terms of heat loss and risk of interstitial condensation that is independent of wind speed and direction. Under certain wind conditions a dynamically insulated building can have a higher heat transmission loss than an air-tight building with the same thickness of insulation.|$|R

40|$|Loss of coolant {{accidents}} (LOCA) in {{the primary}} cooling circuit of a nuclear reactor may result in damage to insulation materials that are located near to the leak. The insulation materials released may compromise {{the operation of the}} emergency core cooling system (ECCS). Insulation material in the form of mineral wool fibre agglomerates (MWFA) maybe transported to the containment sump strainers mounted at the inlet of the emergency cooling pumps, where the <b>insulation</b> <b>fibres</b> may block or penetrate the strainers. In addition to the impact of MWFA on the pressure drop across the strainers, corrosion products formed over time may also accumulate in the fibre cakes on the strainers, which can lead to {{a significant increase in the}} strainer pressure drop and result in cavitation in the ECCS. Thus, knowledge of transport characteristics of the damaged insulation materials in various scenarios is required to help plan for the long-term operability of nuclear reactors, which undergo LOCA. An experimental and theoretical study performed by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf and the Hochschule Zittau/Görlitz 1 is investigating the phenomena that maybe observed in the containment vessel during a LOCA. The study entails the generation of fibre agglomerates, the determination of their transport properties in single and multi-effect experiments and the long-term effect that corrosion of the containment internals by the coolant has on the strainer pressure drop. The focus of this presentation is on the experiments performed that characterize the horizontal transport of MWFA, whereas the corresponding CFD simulations are described in an accompanying contribution (see abstract of Cartland Glover et al.). The experiments were performed a racetrack type channel that provided a near uniform horizontal flow. The channel is 0. 1 wide by 1. 2 m high with a straight length of 5 m and two bends of 0. 5 m. The measurement techniques include particle imaging (both wide-angle and macro lens), concurrent particle image velocimetry, ultravelocimetry, laser detection sensors to sense the presence of absence of MWFA and pertinent measurements of the MWFA concentration and quiescent settling characteristics. The transport of the MWFA was observed at velocities of 0. 1 and 0. 25 m s- 1 to verify numerical model behaviour in and just beyond expected velocities in the containment sump of a nuclear reactor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Procedures are {{presented}} in this paper for finding the thermal resis-tance of thick products when the thermal resistance can not be measured directly because the specimen thickness exceeds the apparatus capabilities, typically 10 - 15 cm for guarded hot plate and heat flow meter apparatus, and when it can not simply be calculated as the sum of the thermal resistances of slices cut from the product because of the so-called thickness effect. The proposed method is applicable to air filled in-sulating materials, i. e., only air in the cells or among the fibres. It consists of using interpolating equations, one measurement, and a set of material parameters that are known for the family products. For some insulating materials, diagrams are also sup-plied which correlate the specimen transfer factor (called thermal conductivity) with specimen thickness and material thermal transmissivity (the measured thermal con-ductivity at thicknesses such that the thickness effect may be neglected).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new modelling approach to analyse the fire structural response of fibreglass-polymer composites protected with an insulation surface layer consisting of thermally passive or active (intumescent) material. The model {{is designed to}} predict the temperature, decomposition, softening and failure of fibreglass composites protected from fire with either a passive or active surface coating. The modelling involves a multi-stage analytical approach: (i) thermal analysis of the surface coating (including decomposition and expansion {{in the case of}} the intumescent material), (ii) thermal-chemical analysis of heat transfer through the composite substrate (beneath the surface coating), including decomposition of the polymer matrix and softening of the fibreglass reinforcement, and (iii) thermal-mechanical analysis of the failure of the composite under tension or compression loading. Fire structural tests were performed on a woven glass/vinyl ester composite protected with either a thermally passive <b>insulation</b> (ceramic <b>fibre)</b> or an organic intumescent coating to validate the modelling approach.

40|$|Improving {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of existing domestic buildings can have multiple benefits: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing {{the cost of}} heating and therefore fuel poverty, improving comfort and health. Solid wall buildings constitute around 30 % of UK housing stock, and are among the least efficient. However, the installation of solid wall insulation, while improving thermal performance can significantly affect the moisture balance of the building. This can result in mould growth, which can cause structural damage and lead to health problems for the occupants. This thesis explores the use of Natural <b>Fibre</b> <b>Insulation</b> (NFI) materials for internal solid wall insulation. The hygrothermal properties {{of a range of}} NFI materials are characterised in order to assess their potential for retrofit applications. This is followed by large-scale testing, which compares three solid wall insulation systems in controlled conditions, the results of which are used to validate a heat and moisture transfer model to further assess performance. Experimental results showed that the risk of interstitial condensation is significantly reduced by the application of natural <b>fibre</b> <b>insulation</b> in comparison to a conventional rigid foam system. Simulation of a solid wall exposed to climatic conditions for the UK revealed that the relative humidity at the interface between the masonry and insulation layers remained at 69 % when internally insulated with hemp-lime and 96 % with rigid foam insulation, while average moisture content of the masonry was 48 % lower when hemp-lime was used. Field tests were also conducted to determine the thermal performance of two solid walls internally insulated with 80 mm of hemp-lime when exposed to real weather conditions. The thermal conductivity of the hemp-lime was found to be 30 % higher than when measured in dry stead-state laboratory conditions due to the high moisture content of the masonry.

The main raw materials are aerobically aged hemp stalks. The samples are made of hemp chips, fastened together using the UF and PF glue. The use of preserved chopped hemp to produce slabs allows using all the stalks and also the leaves and seeds without waiting for their full maturity. That makes harvesting of the raw material independent of the weather. The material can be stored compactly, decreasing changes in the properties of the material, significantly shortening the recycling period and accordingly reducing the energy demand and simplifying the technological process. Research was done to find an innovative production technology of a heat and sound insulating material to be used in construction. During the research a technology was created for a mixture of hemp which involved finding an optimal mulching degree of the hemp stalks, testing the best suited glue (including natural glues) for this operation, testing the impact of the slab thickness on the quality parameters –sound (not described in this article) and heat insulation.
