40|$|Abstract — Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) is a {{well known}} method for <b>fault</b> location, especially <b>in</b> power distribution networks. This paper presents the application of TDR for detecting <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> fieldbus wiring, {{since most of the}} <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> fieldbuses that are detected during initiation of operation are simply <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring. These <b>faults</b> can be identified in the pulse reflection image by recognition of basic pulse reflection patterns. Because, this method is faced with a lot of practical problems, this paper introduces simulation as a new way to find <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring in fieldbuses before the initiation of operation. During operation, <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> wiring can be detected in realtime with a differential method, if a TDR-function is integrated into the fieldbus.

40|$|The most {{reliable}} of the globally available relative data {{have been used}} to derive empirical for-mulas which relate the subsurface fault length, L, the fault area, S, and fault width, w, with the mo-ment magnitude, M. Separate such formulas have been derived for earthquakes generated by strike-slip faulting, by dip-slip <b>faulting</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and by dip-slip <b>faulting</b> <b>in</b> lithospheric subduction regions. The formula which relates the fault area with the magnitude is combined with the definition formulas of seismic moment and moment magnitude to derive also relations between the fault slip, u, and the moment magnitude {{for each of the three}} seismotectonic regimes. For a cer-tain magnitude, the fault length is larger for strike-slip faults than for dip-slip faults, while the fault width is small for strike-slip faults, larger for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and much larger for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> regions of lithospheric subduction. For a certain magnitude, fault slip is about the same for strike-slip faults and dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> continental regions and smaller for dip-slip <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> regions of lithospheric subduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{conceptual}} growth {{models for}} <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> layered sequences suggest that <b>faults</b> first localise <b>in</b> strong, and brittle, layers and are later linked in weak, and ductile, layers. We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for modelling {{the growth of}} a normal <b>fault</b> <b>in</b> a brittle/ductile multilayer sequence. The modelling reveals that <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> brittle/ductile sequences at low confining pressure and high strength contrast localise first as Mode I fractures in the brittle layers. Low amplitude monoclinal folding prior to failure is accommodated by ductile flow in the weak layers. The initially vertically segmented fault arrays are later linked via shallow dipping <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> the weak layers. Faults localise, therefore, as geometrically and kinematically coherent arrays of <b>fault</b> segments <b>in</b> which abandoned <b>fault</b> tips or splays are a product of the strain localisation process and do not necessarily indicate linkage of initially isolated faults. The modelling suggests that <b>fault</b> tip lines <b>in</b> layered sequences are more advanced in the strong layers compared to weak layers, where the difference in propagation distance is most likely related to strength and/or ductility contrast. Layer dependent variations <b>in</b> <b>fault</b> propagation rates generate fringed rather than smooth <b>fault</b> tip lines <b>in</b> multilayers...|$|R

In the case of <b>fault</b> diagnosis <b>in</b> instruments (FDI) there {{are different}} diagnosis schemes {{based on the number}} of observers: the Simplified Observer Scheme (SOS) only requires one observer, uses all the inputs and only one output, detecting <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> one detector; the Dedicated Observer Scheme (DOS), which again uses all the inputs and just one output, but this time there is a bank of observers capable of locating multiple <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> sensors, and the Generalized Observer Scheme (GOS) which involves a reduced bank of observers, where each observer uses all the inputs and m- 1 outputs, and allows the localization of unique faults. This work proposes a new scheme named Simplified Interval Observer SIOS-FDI, which does not requires the measurement of any input and just with just one output allows the detection of unique <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> sensors and because it does not require any input, it simplifies in an important way the diagnosis of <b>faults</b> <b>in</b> processes in which it is difficult to measure all the inputs, as in the case of biologic reactors...|$|R
