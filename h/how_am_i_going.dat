500|$|Hillenburg {{used some}} {{character}} designs from his comic book. He designed [...] "SpongeBob's grumpy next door neighbor" [...] as an octopus because the species' large head; octopi, he said, [...] "have {{such a large}} bulbous head and Squidward thinks he's an intellectual so of course, he's gonna have a large bulbous head." [...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get {{a whole lot of}} big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants". However, it occurs in [...] and the sixth season episode, [...] "Giant Squidward".|$|E
500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? <b>How</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to get through this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

What's to become of her! God wot! <b>How</b> <b>be</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to face her with the news, and <b>how</b> <b>be</b> <b>I</b> to hold it from her? To bring this disgrace on my father's honoured name, a double-tongued knave!' He turned and shook his fist at the chapel and all in it, and resumed his way.|$|R
60|$|I sniffed, and {{continued}} to stride. I must see Mother Anastasia in Washington, because there I might {{have a chance of}} speaking to her freely, which I could not expect to have anywhere else; and yet <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to explain to her, or to any one else, my desire to speak with her at all? It might have been difficult to explain this to myself; at all events, I did not try to do it. Suddenly an idea struck me.|$|R

2500|$|About {{her first}} Olympic memory, she said, [...] "I {{remember}} watching Carly Patterson. She {{was one of}} my favorites. I loved her floor routine. I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] I remember seeing the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. I thought they were so little and so amazing. I thought, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to stay this little? I was worried that I was going to be really tall because my dad is 6'3" [...] and my mom is 5'2", so I didn’t know which one I was going to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The Guardian, [...] "oth {{perpetrator}} and victim enter {{a conspiracy}} of silence and why male survivors often find, once their story is discovered, that they lose the support and comfort of those around them. In the patriarchal societies found in many developing countries, gender roles are strictly defined. [...] Often, [...] wives who discover their husbands have been raped decide to leave them. [...] "They ask me: 'So now <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to live with him? As what? Is this still a husband? Is it a wife?' They ask, 'If he can be raped, who is protecting me?'".|$|E
2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to get by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at [...] midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E

5000|$|His {{first solo}} single, [...] "Blues Get Off My Shoulder", was {{recorded}} in 1958, {{while he was still}} working primarily with Williams' band. The B-side, [...] "You Got What It Takes", also written by Parker, was later recorded for Motown by Marv Johnson, but with the songwriting credited to Berry Gordy, Gwen Fuqua and Roquel Davis. Parker told the Forgotten Hits newsletter in 2008:"I wrote 'You've Got What It Takes,' that was MY song. Even had the Paul Hucklebuck Williams band playing on it behind me... And then Berry Gordy just stole it out from under me, just put his name on it. And what could <b>I</b> do? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just trying to make a living, playing guitar and singing, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to go on and fight Berry Gordy, big as he was, and Motown Records?

40|$|Why People Get Lost demands no {{specialized}} {{knowledge of}} neuroscience, as its inside flap advertises. This {{is true to}} an extent; the book is an academic behemoth of research and data, but Dudchenko guides the reader through it with engaging anecdotes that inject a personal flair into the hard science. He writes with a refreshing directness, beginning each new subject with an introduction that tells the reader: {{this is what you}} are going to learn, this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to show you, and this is why you should care.

40|$|As I {{prepared}} {{to design and}} write a third Year University course for social workers, an open campus course for sociologists entitled Social Work Law and Ethics for the University of the West Indies, and materials for other social scientists {{on the issue of}} law and ethics in social work, I realised that the primary issue was one of a dilemma or contradicting forces that needed to <b>be</b> reconciled. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to answer their main questions: What do I do? And whose side should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> on? (Becker 1967; Leibling 2001). And What if there is no compelling answer be able to refute their default position of “anything goes”? (Feyerbend, 1975). I had an idea that {{in the same way that}} I taught my research students to anchor the production of knowledge in a feminist standpoint methodology, this might just work for other social science practitioners, such as educators, criminal justice workers and philosophical inquirers. This paper outlines a re-conjuration of the concept of standpoint and <b>how</b> it can <b>be</b> used to assist and ground applying ethics and the engagement with law in the theorising of ethics in professional practice...|$|R
