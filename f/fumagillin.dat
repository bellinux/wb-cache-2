50|$|N. ceranae is {{apparently}} {{released from the}} suppressive effects of <b>fumagillin</b> at higher concentrations than that of N. apis. At <b>fumagillin</b> concentrations that continue to impact honey bee physiology, N. ceranae thrives and doubles its spore production. The current application protocol for <b>fumagillin</b> may exacerbate N. ceranae infection rather than suppress it. <b>Fumagillin</b> application should be {{a major cause of}} N. ceranae dominance in this time.|$|E
50|$|There {{are reports}} that <b>fumagillin</b> {{controls}} Nosema ceranae, which has recently been hypothesized as a possible cause of colony collapse disorder.The latest report, however, has shown it to be ineffective against N. ceranae. <b>Fumagillin</b> is also investigated as an inhibitor of malaria parasite growth.|$|E

50|$|Numerous studies {{implicate}} MetAP2 in angiogenesis. Specifically, the {{covalent binding}} {{of either the}} ovalicin or <b>fumagillin</b> epoxide moiety to the active site histidine residue of MetAP2 {{has been shown to}} inactivate the enzyme, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. The way in which MetAP2 regulates angiogenesis has yet to be established, however, such that further study is required to validate that antiangiogenic activity results directly from MetAP2 inhibition. Nevertheless, with both the growth and metastasis of solid tumors depending heavily on angiogenesis, <b>fumagillin</b> and its analogs—including TNP-470, caplostatin, and beloranib—as well as ovalicin represent potential anticancer agents.Moreover, the ability of MetAP2 to decrease cell viability in prokaryotic and small eukaryotic organisms has made it a target for antibacterial agents. Thus far, both <b>fumagillin</b> and TNP-470 have been shown to possess antimalarial activity both in vitro and in vivo, and fumarranol, another <b>fumagillin</b> analog, represents a promising lead.|$|E

50|$|MetAP2 {{is found}} in all organisms and is {{especially}} important because of its critical role in tissue repair and protein degradation. Furthermore, MetAP2 {{is of particular interest}} because the enzyme {{plays a key role in}} angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, which is necessary for the progression of diseases including solid tumor cancers and rheumatoid arthritis. MetAP2 is also the target of two groups of anti-angiogenic natural products, ovalicin and <b>fumagillin,</b> and their analogs.|$|E
50|$|Penicillium scabrosum is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Trichocomaceae. Described as new to science in 1990, it was first {{isolated}} from soil associated with corn in Denmark. It has also been found in soil samples from other temperate areas of the world, including Canada. The fungus is a spoilage organism for foods, particularly those with lipid- and cereal-containing feed. It produces several mycotoxins, including <b>fumagillin,</b> viridicatin, and viridicatol. P. scabrosum is classified in Penicillium subgenus Penicillium, section Divaricatum, series Atroveneta.|$|E
50|$|Angiogenesis inhibitors lack {{clinical}} evidence of efficacy in endometriosis therapy. Under experimental in vitro and in vivo conditions, compounds {{that have been}} shown to exert inhibitory effects on endometriotic lesions include growth factor inhibitors, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, <b>fumagillin</b> analogues, statins, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, phytochemical compounds, immunomodulators, dopamine agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, progestins, danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. However, many of these agents are associated with undesirable side effects and more research is necessary. An ideal therapy would diminish inflammation and underlying symptoms without being contraceptive.|$|E
5000|$|Ovalicin, <b>fumagillin,</b> {{and their}} {{derivatives}} exhibit strong anti-angiogenesis properties and have seen numerous total syntheses since their isolation. [...] Notably, Corey and Dittami reported the first total synthesis of racemic ovalicin in 1985 {{followed by two}} asymmetric syntheses reported in 1994 by Samadi and Corey which featured a chiral pool strategy from L-quebrachitol and an asymmetric dihydroxylation, respectively. In 2010, Yadav and coworkers reported a route that intercepted the Samadi route from the chiral pool starting material D-ribose. A standard Rubottom oxidation gives a single stereoisomer due to substrate control and represents the key stereogenic step in the route to the Samadi ketone. Once synthesized, the Samadi ketone could be elaborated to (−)-ovalicin through known steps.|$|E
5000|$|Donald E. Ingber soon {{discovered}} that a fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, secreted a chemical, <b>fumagillin,</b> that inhibited angiogenesis. Takeda performed medicinal chemistry to optimize it, leading to development of TNP-470. [...] Folkman's team later tested it in adults with hemangiomas; they also used interferon alpha, an already approved drug that they had already shown to be an angiogenesis inhibitor, to treat infants with hemangiomas {{in some of the}} first clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors which were published in 1992. [...] In these trials they also studied the levels of fibroblast growth factor in the urine of the trial subjects and published that work in 1994; {{these were some of the}} first explorations of the use of biomarkers in clinical trials as surrogate endpoints.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the two types is how quickly N. ceranae can cause a colony to die. Bees can die within 8 days after exposure to N. ceranae, a finding not yet confirmed by other researchers. The forager caste seems the most affected, leaving the colony presumably to forage, but never returning. This results in a reduced colony consisting mostly of nurse bees with their queen, a state very similar to that seen in CCD. Little advice on treatment is available, but {{it has been suggested that}} the most effective control of N. ceranae is the antibiotic <b>fumagillin</b> as recommended for N. apis.The genome of N. ceranae was sequenced in 2009. This should help scientists trace its [...] patterns, establish how it became dominant, and help measure the spread of infection by enabling diagnostic tests and treatments to be developed.|$|E
50|$|Enterocytozoon bieneusi, {{commonly}} known as microsporidia, is a unicellular, obligate intracellular eukaryote. Their life cycle includes a proliferative merogonic stage, followed by a sporogonic stage resulting in small, environmentally resistant, infective spores, which is their transmission mode. The spores contain a long, coiled polar tube, which distinguishes them from all other organisms and has {{a crucial role in}} host cell invasion. E. bieneusi was first found in an AIDS patient in France in 1985 and was later found in swine in 1996 in fecal samples. It causes diarrhea—thus the pigs excrete more spores, causing the disease to spread. As this pathogen is very prevalent throughout the world, E. bieneusi is found {{in a wide variety of}} hosts including pigs, humans, and other mammals. E. bieneusi can be studied using TEM, light microscopy, PCR and immunofluorescence and can be cultured for short-term. It is not yet known whether the pathogen itself can be infected by other diseases. There seems to be widespread economic implications of infection by this pathogen for the swine industry. Several treatments, including <b>fumagillin</b> and albendazole have showed promise in treating infection (Mathis et al. 2005).|$|E
5000|$|This {{pathogen}} {{has been}} tentatively linked to colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon reported {{primarily from the}} United States, since fall of 2006. Highly preliminary evidence of N. ceranae was reported in a few hives in the Central Valley area of California. [...] "Tests of genetic material taken from a [...] "collapsed colony" [...] in Merced County point to a once-rare microbe that previously affected only Asian bees but might have evolved into a strain lethal to those in Europe and the United States." [...] The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; [...] "We don't want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved." [...] A USDA bee scientist has similarly stated, [...] "while the parasite nosema ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy." [...] Likewise, a Washington State beekeeper familiar with N. ceranae in his own hives discounts it as being the cause of CCD. In early 2009, Higes et al. reported an association between CCD and N. ceranae was established free of confounding factors, and that weakened colonies treated with <b>fumagillin</b> recovered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: After a brief {{account of}} the syntheses {{previously}} described in literature, several approaches of the antiangiogenic sesquiterpene <b>fumagillin</b> are described. Particularly, a Claisen–Ireland ring-closing metathesis strategy allowed the stereoselective preparation of several advanced intermediates in the <b>fumagillin</b> synthesis. <b>Fumagillin</b> 1, isolated in 1951 by Elbe and Hanson [1] from the microbial organism Aspergillus fumigatus, is representative of a class of sesquiterpenes such as ovalicin 2 [2] and FR 65814 3 [3], which display interesting biological activities. <b>Fumagillin</b> itself was first described as an antimicrobial agent, but more recently, Folkman and coworkers [4] discovered that this compound is a potent and selective inhibitor of angiogenesis. The same activity has been reported later for ovalicin 2 [5] which, as FR 65814 3, is also a potent immunosuppressor [3]. More recently, semisynthetic compound TNP- 470 4 [6, 7] showed a better therapeutic index than <b>fumagillin</b> 1. The recent discovery that methionine aminopeptidase II (MetAp-II) is selectively inhibited by <b>fumagillin</b> 1 [8] and the X-ray structure of the covalent complex between <b>fumagillin</b> 1 and MetAp-II [9] increases {{the interest of the}} synthesis of <b>fumagillin</b> 1 and of new <b>fumagillin</b> analogs [10, 11].
