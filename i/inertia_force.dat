2500|$|In a flow {{distribution}} network that progresses {{from a large}} tube to many small tubes (e.g. a blood vessel network), the frequency, density, and dynamic viscosity are (usually) the same throughout the network, but the tube radii change. [...] Therefore, the Womersley number is large in large vessels and small in small vessels. As the vessel diameter decreases with each division the Womersley number soon becomes quite small. The Womersley numbers tend to 1 {{at the level of}} the terminal arteries. In the arterioles, capillaries, and venules the Womersley numbers are less than one. In these regions the <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> becomes less important and the flow is determined by the balance of viscous stresses and the pressure gradient. This is called microcirculation.|$|E
2500|$|The Womersley number {{arises in}} the {{solution}} of the linearized Navier Stokes equations for oscillatory flow (presumed to be laminar and incompressible) in a tube. [...] It expresses the ratio of the transient or oscillatory <b>inertia</b> <b>force</b> to the shear force. When [...] is small (1 or less), it means the frequency of pulsations is sufficiently low that a parabolic velocity profile has time to develop during each cycle, and the flow will be very nearly in phase with the pressure gradient, and will be given to a good approximation by Poiseuille's law, using the instantaneous pressure gradient. [...] When [...] is large (10 or more), it means the frequency of pulsations is sufficiently large that the velocity profile is relatively flat or plug-like, and the mean flow lags the pressure gradient by about 90 degrees. Along with the Reynolds number, the Womersley number governs dynamic similarity.|$|E
