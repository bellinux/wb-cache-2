25|$|Concurrent to the Second Intifada, <b>Israeli</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> {{proposed}} the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2003, which {{was approved by}} the Israeli government in June 2004, and the Knesset in February 2005. The unilateral withdrawal plan was executed in August 2005 and completed in September 2005. Nonetheless, the ICRC, the UN and various human rights organizations consider Israel still to be the de facto occupying power due to its control of Gaza's borders, air space and territorial waters.|$|E
25|$|The Disengagement Plan was a {{proposal}} by <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon,</b> {{adopted by the}} government and enacted in August 2005, to remove a permanent Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip and from four Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank. The civilians were evacuated (many forcibly) and the residential buildings demolished after August 15, and the disengagement from the Gaza Strip was completed on 12 September 2005, when the last Israeli soldier left. The military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the assassination of its Secretary General Abu Ali Mustafa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), led by Ahmed Saadat, assassinated the Israeli Tourism Minister, Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001. Fuad Shubaki was suspected by Israel as being the mastermind behind the Karine A affair of 2002. Saadat, Shubaki, and four other Palestinians, including the man who shot Ze'evi, were held at the Jericho jail {{under the supervision of}} British and American wardens in accordance with a deal worked out between US President, George W. Bush and <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon,</b> in April 2002. The agreement allowed the prisoners to be transferred from Yasser Arafat's Mukataa in Ramallah, where they were hiding during Operation Defensive Shield of April 2002. The four cell members who actively participated in Ze'evi's assassination were Hamdi Quran, who pulled the trigger, Basel al-Amar, Majdi Rimawi and Ahed Gholami. In a quick military trial in Ramallah, headed by Brigadier-General Ribhi Arafat, they were sentenced to hard labor. Quran was sentenced to 18 years, Asmar to 12, Rimawi to eight and Gholami to one year. Saadat was never placed on trial. The prison was situated next to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government building. Israeli rightists opposed the deal, saying it allowed the assassin to escape justice, while Palestinians opposed the jailing of one of a senior militant leader under Israeli pressure.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider the intifada to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which the intifada lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling {{the end of the}} intifada. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed in the days leading to the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end of the intifada. The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> announced the cease-fire. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.|$|E

500|$|Amid the War on Terror {{and threat}} from Al Qaeda, Livingstone sought to build closer {{ties to the}} London's Muslim community, {{controversially}} agreeing to meet with Islamist groups like the Muslim Association of Britain alongside moderate organisations. In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E

He also announced agreement with Sharon's policy of denying the right of return. This led to condemnation from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Arab and European governments and was a major departure from previous U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} region.

Kaplan in which he wrote of Seelye that such [...] "Arabists and other area specialists may be emotionally involved, through marriage or friendship, with host countries - often causing them to dislike the policies that Washington orders them to execute." [...] Seelye and over 50 former US ambassadors and government officials signed the Middle East Policy Council's letter to President George W. Bush, criticizing US policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon's unilateral Gaza withdrawal plan, announced in 2004 and enacted in 2005 (letter cited below), which followed earlier British diplomats' letter to <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Tony Blair.|$|R

2500|$|On April 14, 2004, US President George W.

[...] Israeli officials {{argue that the}} pre-1967 armistice line is not a defensible border, since Israel would be nine miles wide at the thinnest point, subjected to rocket fire from the highlands of the West Bank, and unable to stop smuggling from Jordan across the Jordan Valley. Thus, Israeli officials have been arguing for the final-status borders to be readjusted to reflect security concerns.|$|E

In February 2005 CNI joined other concerned organizations in a meeting with Department of State officials regarding Israeli mistreatment of Palestinian American prisoners and called for the release of some of the prisoners. In May 2005 CNI joined with more than a dozen groups to protest the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee ("AIPAC") convention. In July 2006 CNI co-sponsored a protest of over 400 people at the Israeli Embassy during the 2006 Lebanon War between Israel and Hezbollah. In 2007 CNI joined 30 other groups calling for the U.S. government to obtain detailed site information on Israel's cluster bomb strikes in Lebanon during its 2006 attacks on that nation.

5000|$|Guerin was {{appointed}} the BBC's Jerusalem correspondent in January 2001. At {{the beginning of}} April 2002, the BBC made an official complaint to the Israeli government after Israeli soldiers fired {{in the direction of}} Guerin and her team, forcing them to find cover, while they were recording a peaceful demonstration in Bethlehem in the West Bank. Almost exactly two years later, the Israeli government wrote to the BBC accusing her of a [...] "deep-seated bias against Israel" [...] in a report on a teenage would-be suicide bomber. The BBC defended Guerin's reporting. Caroline Hawley succeeded her as the BBC's correspondent in Jerusalem. In December 2005, the BBC told Broadcast magazine that Guerin had spent two years longer in the Jerusalem posting than the normal three-year rotation usual for its correspondents. Former Director General of the BBC Greg Dyke wrote: [...] "I have no doubt that the decision by the BBC to pull their Middle East correspondent Orla Guerin out of the region and send her to South Africa was part of the normal rotation of BBC news correspondents around the world.
