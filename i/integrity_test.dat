2500|$|Kolya Vasin, {{the founder}} of The Beatles museum and the Temple of Love, Peace and Music in St. Petersburg, commented that The Beatles [...] "were like an <b>integrity</b> <b>test.</b> When anyone said {{anything}} against them, we knew just what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us." [...] Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government {{to prevent the spread}} of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West â€“ [...] "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies." [...] Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a [...] "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.|$|E

40|$|Although past {{research}} has shown links between <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> and the Big Five personality traits, {{little is known about}} the relationship between integrity and other individual difference constructs used to predict moral behavior. The present study expands this research by examining the relationships between ego development, moral reasoning, psychopathic personality, and three commonly used <b>integrity</b> <b>tests.</b> Both overt and personality-based <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> showed the strongest (negative) correlations with psychopathic personality but only modest correlations with ego development and moral reasoning. On the whole, these findings suggest that <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> may be more closely related to overt moral behavior than to moral reasoning. Purpose L ike many constructs in individual differences psychol-ogy, integrity can best be thought of as an open concept, with unclear boundaries and an unclear inner nature. Although there is no widespread agreement on the operational definition of integrity, most authors appear to agree that this construct incorporates a tendency to comply with social norms, avoid deviant behavior, and a embrace a sense of justice, truthfulness, and fairness (Becker, 2005). Most studies of <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> have investigated their relationships with the Big Five personality traits, with a particular focus on their significant associations with Conscientiousness (Ones, 1993). Nevertheless, the relation between Big Five Conscientiousness and the broader construct of morality ostensibly assessed by many <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> remains controversial (Loevinger, 1994; Spirrison, 1994). Moreover, relatively little research has examined how <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> relate tomore explicit correlates ofmora-lity. Thus, the present study is designed to determine how <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> relate to three other constructs believed to be related tomorality: ego development, moral reasoning, and psychopathic personality. By examining these constructs, we expect to provide further useful information concerning the boundaries and inner nature of the integrity construct...|$|R

If personality traits predict absenteeism, then {{it may be possible to}} use measures of these traits to identify and select job applicants and thereby reduce absenteeism rates. In this research, our goal was to examine whether <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> could be used to predict absenteeism. Meta-analysis was applied to studies of the validity of pre-employment <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> for predicting voluntary absenteeism. Twenty-eight studies based on a total sample of 13 972 were meta-analysed. The estimated mean predictive validity of personality-based <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> was 0. 33.
