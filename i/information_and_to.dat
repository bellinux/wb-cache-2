5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of an}} unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence how people respond to him and ultimately determine which ending is received.|$|E

On the next day, the Kenyans received intelligence about an impending counter-attack by the Jihadists, so that soldiers were sent on scouting missions to help gather more <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prepare Kulbiyow's defences. At the time, the base was held by a Kenyan company of 120 men, organized into four platoons, {{as well as an}} unspecified number of Somali government soldiers.|$|E

25|$|Information {{access is}} an area of {{research}} at the intersection of Informatics, Information Science, Information Security, Language Technology, Computer Science, and Library Science. The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> simplify users' access to it. What about assigning privileges and restricting access to unauthorized users? The extent of access should be defined in the level of clearance granted for the information. Applicable technologies include information retrieval, text mining, text editing, machine translation, and text categorisation. In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed or public access to information and is brought up in discussions on copyright, patent law, and public domain. Public libraries need resources to provide knowledge of information assurance.|$|E
25|$|Symbolic {{communication}} systems are distinguished from writing systems {{in that one}} must usually understand something of the associated spoken language to comprehend the text. In contrast, symbolic systems, such as information signs, painting, maps, and mathematics, often do not require prior knowledge of a spoken language. Every human community possesses language, a feature regarded by many as an innate and defining condition of mankind (see Origin of language). However the development of writing systems, and their partial supplantation of traditional oral systems of communication, have been sporadic, uneven, and slow. Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts and often preserve features and expressions that no longer exist in the spoken language. The greatest benefit of writing is that it provides the tool by which society can record information consistently and in greater detail, something {{that could not be}} achieved as well previously by spoken word. Writing allows societies to transmit <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> share knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Factors {{supporting}} {{an important}} role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least {{the components of the}} RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack W. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of self-sustained replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.|$|E

500|$|Caxias {{had made}} a short trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839 to inspect the troops {{fighting}} the Ragamuffins. Upon {{his return to the}} province in November 1842, he found that the rebels, severely weakened after years of struggle, had been forced to resort to guerrilla warfare. When threatened, the rebels escaped to safety in nearby Uruguay (formerly Cisplatina). As in Maranhão, São Paulo and Minas Gerais, Caxias planted spies within the enemy's ranks to gather <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> foment dissension. Historian Roderick J. Barman said that he [...] "displayed military, organizational, and political talents essential to what is now termed 'counterinsurgency'." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{background}} {{research to}} the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, {{secretary of the}} National Rifle Association at Bisley for <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> correct {{some of the more}} specialist areas of knowledge required for sniper shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by Pat Reid's escape from Colditz prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra. The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was Douglas Bader, who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions. The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on Amaryllis Fleming, Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: [...] "Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody." ...|$|E
