50|$|The use {{of quantum}} dots for tumor {{targeting}} under in vivo conditions employ two targeting schemes: active targeting and passive targeting. In {{the case of}} active targeting, quantum dots are functionalized with tumor-specific binding sites to selectively bind to tumor cells. Passive targeting uses the <b>enhanced</b> <b>permeation</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> of tumor cells for the delivery of quantum dot probes. Fast-growing tumor cells typically have more permeable membranes than healthy cells, allowing the leakage of small nanoparticles into the cell body. Moreover, tumor cells lack an effective lymphatic drainage system, which leads to subsequent nanoparticle-accumulation.|$|E
5000|$|Although SNALPs {{having a}} 100 nm {{diameter}} {{have been used}} effectively to target specific genes for silencing, {{there are a variety}} of systemic barriers that relate specifically to size. For example, diffusion into solid tumors is impeded by large SNALPs and, similarly, inflamed cells having <b>enhanced</b> <b>permeation</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> make it difficult for large SNALPs to enter. In addition, reticuloendothelial elimination, blood-brain barrier size-selectivity and limitations of capillary fenestrae all necessitate a smaller SNALP in order to effectively deliver target-specific siRNA. In 2012, scientists in Germany developed what they termed [...] "mono-NALPs" [...] using a fairly simple solvent exchange method involving progressive dilution of a 50% isopropanol solution. What results is a very stable delivery system similar to traditional SNALPs, but one having only a diameter of 30 nm. The mono-NALPs developed here, however, are inactive, but can become active carriers by implementing specific targeting and release mechanisms used by similar delivery systems.|$|E

Upon hydration, α-mangostin loaded niosomes were characterized for size, polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment efficiency (EE) and ζ-potential. The in vitro permeation experiments with dermis-split Yucatan Micropig (YMP) skin revealed that proniosomes composed of Spans, soya lecithin and cholesterol were able to <b>enhance</b> the skin <b>permeation</b> of α-mangostin with a factor range from 1. 8 - to 8. 0 -fold {{as compared to the}} control suspension. Furthermore, incorporation of soya lecithin in the proniosomal formulation significantly enhanced the viable epidermis/dermis (VED) concentration of α-mangostin.

In this study, systems composed of polyoxypropylene (5) polyoxyethylene (20) cetyl alcohol (PPG- 5 -CETETH- 20) as a surfactant, oleic acid as an oil phase, and water were developed as a possible fluconazole transdermal drug delivery system. The systems were characterised by polarised light microscopy (PLM), SAXS, and rheological analysis, followed by cellular and histological analyses, in vitro release assays, and ex vivo skin <b>permeation</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> studies using porcine ear tissue and a Franz diffusion cell. PLM and SAXS results indicated that the mixtures of surfactant, oil and water formed micellar and lamellar phases. The incorporation of fluconazole in these systems was greater than in water and conventional dosage forms. Micellar systems behave as Newtonian fluids, being more viscous than elastic in rheological analysis, and lamellar phases behave as pseudoplastic fluids with high elastic moduli. In vitro and in vivo biological assays showed that the formulations did not affect normal cell macrophages and did not promote skin irritation.

Using different surfactants, preliminary study to evaluate skin concentration suggested that Spans significantly (p < 0. 05) enhanced deposition of a-mangostin in the viable epidermis/dermis layer (VED) as compared to Tween 60. Incorporation of soya lecithin in the proniosomal formulation also significantly enhanced the VED concentration of a-mangostin.

Although various imaging modalities may be applied, high spatial resolution, low-cost and real-time display of fluorescence imaging provides a unique advantage [17, 18]. As most fluorescent drugs and dyes are small hydrophobic molecules, their selective accumulation in tumor tissue is contingent upon the circulation time.

The O-methyl free derivatives used in the study were fully trimethylated (100 %) N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) and N-propyl-(QuatPropyl), N-butyl-(QuatButyl) and N-hexyl (QuatHexyl) -N,N-dimethyl chitosan, with 85 - 91 % degree of quaternization. The fully trimethylated TMC, from 0. 25 mg/ml, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) in a reversible manner <b>and</b> <b>enhanced</b> the <b>permeation</b> of the macromolecule FITC-dextran 4 kDa (FD 4) 2 - 5 fold. TMC did not cause any alterations in the tight junction (TJ) protein claudin- 4 or in F-actin architecture. QuatHexyl was the most effective polymer to produce <b>enhanced</b> <b>permeation</b> <b>and</b> decreased TER from 0. 016 mg/ml. Nevertheless, this <b>enhanced</b> <b>permeation</b> was accompanied by reduced viability and dissociation of F-actin and claudin- 4 proteins. The structure-activity relationship suggests that more lipophilic derivatives show more permeation enhancement, TJ disassembly, and less viability in the order of hexyl≈butyl>propyl>methyl and demonstrates that the permeation effect is not only mediated by permanent positive charge but also by the extent of N-alkylation. These results are relevant to elucidate the structural factors contributing to the permeation enhancement of chitosan derivatives and for potential use in pulmonary applications...|$|R

However, the development of safe, efficient, and targetable gene delivery systems remains a major challenge in gene therapy. The unique material characteristics of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), including high surface area, facile surface modification, controllable size, and excellent magnetic properties, make them promising candidates for gene delivery. The engineered MNPs with modifiable functional surfaces and bioactive cores can result in several advantageous diagnostic and therapeutic properties including enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity, long <b>permeation</b> <b>and</b> <b>retention</b> in the circulatory system, specific delivery of therapeutic genes to target sites. In this review, the updated research on the preparation and surface modification of MNPs for gene delivery is summarized...|$|R
