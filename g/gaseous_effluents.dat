The initial fuel packages were either cooking oil or a single sofa; these were burned both alone, and in furnished surroundings. Experiments were performed at different ventilation conditions. Qualitative Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis found VOC/SVOC releases in the developing stages of the fires, and benzo(a) pyrene – the most carcinogenic PAH – was found in at least one sampling interval in the majority of fires. A number of phosphorus fire retardants were detected, in both the <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> and particulates, from fires where the initial fuel source was a sofa.

40|$|Adsorption is the {{attraction}} of gas molecules {{to the surface of}} an activated solid. There are two classifications of adsorption: physical and chemical. At ordinary temperatures, adsorption is usually caused by molecular forces rather than by the formation of chemical bonds. In this type of adsorption, called physical adsorption, very little heat is evolved. If a chemical reaction takes place between the gas and the solid surface, the process is known as chemisorption. In chemisorption the reaction between surface and gas molecules occurs in a stoichiometric manner, and heat is liberated during the reaction. Chemisorption is used in the removal of UF 6 and HF from <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> streams. It is also used to remove oil mist from vacuum pumps operating upstream of <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> ventilation systems. Adsorbent materials are placed on stationary beds in chemical traps downstream of the various cold traps. These materials capture HF and the trace amounts of UF 6 that escape desublimation during feed purification or during venting of residual UF 6 contained in hoses and/or piping that is bled down before disconnection. The chemical traps are placed in series downstream of the cold traps in the exhaust streams to the GEVS and may include one or more of a series of two different types of chemical traps. Th...|$|R

Particles of cellulose ([similar] 300 μm) were directly impinged upon the hot, catalytic bed of Rh–Ce/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst on 1. 3 mm α-Al 2 O 3 spheres in the presence of O 2, N 2, and steam in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor at 500 – 1100 °C. Complete conversion to gases was observed for all experimental parameters including N 2 /O 2, S/C, the total flow rate of cellulose, and the fuel-to-oxygen ratio (C/O). The addition of steam increased the selectivity to H 2 and decreased the selectivity to CO in agreement with water-gas-shift equilibrium.

40|$|Background: Food-processing <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents</b> {{are rich}} in {{flavoured}} volatile organic compounds (FVOCs). The discharge of these FVOCs is unwanted as they {{can contribute to the}} environmental olfactive pollution. Scope and approach: Their recovery would then enable their valuation through the strengthening of the organoleptic properties of the finished products or their use in other products, as well as reducing the pollution linked to their discharge.

40|$|International audienceComposite {{materials}} {{are more and}} more used every day. In order to further enhance their attractive mechanical and physico chemical performances, the last generation of these materials largely makes use of nanomaterials. Various nanofillers are eligible for such a purpose, the best ones depending on the associated matrices. One favorite field of application of these nanomaterials is fire retardancy and fire behavior of nanocomposites. In the context of the ANR research project NanoFeu, various technical analyses have been performed [1]. One focuses on the characterization of the dispersion of nanofillers in the matrix; another deals with the characterization of the fire behavior of samples including the study of the composition of the <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents,</b> the characterization of the emitted soot [2]. A third part of the work focused on molecular modeling of observed phenomena within the matrices. This paper focuses mainly on the combustion of nanocomposite samples under various ventilation conditions. Tests have been performed with the Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA). Samples are based on poly(methyl methacrylate); various nanofillers were used: carbon nanotubes, alumina and silica. Efficiency of fillers is compared to the classical ammonium polyphosphate in equal proportions. During testing, the ventilation-controlled conditions were obtained by adjusting the combustion air flow rate entering the apparatus. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>effluents</b> were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectrometer. Fire behavior is characterized in terms of fire parameters and chemical composition of <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluents.</b> The influence of ventilation conditions is especially significant in terms of amount of gases released: much more important production of specific gases is generally observed in case of under ventilation regime as compared to the well ventilated case...|$|E

The PTR-MS instrument ionized organic molecules in the gas phase through their reaction with H 3 O+, forming protonated molecules (MH+, where M is the neutral organic molecule) and fragment ions, which were detected by a standard quadrupole mass spectrometer. This process {{can be used with}} volatiles in air with or without dilution, since the primary constituents of air (nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide) have a proton affinity less than water and thus are not ionized. Most organic molecules (excepting alkanes) have a proton affinity greater than water and are therefore ionized and detected [Lindinger et al. 1998].|$|R

40|$|Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is the {{quantitative}} {{measurement of the}} enthalpic response of a material to a systematic change in temperature. In practice, the heat flow into or outward from a sample is measured as the sample is heated or cooled at a carefully controlled rate. DSC superficially resembles, but {{is not the same}} as differential thermal analysis (DTA), which is the measurement of temperature differences between a sample and reference material as the pair is heated or cooled. The fundamental properties measured by DSC are enthalpies and temperatures of phase transitions and constant-pressure heat capacities. Depending on instrument design and the nature of the sample, high-quality DSC analyses can be obtained on only a few milligrams of solid materials.

40|$|In {{separation}} of gases, membranes offer the greatest potential. In interaction with a membrane, {{a high degree}} of permeability coupled with a large selectivity of a specific gaseous species ensures superior performances in the gas processing industry. Economically, the advantage of membrane separation technology is immense. The {{separation of}} natural gas by thin barriers termed as membranes is a dynamic and rapidly growing field, and it has been proven to be technically and economically superior to other emerging technologies. This superiority is due to certain advantages which membrane technology benefits from, including low capital investment, low weight, and space requirement and high process flexibility. In the past ten years, the membrane gas separation technology has advanced greatly and can now be regarded as a competitive industrial gas separation method.

30|$|To {{effectively}} use PTR-MS and SPME GC-MS, {{the inherent}} differences in signal acquistion must be considered. Foremost, PTR-MS is a continuous measurement of VOCs in the gaseous stream stripped from an aqueous culture; SPME is a {{measurement of the}} headspace compounds that develop above a liquid aliquot after a 45 minute exposure and equilibration period. However, SPME is not truly an equilibrium measurement, because the concentration of the headspace is potentially being depleted by compounds adsorbing to the fiber, lowering their vapor pressure and thereby constantly shifting the headspace composition (Eq. 1) [Zeng and Noblet 2002]. SPME adsorbs VOCs from the headspace then estimates a liquid concentration based on one internal standard. Therefore, we anticipate differences in distribution of VOCs detected by the two methods (Figures 1 and 2). The measurement variability that exists between the two techniques should decrease if the <b>gaseous</b> <b>effluent</b> measured by the PTR-MS is at or near equilibrium with the compounds in the liquid. Based on the abiotic experimental results with a known mixture of VOC standards, equilibrium was assumed for the experimental reactor system.|$|R

These methods will be compared both quantitatively and qualitatively with respect to their applicability to the gas detection prob-lem. Comparison to truth outputs from the synthetic data provides an accurate quantitative measure of the algorithmic performance.
