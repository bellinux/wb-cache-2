The flags displayed measure approximately 3 m tall by 1.8 m wide (10ft by 6ft). <b>Each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> displays revolves around a different theme (such as the beauty of Gifu or AIDS Awareness) or are created by specific group of persons (for example, local school students or local artists).|$|E
5|$|When the Students' Building opened, {{it stood}} two stories tall with a basement, {{as well as}} wooden pillars on its facade {{supporting}} a pediment. A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the pediment led to a three sets of double doors—one large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above <b>each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> doors was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous dining rooms. Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in their style than the old central portion of the building.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of <b>each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Millwall and West Ham United {{is one of}} the longest-standing and most bitter in English football. The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, both {{originated}} in the East End of London, and were located under three miles apart. They first played each other in the 1899–1900 FA Cup. The match was historically known as the Dockers derby, as both sets of supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards {{on either side of the}} River Thames. Consequently, <b>each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business; this intensified the tension between the teams. In 1910, Millwall moved south of the River Thames to New Cross and the teams were no longer East London neighbours. Both sides have relocated since, but remain just under four miles apart. Millwall moved to The Den in Bermondsey in 1993 and West Ham to the London Stadium in Stratford in 2016.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on <b>each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.|$|E
25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. <b>Each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from <b>each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> remains.|$|E

50|$|A {{haven of}} order k in a graph G is a {{function}} &beta; that maps <b>each</b> <b>set</b> X <b>of</b> fewer than k vertices to a connected component of G &minus; X, {{in such a way}} that every two subsets &beta;(X) and &beta;(Y) touch each other. Thus, the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> images of &beta; forms a bramble in G, with order k. Conversely, every bramble may be used to determine a haven: for <b>each</b> <b>set</b> X <b>of</b> size smaller than the order of the bramble, there is a unique connected component &beta;(X) that contains all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint from X.|$|R

25|$|Instructions were {{implemented}} {{in groups of}} 12 steps, called timing pulses. The timing pulses were named TP1 through TP12. <b>Each</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 12 timing pulses was called an instruction subsequence. Simple instructions, such as TC, executed in a single subsequence of 12 pulses. More complex instructions required several subsequences. The multiply instruction (MP) used 8 subsequences: an initial one called MP0, followed by an MP1 subsequence which was repeated 6 times, and then terminated by an MP3 subsequence. This was reduced to 3 subsequences in Block II.|$|E
