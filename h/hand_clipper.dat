40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} identify the annual changes in hair follicle activity, changes at the follicular level and to characterize some of the fibre-follicle characteristics of camels at different ages. A total of 28 camels were allocated at random {{on the basis of}} age to one of four groups (2, 4, 6 and older than 8 years). All groups of camels were fed a maintenance level of ration throughout the experiment. To determine hair follicle cycle and other follicle characteristics samples of skin were taken using a trephine from the right midside of animals at approximately 28 day intervals for a period of 12 months. Using a small <b>hand</b> <b>clipper,</b> 15 g of fibre sample was taken from the left midside region to determine fibre characteristics. Analysis of variance was performed using a one-way SAS package and the means and the standard deviations of means were generated with this program. Mean S/P ratio, primary and secondary and total follicle densities of all groups of camels were 6. 85 ± 0. 75, 3. 76 ± 0. 63, 22. 29 ± 3. 57 and 25. 33 ± 3. 85, respectively. Mean fibre diameter, percentage of medullated and non-medullated fibre and clean wool percentage of all groups were 18. 98 ± 1. 64, 18. 10 ± 1. 65, 81. 89 ± 6. 98 and 77. 58 ± 4. 58, respectively. Mean percentage of active primary follicles significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased to lowest in February to a minimum of 83. 1 %, then significantly (p< 0. 05) increased over spring. Secondary follicle activity decreased over winter and spring to a minimum of 60 % in February. </p...|$|E

50|$|The wool from fat-tailed breeds {{is usually}} coarse and {{frequently}} has colored fibers. It {{would be of}} limited value in commercial markets. Today it is used primarily for rug-making and other cottage-type industries. Bedouin women make rugs and blankets from the wool. Some of their handiwork can be purchased in the villages of Egypt. Shearing in Egypt is done {{once or twice a}} year with <b>hand</b> <b>clippers.</b> There is a reluctance to use electric shears because of wool quality and the difficulty in getting replacement parts when they become dull or worn out.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Memphis {{finished}} with their best franchise record of 56-26, 2nd in the Division and as the 5th seed in the Playoffs. Also, Marc Gasol was NBA Defensive Player of the Year. In the opening round, Memphis defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in 6 Games after trailing in the series 0-2. This avenged their defeat from the previous year at the <b>hands</b> of the <b>Clippers.</b> Memphis then went on to the Western Conference Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history when they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 in their semi-finals series. This was a rematch of their meeting in the 2011 NBA Playoffs, which the Thunder won in 7 games. However, the Grizzlies' season ended in the conference finals as they were swept by the eventual conference champions, San Antonio Spurs in yet another rematch/reversal from the 2011 NBA Playoffs.|$|R
50|$|VanDeWeghe {{initially}} had a front-office {{role with}} the Dallas Mavericks, {{where he was}} instrumental in the development of Dirk Nowitzki. During his time in Dallas, VanDeWeghe also briefly served as an assistant head coach. On August 9, 2001, VanDeWeghe was named to the Nuggets' general manager position and oversaw a return by the Nuggets to the NBA playoffs. Major moves by VanDeWeghe included the drafting of Carmelo Anthony in 2003, the trade for Marcus Camby in 2002 and the hiring of George Karl as head coach in 2005. However, some other moves by VanDeWeghe backfired outright or failed to produce the desired returns, such as the drafting of draft bust Nikoloz Tskitishvili in 2002 and the sign-and-trade deal with the New Jersey Nets to acquire Kenyon Martin {{at the end of the}} 2003-04 season. Shortly following a first-round playoff elimination at the <b>hands</b> of the <b>Clippers</b> in the 2006 playoffs, the Nuggets announced that VanDeWeghe's contract would not be renewed.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of N levels on chemical composition and energy content of different barley varieties grown under north Anatolian arid condition. Experiment was established as a split-plot design in a randomized complete block, with three replications. Five different winter type barley varieties (Blbl 89, Tarm 92, Tokak 157 / 37, Yesevi 93 and Aday 1) were utilized. Five nitrogen levels (0, 45, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha 1) were also applied to each variety. Barley were harvested by <b>hand</b> using a <b>clipper</b> and air-dried. Then, grains were separated from straw and yields were determined. Grains were analyzed for DM, OM, CP, CF, EE, and IVOMD. NFE, ME, NEL values were also calculated. N fertilization had significant effect on concentrations of CP, CF, EE, total and grain yields (p< 0. 01). The concentrations of DM, CP, CF, NFE and IVODM and total yields were significantly different among barley varieties (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, approximately 90 kg N/ha seemed to be most proper N levels in general Tokak 157 / 37, Tarm 92, and Blbl 89 varieties seemed to be most consistent varieties for the region...|$|R
5000|$|According to the City of Fairfield website, Native Americans, such {{as those}} from the Ion culture, settled in the Rockville and Green Valley areas. Artifacts {{that have been found}} from some of the {{earliest}} human inhabitants of the Fairfield area are dated to be around five to six thousand years old, making them some of the oldest Native American settlements in Northern California. [...] The first European contact came in 1810 when the Spanish army was ordered to attack the Suisun Indians. In 1835 the Mexican General Vallejo was so magnanimous in victory over the Indian Chief Sem Yeto that the chief later became his ally in conflicts against other tribes. In 1837 the Indian Chief Solano received the Rancho Suisun Mexican land grant. This grant eventually came into the <b>hands</b> of a <b>clipper</b> ship captain from Fairfield, Connecticut named Robert H. Waterman. He not only parceled out the town in 1856, but also, in a commercially shrewd move, entered Fairfield in the race for Solano County seat in 1858, and won it from Benicia. As an inducement he granted 16 acre of land for the construction of county buildings. In 1903 Fairfield was incorporated as a city.|$|R
50|$|Thicker {{hair that}} wants to readily stand upright is ideal for a crew cut; with an {{appropriate}} head shape, a crew cut may be possible with fairly thin hair. When designing a crew cut, a barber follows the general sequence of other medium to short haircuts; edging, siding and topping. When designing a new crew cut and the current style is not relatively short, the hair on top or all over the head may initially be shortened with shears or clippers. Edging and siding together form a taper which usually is short, semi-short or medium. For a crew cut, some barbers perform edging and siding as one integrated process, regardless, the upper sides are initially boxed in and then cut to final form when designing the top. The hair {{on the top of}} the head can be styled clipper or shears over comb or free hand with a clipper.With the clipper or shears over comb method, the comb is inserted in the upright hair at the desired length and the hair is reduced to this length by means of clippers or shears severing the hair above the teeth of the comb. Free <b>hand</b> means the <b>clipper</b> blade or guard does not determine the cut hair length but rather the distance the cutting blade is held above the scalp sets the cut length.|$|R
