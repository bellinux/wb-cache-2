25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

Coghill said [...] "We tried to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> Elvis would, in a big band arrangement. There are backing vocals, horns and a la la sound." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? It felt good to have a song that I could express that in." ...|$|E

2500|$|During January 1998 Robert Hanks of The Independent {{compared}} the series' ethos {{to that of}} Star Trek. [...] He wrote [...] "If you wanted to sum up the relative position of Britain and America in this century – the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map, the fading of national self-confidence as Uncle Sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and Hollywood – you could <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> this: they had Star Trek, we had Blake's 7...No 'boldly going' here: instead, we got the boot stamping on a human face which George Orwell offered as a vision of humanity's future in Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Hanks concluded that [...] "Blake's 7 has acquired a credibility and popularity Terry Nation can never have expected...I think it's {{to do with the}} sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe: it is science-fiction for the disillusioned and ironic – and that is what makes it so very British." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1985, Burger King spent $40 {{million on}} the Where's Herb? {{advertising}} campaign. The campaign's premise was that Herb was {{the only man in}} America who had never eaten a Whopper. If a customer recognized him in any store, he or she would win US$5,000. The advertisements did not reveal Herb's appearance until the company's Super Bowl XX commercial, where Herb was revealed to be a bespectacled man in an ill-fitting suit. Herb toured stores across the country, appeared on The Today Show, and served as a guest timekeeper during WrestleMania 2. The campaign had little impact on sales and was quickly dropped. According to Advertising Age magazine, the Herb campaign was the [...] "most elaborate advertising flop of the decade." [...] Burger King's other 1980s advertising campaigns, such as [...] "This is a Burger King town", [...] "Fast food for fast times", and [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> you'd do it" [...] were barely more successful.|$|E

2500|$|At the Eminescu centennial, some eleven {{months before}} the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Doina was {{publicly}} quoted in Ceaușescu's own address. As noted by Slama-Cazacu, the message was read at the Romanian Atheneum by Emil Bobu, {{who happened to be}} [...] "one of [...] least cultured ministers." [...] The issue of Doina came up during long debates over the publication of Eminescu's complete works. The project was endorsed by philosopher Constantin Noica, who proposed putting out facsimiles from Eminescu's manuscripts. He acknowledged in 1977 that some were problematic for the regime, [...] "xenophobic, anti-Russian", and suggested to [...] "leave Doina out of it , we'll <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> type-writer girls—this we erase, the rest can appear." [...] In 1989, Ceaușescu ultimately allowed Creția to republish Doina in a lithographic edition which reproduced the Maiorescu original. According to Petre, this was originally planned as a regular-type edition, but Creția, who defended the inclusion of Doina, struggled with censorship for several years. During one episode of this exchange, he proposed changing [...] "from the Dniester to the Tisza" [...] to [...] "from the Istros to the Tisza", which excluded reference to Bessarabia; [...] "Dniester" [...] would only be clarified in the erratum.|$|E
2500|$|Rubber Soul was the group's first release not {{to feature}} their {{name on the}} cover, an {{uncommon}} tactic in 1965. The [...] "stretched" [...] effect of the cover photo came about after photographer Bob Freeman had taken some pictures of the group wearing suede leather jackets at Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, [...] "Ah! Can we have that? Can you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> that?", to which Freeman said he could. The distinctive lettering was created by photographer Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album's title: [...] "If you tap into a rubber tree then you get a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out." [...] The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to The Guardian, [...] "a staple of poster art for the flower power generation".|$|E

5000|$|Nobody <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> Me is a 1974 album by Shirley Bassey. Bassey's {{recordings}} {{had been}} selling well since 1970, scoring three top ten singles and three ten top albums. Nobody <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> Me was recorded {{with a new}} producer, George Butler, and brought a partial return to the traditional pop sound of Bassey's pre-1970s career. Here, the title track [...] "Nobody <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Like</b> Me" [...] and [...] "When You Smile" [...] harken back to the big band era. Bassey's soaring vocals on Paul Anka's [...] "I'm Not Anyone" [...] and the slightly funky [...] "Morning in Your Eyes" [...] contrast with a delicately rendered [...] "Davy". The duet [...] "Davy", recorded with the song's composer Benard Ighner, {{is one of the}} rare occasions that Bassey would share the credits with another vocalist; it was also issued as a single and hit #44 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. The album closes with Bassey's reading of Stevie Wonder's [...] "You Are the Sunshine of My Life". This album failed to chart in the UK, and peaked at #142 in the US. Her next two studio albums would be top 15 albums in the UK.|$|R
