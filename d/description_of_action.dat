Unforgiving Destiny - The Relentless Pursuit of a Black Marketeer (...) {{is dominated by the}} years in Baluchistan and Afghanistan, his dealings with Taliban as a friend is kidnapped, and his role as advisor to a tribal warlord. A contrast is made between the central Asian badlands and the high life when at the peak of McMillan’s smuggling success throughout Colombia, New York and Scandinavia. Of the latest book, McMillan says: “The challenge is to present the facts, real life, as part of readers’ own lives when, for me, the events were often felt as unrelenting terror. I suppose the fact I was up against implacable forces helped me - not in survival, of course, but in telling the story.” [...] He says the lengthy book is, “an attempt to fill in the important blanks, perhaps my last.” A link to the music of the period is online. [...] Recordings of the author narrating selections of the book are available. [...] Of this latest release, McMillan says, “I have tried to prune the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> to higher standards, but with biography, there's no dodging needed self-examination of motive.

His distinction of three neural excitability classes based on injected steps of currents and observed corresponding distinct frequency–current (f–I) curves still forms the basis in understanding bifurcation mechanisms of neural excitability. FitzHugh {{was the first to}} use dynamical systems techniques for the qualitative <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> potential generation and threshold phenomena [7, 8, 25].

40|$|Fresh tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consumed}} fruits and the preservation of its quality and shelf-life extension is a continuous challenge. An understanding of fruit deterioration factors allows the investigation of new approaches to reach this objective. Fruit preservation is achieved by destroying enzymes and micro-organisms, and reducing physiological disorders, using treatments such as chlorinated water (HIPO), ozone, low or high temperatures, ultrasounds, UV-C radiation, modified atmosphere packaging, edible coatings and 1 -methylcyclopropene.

The main points of computer processing of verbs of motion involve that the definitions are given as input to a system that produces an output that gives a grouping of the verbs and synthesized definitions of these verbs using primitives. In the system presented here the input action sequence is analyzed using the semantics of primitive motion verbs and the way they combine for the synthesis of complex verbs that summarize the action sequence. A future application of this work could be in the automatic text generation of descriptions of motion images obtained by artificial vision systems.

40|$|In the post-crisis era, new {{concepts}} are emerging, while some old and dysfunctional ones are being discarded. Strategy is about making series of decisions that drive corporate action under specific coupling with company's environment and context. Because decisions are actions, the strategy itself is action, {{not just a}} <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In the world of traditional strategy, descriptions (information) have replaced action (knowledge), and talk has replaced walk. We start from the premise that strategy is what company does, and what company does is its strategy. One cannot run a company just on descriptions and framed mission statements. The role of customers is crucial: the customer shapes strategy and triggers corporate action. Without respecting the customer, there is no viable strategy. This is why we label the action-based strategic thinking as "Anti-Porter": consumers do not want tradeoffs and thus truly effective strategy cannot be rooted in Porter's tradeoffs...|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{existing}} {{work on the}} use of default {{information to}} describe planning hierarchies in two ways. First, we present a completeness result showing that all hierarchical planners can be described using defaults. Second, we show that if the planning hierarchy is situation-dependent, the default description is likely to have substantial computational advantages over a more conventional approach. 1 Introduction There are a variety of arguments for planners that work declaratively instead of using a specialized <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> like that appearing in strips [3] or sipe [16]. One argument appearing in [9] is that declarative planners are best equipped to handle the ramification problem, since the description of actions with situation-dependent consequences is best handled inferentially. It is shown in [9] that attempting to deal with this problem by splitting actions into subtypes is equivalent to taking the deductive closure of the underlying declarative axioms and tha [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Since depth {{measuring}} devices for real-world scenarios became {{available in the}} recent past, the use of 3 d data now comes more in focus of human action recognition. Due to the increased amount of data {{it seems to be}} advisable to model the trajectory of every landmark in the context of all other landmarks which is commonly done by dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA. In this paper we present an approach to directly use the subspaces (i. e. their basis vectors) for extracting features and classification of actions instead of projecting the landmark data themselves. This yields a fixed-length <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> sequences disregarding the number of provided frames. We give a comparison of various global techniques for dimensionality reduction and analyze their suitability for our proposed scheme. Experiments performed on the CMU Motion Capture dataset show promising recognition rates as well as robustness in the presence of noise and incorrect detection of landmarks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a formal theory for describing actions in terminological knowledge bases, {{closely related to}} description logics. It deals in particular {{with the problem of}} adapting the subsumption/specialization relations and the definition of inheritance from the well-formulated notions for static object concepts to dynamic action concepts. The <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> concepts integrates a formal notation of preconditions and effects similar to STRIPS planning systems. The approach suggested here anchors action descriptions in the object-concept part of the taxonomy. Object-concepts, their attributes, and relations are integrated as parameters in action descriptions, and are used in precondition and effect formulae, which specify changes in the object-concept part of the taxonomy. The definition of action concepts and their extensional semantics is based on the view of actions as transformers between world states, where preconditions and effects describe constraints on world states. This view allows a definition of inheritance and the subsumption/specialization relation for action concepts in parallel to the respective definitions for object concepts. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{study was}} conducted to analyse design strategies and knowledge used in object-oriented software design. Eight professional programmers experienced with procedural programming languages and either experienced or not experienced in object-oriented design strategies related to two central aspects of the object-oriented paradigm: (1) associating actions, i. e., execution steps, of a complex plan to different objects and revising a complex plan, and (2) defining simple plans at different levels in the class hierarchy. As regards the development of complex plans elements attached to different objects, our results show that, for beginners in OOP, the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> objects and the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> are not always integrated in an early design phase, particularly for the declarative problem whereas, for the programmers experienced in OOP, the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> objects and the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> tend to be integrated in their first drafts of solutions whichever the problem type. The analysis of design strategies reveal the use of different knowledge according to subjects' language experience: (1) schemas related to procedural languages; actions are organized in an execution order, or (2) schemas related to object-oriented languages; actions and objects are integrated, and actions are organised around objects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- We present our {{contribution}} to a national project whose ambition is to use new cooperation tools, {{in the context of}} homecare, in order to facilitate the coordinated cooperative work of health actors. Homecare is expected to develop in the coming years, but it is still difficult to organize and such care coordination is complex. A study of homecare activity leads us to determine two specific sorts of activity: one concerns the implementation of human and material resources and design of the homecare protocol, and the other concerns the actual coordinated patient care. In this paper we focus on the needs which we have encountered in such a context: a workflow coordination is useful if the care is well protocoled, human decision is crucial in more unusual situations. We propose a model of coordination which is based on the three following concepts: recursive <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> flexible routing, common share of reference.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} systematic polysemy in Brazilian Portuguese deverbal nouns as {{a result}} of the meaning inherent to deverbal noun formation patterns, which underlies the meaning resulting from the use of those patterns in specific circumstances. Both denotative and grammatical functions are taken into account in the brief <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> agent and instrumental nouns derived from verbs in Brazilian Portuguese. The data show that, in spite of considerable meaning variation and partial unpredictability, deverbal nouns always maintain a basic meaning necessarily related to the deriving verb, which strongly points to systematic polysemy. In conclusion, the author argues that the situation of systematic polysemy in deverbal nouns derives from the efficiency of the lexicon as a dynamic storage system of symbolic forms for the purposes of language internal and external use. Tradicionalmente a polissemia é definida e entendida como um termo da oposição homonímia/polissemia, e em relação à prática lexicográfica.
