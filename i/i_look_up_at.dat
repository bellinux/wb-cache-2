6000|$|... "You {{know the}} bare rocky bluff {{that stands out}} {{prominently}} on the hill across the creek. From that spot Colonel Zane first saw the valley, and from there I leaped my horse. I can never convince myself that it really happened. Often <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that cliff in doubt. But the Indians and Colonel Zane, Jonathan, Wetzel and others say they actually saw the deed done, so I must accept it," [...] said Major McColloch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] said Charley. [...] "When father's black bull chased Kate {{and me in}} the prairies, {{and almost}} overtook us as we ran for the fence of the big field, I felt my heart leap to my mouth, and the blood rush to my cheeks, as I turned about and faced him, while Kate climbed the fence; but after she was over, I felt a wild sort of wickedness in me, as if I should like to tantalise and torment him,--and I felt {{altogether}} different from what I feel now while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> these black clouds. Isn't there something quite awful in them, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him to {{read the}} signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.|$|R
60|$|The {{rest of his}} remark was {{drowned out}} in a clap of thunder. Somewhat startled, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} hear it,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'Behold {{the wonders}} of the firmament, Mrs Lupin! how glorious is the scene! When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> those shining orbs, I think that each of them is winking to the other to take notice of the vanity of men's pursuits. My fellow-men!' cried Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head in pity; 'you are much mistaken; my wormy relatives, you are much deceived! The stars are {{perfectly}} contented (I suppose so) in their several spheres. Why are not you? Oh! do not strive and struggle to enrich yourselves, or to get the better of each other, my deluded friends, but look up there, with me!' ...|$|E
60|$|Each man's {{knife in}} its sheath in his girdle, {{loosened}} for dinner. As the first man, with a knowingly kindled eye, watches the filling of the poisoned chalice (truly {{but a very}} small tin mug, to be prosaic), and, tossing back his head, tosses the contents into himself, and passes the empty chalice and passes on, so the second man with an anticipatory wipe of his mouth on sleeve or handkerchief, bides his turn, and drinks and hands and passes on, in whom, and in each as his turn approaches, beams a knowingly kindled eye, a brighter temper, and a suddenly awakened tendency to be jocose with some shipmate. Nor do I even observe that {{the man in charge}} of the ship's lamps, who in right of his office has a double allowance of poisoned chalices, seems thereby vastly degraded, even though he empties the chalices into himself, one after the other, much as if he were delivering their contents at some absorbent establishment in which he had no personal interest. But vastly comforted, I note them all to be, on deck presently, even to the circulation of redder blood in their cold blue knuckles; and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> them lying out on the yards, and holding on for life among the beating sails, I cannot for MY life see the justice of visiting on them--or on me--the drunken crimes of any number of criminals arraigned at the heaviest of assizes.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wish you}} to watch these closely, judging them as a whole, and {{treating}} them as I have asked you, and favour me with your damnatory advice. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> your portrait, and it frowns upon me. You seem to view me with reproach. The expression is excellent; Fanny wept when she saw it, and you know she is not given to the melting mood. She seems really better; I have a touch of fever again, I fancy overwork, and to-day, when I have overtaken my letters, I shall blow on my pipe. Tell Mrs. S. I have been playing LE CHANT D'AMOUR lately, and have arranged it, after awful trouble, rather prettily for two pipes; and it brought her before me with an effect scarce short of hallucination. I could hear her voice in every note; yet I had forgot the air entirely, and began to pipe it from notes as something new, when I was brought up with a round turn by this reminiscence. We are now very much installed; the dining-room is done, and looks lovely. Soon we shall begin to photograph and send you our circumstances. [...] My room is still a howling wilderness. I sleep on a platform in a window, and strike my mosquito bar and roll up my bedclothes every morning, so that the bed becomes by day a divan. A great part of the floor is knee-deep in books, yet nearly all the shelves are filled, alas! It {{is a place to}} make a pig recoil, yet here are my interminable labours begun daily by lamp-light, and sometimes not yet done when the lamp has once more to be lighted. The effect of pictures in this place is surprising. They give great pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Miss Haldin in {{sympathetic}} consternation, but Miss Haldin {{was looking}} down calmly at her mother. The latter said-- ...|$|R

60|$|Here is our pew in the church. What a high-backed pew! With {{a window}} near it, {{out of which}} our house can be seen, and IS seen many times during the morning's service, by Peggotty, who likes to make herself as sure as she can that it's not being robbed, or is not in flames. But though Peggotty's eye wanders, she is much {{offended}} if mine does, and frowns to me, as I stand upon the seat, that I am {{to look at the}} clergyman. But I can't always look at him--I know him without that white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps stopping the service to inquire--and what am I to do? It's a dreadful thing to gape, but I must do something. I look at my mother, but she pretends not to see me. I look at a boy in the aisle, and he makes faces at me. I look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through the porch, and there I see a stray sheep--I don't mean a sinner, but mutton--half making up his mind to come into the church. I feel that if I looked at him any longer, I might be tempted to say something out loud; and what would become of me then! <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the monumental tablets on the wall, and try to think of Mr. Bodgers late of this parish, and what the feelings of Mrs. Bodgers must have been, when affliction sore, long time Mr. Bodgers bore, and physicians were in vain. I wonder whether they called in Mr. Chillip, and he was in vain; and if so, how he likes to be reminded of it once a week. I look from Mr. Chillip, in his Sunday neckcloth, to the pulpit; and think what a good place it would be to play in, and what a castle it would make, with another boy coming up the stairs to attack it, and having the velvet cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head. In time my eyes gradually shut up; and, from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a drowsy song in the heat, I hear nothing, until I fall off the seat with a crash, and am taken out, more dead than alive, by Peggotty.|$|E

5000|$|The tree is {{mentioned}} {{three times in}} Anne Frank's diary The Diary of a Young Girl. On 23 February 1944, she writes about the tree: [...] Ik ga haast elke ochtend naar de zolder waar Peter werkt om de bedompte kamerlucht uit mijn longen te laten waaien. Vanuit mijn lievelingsplekje op de grond kijk ik naar de blauwe hemel, naar de kale kastanjeboom aan wiens takken kleine druppeltjes schitteren, naar de meeuwen en de andere vogels, die in hun scheervlucht wel van zilver lijken. ... 'Zolang dit nog bestaat', dacht ik 'en ik het mag beleven, deze zonneschijn, die hemel waaraan geen wolk is, zolang kan ik niet treurig zijn'.Nearly every morning I go to the attic to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs, from my favorite spot on the floor <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind. ... As long as this exists, I thought, and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts I cannot be unhappy.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the little}} noise she made. [...] "TWICE!" [...] she said, smiling indulgently, [...] "to-day!" [...] (Even the smile was Altiora's.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. His good, homely {{face was}} close to mine, and in his eyes was an unmistakable look of love and tenderness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the big stone {{buildings}} before us. My {{father was}} behind those walls. I glanced at Kate. The poor girl was in tears.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} new talent Sullivan booked each week, he also had {{recurring}} characters appear many times a season, such as his [...] "Little Italian Mouse" [...] puppet sidekick Topo Gigio, who debuted December 9, 1962, and ventriloquist Señor Wences debuted December 31, 1950. While most of the episodes aired live from New York City, the show also aired live on occasion from other nations, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. For many years, Ed Sullivan was a national event each Sunday evening, {{and was the first}} exposure for foreign performers to the American public.On the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA): The chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days, we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then, each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days I talked too much. Watching these kines I cringe. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me talking away and I say [...] "You fool! Keep quiet!" [...] But I just keep on talking. I've learned how to keep my mouth shut.|$|E
40|$|As I {{am sitting}} {{at my desk}} {{thinking}} {{of what it is}} that I want to divulge myself in this semester for my Rhet 105 class <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my wall and notice a poster for the movie “The Boondock Saints”. The byline on the poster reads “Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done. ” As I read this, I start to think about God and religion and a thought pops into my head. Atheism. Walking through the quad on Quad Day, my friends and I passed a booth that had a large sign saying: “Atheist Club”. I thought nothing of it until now, and the fact that John said that the less you know about the subject you are studying; the better the project will turn out. So the question is: “So what? ” What am I going to do get involved with the Atheist club? Is the Atheist club too extreme? What if I actually agree with what they’re saying? These are all questions that I asked myself the moment I thought of the Atheists. As a member of the Irish Catholic community, I have been brought up with the ideals that God is the almighty power, {{and that there is a}} heaven and a hell. From what I understand about Atheists is that they believe in nothing, and that there is no higher power, which goes against everything that I’ve been raised with. Overall, I feel that getting involved in the Atheist community on campus would open my eyes, and possibly others, to a whole new world that many people do not understand...|$|E
40|$|Tracy, {{come over}} here, read this [...] . ’, {{one of the}} {{students}} calls me over, continuing ‘It’s so sad’. Her gaze holds mine as she speaks, gauging my reaction. When she sees she has my attention, she points to a display cabinet in front of us. I look down and see medals, laid out with an explanatory note from the author, a famous book illustrator. I read the words, ‘In memory of my uncles, who died in the Great War. ’ <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the student as she whispers to me, ‘They were so young, they were our age. ’ Her voice tails off into a shared silent space that words cannot fill, yet is over-spilling with emotion… (to be continued). This article brings together reflections from both professional and personal perspectives, to address the interdisciplinary potential of storytelling, both as an approach to teaching and research, and as a means for communication. I do all that and more, by focusing on the particularities within an experience that was professional, personal and emotional. I share this with you in story form and, in the method advocated by Hustedde and King, invite you to slow down your mind and let my words sink beneath your skin, so that you reflect on the meanings of your own experiences. The ellipsis points are placed purposefully at the end of five sentences within the story to signify transition points at which to pause and focus the conversation. This is an evocative methodological approach I have adopted for my most treasured encounters, which I refer to as ‘magic moments’. I interpret these through creative non-fiction, taking great care to critically analyse each moment, to extract meaning and avoid it being merely ‘a nice story’. It is so much more than that...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her; {{she did not}} ask me what I {{had been}} {{thinking}} about nor remark upon my silence. She, too, had been wrapped in revery; her face was grave. She raised her arms from the wall and stood up.|$|R
