We employ litigation data on patents, copyrights, and trademarks to study overlapping <b>IP</b> <b>protections</b> used by software firms. While prior research, {{as well as}} the policy debate, has tended to view different types of IP as substitutes, we propose conditions under which they can act as complements.

Using newly available data from China, this study confirms the nurturing role of financial systems on innovations, the value-enhancing function of firms' innovative activities, and the lead-lag predictive role of innovations on stock returns, in the context of emerging economies. More importantly, the study documents that stronger provincial <b>IP</b> <b>protections</b> reduce patent piracy and hence enhance local firms' market values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} (IP) core based {{embedded systems}} design is a pervasive {{practice in the}} semiconductor industry due to shorter time-to-market and tougher cost competitions. Protecting the design information in these IP cores and securing test from various attacks are two emerging challenges in today's embedded systems design. Recently reported techniques address these challenges considering secure test and <b>IP</b> core <b>protection</b> separately. However, for ensuring high security during IP core functionality and also during test, joint consideration of secure test and <b>IP</b> core <b>protection</b> is much needed. In this paper, we propose a novel and unified design methodology, called STEP (Secure TEst and <b>IP</b> core <b>Protection),</b> which addresses the joint objective of secure test and <b>IP</b> core <b>protection.</b> The aim of STEP design methodology is to achieve high security at low system cost using the same key integrated hardware during test and IP core functionality. We {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} STEP design methodology considering advanced encryption standard (AES) system as a case study. We show that proposed design methodology benefits from high security and test accuracy, requiring up to 9 % higher area and 20 % power overhead...|$|R

40|$|On-chip {{security}} is an emerging {{challenge in the}} design of embedded systems with intellectual property (IP) cores. Traditionally this challenge is addressed using ad hoc design techniques with separate design objectives of secure design for testability (DfT), and <b>IP</b> core <b>protection.</b> However, in this paper, we will argue that such design approaches can incur high costs. Underpinning this argument, we propose a novel design methodology, called Secure TEst and <b>IP</b> core <b>Protection</b> (STEP), which aims to address the joint objective of <b>IP</b> core <b>protection</b> and secure testing. To ensure that this objective is achieved at a low cost, the STEP design methodology employs common key integrated hardware. This hardware is incorporated in the system through an automated design conversion technique, which can be easily merged into the electronic design automation (EDA) tool chain. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed design methodology considering various implementations of advanced encryption standard (AES) systems as case studies. We show that our proposed design methodology benefits from design automation with high security, and protection at the cost of low area, and power consumption overheads, when compared with traditional design methodologies...|$|R

40|$|Activation of ATP-dependent {{potassium}} channels (KATP) {{is involved}} in ischaemic preconditioning (IP). In isolated buffer-perfused rabbit hearts, activation of mitochondrial KATP – through a generation of free radicals – acted as a trigger rather than a mediator of IP; the isolated buffer-perfused heart preparation, however, favours free radical generation. In contrast, in vivo studies in rats and dogs suggested that activation of KATP acts as a mediator of <b>IP's</b> <b>protection.</b> A detailed analysis {{on the role of}} KATP in <b>IP's</b> <b>protection</b> in vivo by varying the time and dose of KATP blocker administration is, however, lacking. In 54 enflurane-anaesthetized pigs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused by an extracorporeal circuit. Infarct size (IS, %, TTC) following 90 min sustained low-flow ischaemia and 120 min reperfusion was 26. 6 ± 3. 5 (s. e. m.) (n= 8). IP with one cycle of 10 min ischaemia and 15 min reperfusion reduced IS to 6. 5 ± 2. 1 (n= 7, P< 0. 05). Blockade of KATP with glibenclamide (0. 5 mg kg− 1 i. v., 50 μg min− 1 continuous infusion) starting 10 min before or immediately following the preconditioning ischaemia abolished IS reduction by IP (20. 7 ± 2. 7, n= 7 and 21. 9 ± 6. 6, n= 6, respectively) while having no effect on IS per se (22. 2 ± 5. 2, n= 7), supporting a trigger role of KATP in IP. In contrast, starting glibenclamide following the preconditioning ischaemia 10 min prior to the sustained ischaemia did not prevent IS reduction by IP (3. 7 ± 2. 3, n= 6), even when its bolus dose was increased to 1. 5 mg kg− 1 (26. 6 ± 3. 8 with IP vs 37. 5 ± 2. 9 without IP; n= 7 and 6 respectively, P< 0. 05), thereby refuting a mediator role of KATP in IP. In conclusion, activation of KATP in the immediate reperfusion following the preconditioning ischaemia is pivotal for triggering IP...|$|R

40|$|Countries have {{different}} levels of intellectual property (<b>IP)</b> <b>protections.</b> While developed countries tend to prefer more stringent IP laws, developing countries prefer weaker ones. With {{the enactment of the}} Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which established minimum standards of intellectual property rights (IPRs) for states party, the level of IPRs became much higher globally. However, despite affording strong protection to many types of IP, this Comment argues that TRIPS fails to provide adequate protection for traditional cultural marks (TCMs), particularly those used in developing countries. As a result, companies in developed countries have been able to steal TCMs from developing countries without violating TRIPS or other international law. This Comment uses as an example the attempted registration by a UK company of the word kikoi, the term for a traditional East African skirt, to demonstrate that TRIPS fails to protect this type of IP. With a focus on trademarks and geographical indications this Comment analyzes TRIPS and other laws in the context of traditional marks and argues that current international law is inadequate for the protection of traditional marks. It then discusses proposals to protect traditional IP and introduces a simple solution to the IP theft of traditional cultural marks...|$|R
