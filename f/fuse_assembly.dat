50|$|The use of add-on spaced armor skirts on armored {{vehicles}} {{may have the}} opposite effect and actually increase the penetration of some shaped charge warheads. Due to constraints in {{the length of the}} projectile/missile, the built-in stand-off on many warheads is less than the optimum distance. In such cases, the skirting effectively increases the distance between the armor and the target, and the warhead detonates closer to its optimum standoff. Skirting {{should not be confused with}} cage armor which is used to damage the fusing system of RPG-7 projectiles. The armor works by deforming the inner and outer ogives and shorting the firing circuit between the rocket's piezoelectric nose probe and rear <b>fuse</b> <b>assembly.</b> Cage armor can also cause the projectile to pitch up or down on impact, lengthening the penetration path for the shaped charge's penetration stream.

40|$|Looks can be deceiving. Although peroxisomes {{appear to}} be simple organelles, their {{formation}} and maintenance pose unique challenges for the cell. The birth of new peroxisomes starts at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which delivers lipids and membrane proteins. To form a new peroxisomal compartment, ER-derived preperoxisomal vesicles carrying different membrane proteins <b>fuse,</b> allowing the <b>assembly</b> of the peroxisomal translocon. To complete formation, peroxisomes import their soluble proteins directly from the cytosol using the newly assembled translocon. Together with the ER-derived biogenic route, peroxisomal fission and segregation subsequently maintain the cellular peroxisome population. In this review we highlight the latest insights on {{the life cycle of}} peroxisomes and show how the new cell biology concept of peroxisome formation affects our thinking about peroxisome-related diseases and their evolutionary past.

40|$|This study {{confirms}} {{and extends}} previous {{work on the}} lateral cilia of the fresh-water mussel, Elliptio complanatus, {{in support of a}} "sliding filament" mechanism of ciliary motility wherein peripheral filaments (microtubules) do not change length during beat (see Satir, 1967). Short sequences of serial sections of tips are examined in control (nonbeating) and activated (metachronal wave) preparations. Several different tip types, functional rather than morphogenetic variants, are demonstrated, but similarly bent cilia have similar tips. The peripheral filaments are composed of two subfibers: a and b. The bent regions of cilia are in the form of circular arcs, and apparent differences in subfiber-b length at the tip are those predicted solely by geometry of the stroke without the necessity of assuming filament contraction. Various subfibers b apparently move with respect to one another during beat, since small systematic variations in relative position can be detected from cilium to cilium. While subfiber-b lengths are uniform throughout, subfiber-a lengths are morphologically different for each filament: 8 and 3 are about 0. 8 µ longer than 1, 4 and 5, but each unique length is independent of stroke position or tip type. Subfiber-a does not contract, nor does it move, e. g. slide, with respect to subfiber-b of the same doublet. The central pair of filaments extends to the tip of the cilium where its members <b>fuse.</b> Subunit <b>assembly</b> in ciliary microtubules is evidently precise.

40|$|The beta-amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) {{plays a major}} role in Alzheimer's disease. The APP intracellular domain (AICD), together with Fe 65 and Tip 60, localizes to spherical nuclear AFT complexes, which may represent sites of transcription. Despite a lack of co-localization with several described nuclear compartments, we have identified a close apposition between AFT complexes and splicing speckles, Cajal bodies and PML bodies. Live imaging revealed that AFT complexes were highly mobile within nuclei and following pharmacological inhibition of transcription <b>fused</b> into larger <b>assemblies.</b> We have previously shown that AICD regulates the expression of its own precursor APP. In support of our earlier findings, transfection of APP promoter plasmids as substrates resulted in cytosolic AFT complex formation at labeled APP promoter plasmids. In addition, identification of chromosomal APP or KAI 1 gene loci by fluorescence in situ hybridization showed their close association with nuclear AFT complexes. The transcriptional activator Notch intracellular domain (NICD) localized to the same nuclear spots as occupied by AFT complexes suggesting that these nuclear compartments correspond to transcription factories.

40|$|Cluster {{formation}} of E-cadherin {{on the cell}} surface {{is believed to be}} of major importance for cell-cell adhesion. To mimic this process the extracellular part of mouse E-cadherin (ECAD) was recombinantly <b>fused</b> to the <b>assembly</b> domain of rat cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), resulting in the chimeric protein ECAD-COMP. The COMP domain formed a five-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil. This enabled the {{formation of}} a pentameric ECAD with bundled C-termini and free N-termini. The pentameric protein construct ECAD-COMP and the monomeric ECAD were expressed in human embryonal kidney 293 cells. Electron microscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, solid phase binding and cell attachment assays revealed that pentamers showed strong self-association and cell attachment, whereas monomers exhibited no activity. At the high internal concentration in the pentamer the N-terminal EC 1 domains of two E-cadherin arms interact to form a ring-like structure. Then the paired domains interact with a corresponding pair from another pentamer. None of the four other extracellular domains of E-cadherin is involved in this interaction. Based on these results, an in vivo mechanism is proposed whereby two N-terminal domains of neighbouring E-cadherins at the cell surface first form a pair, which binds with high affinity to a similar complex on another cell. The strong dependence of homophilic interactions on C-terminal clustering points towards a regulation of E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion via lateral association...|$|R
40|$|Rationale Fast {{increase}} of world population {{leads to a}} correlative increase on wood demand (heating, pulp and paper, building). Consequently, the cultivated forest has a leading role to play to fill this growing demand. Developing an abundant wood ressource calls for improvement of sylvicultural practices as well as deployment of genetically improved trees varieties {{in the frame of}} a sustainable forestry. Maintaining french forest competitivity will depend on the integration of new technologies in breeding programs, especially for intensively cultivated forest species such as maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Second generation sequencing platforms provide tremendous and relatively cheap amounts of data to biologists. However, the main characteristic of this data is to be extremely puzzled with about 20 millions of short sequences averaging 100 bp length per sample. Aligning such data along a reference genome is a routine task nowadays. But in the case of maritime pine, de novo assembling of a transcriptome (i. e. without reference genome) from the 300 millions of sequences available, mixing 1 % of Sanger and 454 long sequences and 99 % of such short reads, is quite challenging and calls for delicate algorithmic approaches (Wall et al. 2009). Nevertheless, applying short sequences to transcriptomics is already possible (Wheat 2010) using for instance informations provided by orthologous genes (Birzele et al. 2010) and promises to be an acceptable experimental solution for many non-model agronomical species. Many different algorithms for transcriptome assembly are available (Miller et al. 2010, Surget-Groba & Montoya-Burgos 2010). Kumar & Blaxter (2010) compared CAP 3, MIRA 3, Newbler, SeqMan and CLC for the de novo assembly of Litomosoides sigmodontis nematode transcriptome. In the latter paper, an interesting idea was to <b>fuse</b> different <b>assemblies</b> to maximise cooperation of different algorithms in the final assembly. Aims In this poster, we will describe a preliminary assembly of 454 sequences by TGICL (Pertea et al. 2003) and we propose to study the usability of several tools of transcriptome assembly, such as MIRA 3 (Chevreux et al. 2004), Velvet (Zerbino & Birney 2008), ABySS (Birol et al. 2009) and SOAPdeNovo (Li et al. 2010), integrating massive short reads, and define an acceptable method to apply to maritime pine transcriptomics...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} is a Gram-positive anaerobic pathogen {{which causes}} many diseases in humans and animals. While some genetic tools exist {{for working with}} C. perfringens, a tightly regulated, inducible promoter system is currently lacking. Therefore, we constructed a plasmid-based promoter system that provided regulated expression when lactose was added. This plasmid (pKRAH 1) is an Escherichia coli-C. perfringens shuttle vector containing the gene encoding a transcriptional regulator, BgaR, and a divergent promoter upstream of gene bgaL (bgaR-PbgaL). To measure transcription at the bgaL promoter in pKRAH 1, the E. coli reporter gene gusA, encoding β-glucuronidase, was placed downstream of the PbgaL promoter to make plasmid pAH 2. When transformed into three strains of C. perfringens, pAH 2 exhibited lactose-inducible expression. C. perfringens strain 13, a commonly studied strain, has endogenous β-glucuronidase activity. We mutated gene bglR, encoding a putative β-glucuronidase, and observed an 89 % decrease in endogenous activity with no lactose. This combination of a system for regulated gene expression and a mutant of strain 13 with low β-glucuronidase activity are useful tools for studying gene regulation and protein expression in an important pathogenic bacterium. We used this system to express the yfp-pilB gene, comprised of a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) -encoding gene <b>fused</b> to an <b>assembly</b> ATPase gene involved in type IV pilus-dependent gliding motility in C. perfringens.
