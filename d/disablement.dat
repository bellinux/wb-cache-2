40|$|We {{surveyed}} the sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome (strain S 288 C) comprehensively for open reading frames (ORFs) that could encode full-length proteins but contain obvious mid-sequence <b>disablements</b> (frameshifts or premature stop codons). These pseudogenic features are termed disabled ORFs (dORFs). Using homology to annotated yeast ORFs and non-yeast proteins plus a simple region extension procedure, {{we have found}} 183 dORFs. Combined with the 38 existing annotations for potential dORFs, we have a total pool of up to 221 dORFs, corresponding to less than 3 % of the proteome. Additionally, we found 20 pairs of annotated ORFs for yeast that could be merged into a single ORF (termed a mORF) by read-through of the intervening stop codon, and may comprise a complete ORF in other yeast strains. Focussing on a core pool of 98 dORFs with a verifying protein homology, we ®nd that most dORFs are substantially decayed, with 90 % having two or more <b>disablements,</b> and 60 % having four or more. dORFs are much mor...|$|R

Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement.

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of highway incident duration has become an increasingly import research topic due to the impact that highway incidents (vehicle accidents and <b>disablements)</b> have on traffic congestion. In addition, {{there is a growing}} need to evaluate incident management programs that seek to reduce incident duration and incident-induced traffic congestion. We apply hazard-based duration models to statistically evaluate the time it takes detect/report, respond to, and clear incidents. Two-year data from Washington State's incident response team program were used to estimate the hazard models. The model estimation results show that a wide variety of factors significantly affect incident times (i. e. detection/reporting, response, and clearance times), and that different distributional assumptions for the hazard function are appropriate for the different incident times being considered. It was also found that the estimated coefficients were not stable between the two years of data used in model estimation. The findings of this paper provide an important demonstration of method and an empirical basis to assess incident management programs. ...|$|R

In rodents, around 40 PTP-ases have been described. Functional orthologue {{for each of these}} PTP-ases have been identified in human, except for OST-PTP. OST-PTP is a transmembrane PTP-ase with a restricted tissue distribution.

Using RT-PCR we isolated a 4 kb hOST-PTP transcript. hOST-PTP cDNA sequence exhibits numerous <b>disablements</b> indicating that it does not code for a PTP-ase but is rather a pseudogene with unique features. Indeed, (i) it has no "functional" parent in the human genome, (ii) it has retained an "intron-exon" structure, and (iii) it is transcribed in a regulated manner. Interestingly, we found two ESTs, from domesticated pig and from cow that exhibit ORF that would predict a functional OST-PTP orthologue in Artiodactyls.

40|$|Based on {{searches}} for disabled homologs to known proteins, {{we have identified}} a large population of pseudogenes in four sequenced eukaryotic genomes- the worm, yeast, fly and human (chromosomes 21 and 22 only).

Here, we perform a comprehensive survey of the amino acid and nucleotide composition of these pseudogenes in comparison to that of functional genes and intergenic DNA. We show that pseudogenes invariably have an amino-acid composition intermediate between genes and translated intergenic DNA. Although the degree of intermediacy varies among the four organisms, in all cases, it is most evident for amino-acid types that differ most in occurrence between genes and intergenic regions. The same intermediacy also applies to codon frequencies, especially in the worm and human. Moreover, the intermediate composition of pseudogenes applies even though the composition of the genes in the four organisms is markedly different, showing a strong correlation with the overall A/T content of the genomic sequence.

We search human genomic DNA for regions {{that are similar to}} known protein sequences and contain obvious <b>disablements</b> (i. e., mid-sequence stop codons or frameshifts), while ensuring minimal overlap with annotations of known genes. Pseudogenes can be divided into “processed ” and “nonprocessed”; the former are reverse transcribed from mRNA (and therefore have no intron structure), whereas the latter presumably arise from genomic duplications. We annotate putative processed pseudogenes based on whether there is a continuous span of homology that is> 70 % of the length of the closest matching human protein (i. e., with introns removed), or whether there is evidence of polyadenylation. We have applied our approach to chromosomes 21 and 22, the first parts of the human genome completely sequenced, finding 190 new pseudogene annotations beyond the 264 reported by the sequencing centers.
