40|$|The {{performance}} of two externally blown flap (EBF) wind tunnel models was {{compared with an}} engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>flap</b> impingement correlation parameter. One model was a four engine EBF triple slotted flap transport. Isolated engine wake surveys were conducted to define the wake properties of five separate engine configurations for which performance data were available. The other model was a two engine EBF transport for which the engine wake properties were estimated. The correlation parameter was a function of engine exhaust dynamic pressure at the flap location, area of engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>flap</b> impingement, total exhaust area at the flap location, and engine thrust. The distribution of dynamic pressure for the first model was measured; however, the distribution for the second model {{was assumed to be}} uniform...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{stringent}} emission {{regulations are}} pushing towards new air management strategies like LP-EGR and HP/LP mix both for passenger car and heavy duty applications, increasing the engine control complexity. Within {{a project in}} collaboration between Kohler Engines EMEA, Politecnico di Torino, Ricardo and Denso to exploit the potential of EGR-Only technologies, a 3. 4 liters KDI 3404 was equipped with a two stage turbocharging system, an extremely high pressure FIS and a low pressure EGR system. The LP-EGR system works in a closed loop control with an intake oxygen sensor actuating two valves: an EGR valve placed downstream of the EGR cooler that regulates the flow area of the bypass between the exhaust line and the intake line, and an <b>exhaust</b> <b>flap</b> to generate enough backpressure to recirculate the needed EGR rate to cut the NOx emission without a specific aftertreatment device. In this paper it will be demonstrated how, using a 1 D-CFD code to characterize the flow in the exhaust line and in the EGR pathway, together with simple physical correlations, {{it is possible to}} define the opening laws of the two valves in order to both obtain a linear response of the EGR control and minimize the fuel consumption increase due to the backpressure valve...|$|E

50|$|Another {{approach}} {{is to use the}} airflow from the engines directly, by placing a flap so that it deploys into the path of the <b>exhaust.</b> Such <b>flaps</b> require greater strength due to the power of modern engines and also greater heat resistance to the hot exhaust. The effect can be significant. Examples include the C-17 Globemaster III.|$|R

It is common, particularly in rural areas, to customise utes in the [...] "B&S style" [...] with bullbars, spotlights, oversized mudflaps, <b>exhaust</b> pipe <b>flaps</b> and UHF aerials. The ute culture has been romanticised by country singers such as Lee Kernaghan, who has written odes to the ute such as She's My Ute, Scrubbabashin, Baptise The Ute and Love Shack.|$|R

40|$|A highly {{suppressed}} TF- 34 {{engine was}} used to investigate engine and flap interaction noise associated with an externally blown flap STOL powered lift system. Noise, efficiency, and velocity decay characteristics of mixed and separate flow exhaust systems including convergent, co-annular, and lobed designs were determined with the engine operating alone. Noise data were then obtained for several of the exhaust configurations with the engine blowing a wing-flap segment. Noise for both the engine alone and the engine with blown flaps showed substantial differences for the various exhaust configurations tested. The differences in observed noise are related primarily to nozzle effective <b>exhaust</b> velocity, <b>flap</b> impingement velocity, and noise spectral shape...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an {{upper surface blowing flap}} system that would augment lift. The model had a 25 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 89 and two turbofan engines with the engine centerline located at 0. 256 of the wing semispan. The lift of the flap system was augmented by turbofan exhaust impingement on the Coanda surface. Results were obtained for several flap deflections and engine nozzle configurations at jet momentum coefficients from 0 to 4. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with two engines operating. Limited longitudinal and lateral data are presented with an engine out.

40|$|Abstract. The {{externally}} {{blown flap}} (EBF) is an approach of powered lift technology utilizing conventional wing mounted engines to blow <b>exhaust</b> over the <b>flaps</b> surfaces. Based upon the multi-block point-matched structured grid generation techniques, three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational {{analysis of a}} high-lift configuration with and without externally blown flap jet effects is conducted in this study. Insights on the changes of the space flow characteristics around the flaps, the surface pressure distributions {{as well as the}} aerodynamic forces are presented. The predictive capability of the RANS method for powered lift characteristics is assessed...|$|R
40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for predicting externally blown flap (EBF) noise and turbomachinery strut noise. Noise radiated by under-the-wing and upper-surface-blowing EBF configurations is calculated as a sum of lift dipole noise, trailing edge noise, and jet quadrupole noise. Resulting predictions of amplitudes and spectra generally were in good agreement {{with data from}} small-scale models. These data cover a range of <b>exhaust</b> velocity, <b>flap</b> deflection, <b>exhaust</b> nozzle position, exhaust nozzle shape, and ratio of exhaust nozzle diameter to wing chord. A semi-empirical method for predicting dipole noise radiation from a strut with incident turbulence was in good agreement with data. Leading-edge regions made of perforated plate backed by a bulk acoustic absorber achieved up to 7 db reduction of strut noise caused by incident turbulence at high frequencies. Radial turbulence in a turbofan exit duct {{was found to have}} a relatively high level associated with the mean velocity defect in the rotor blade wakes. Use of these turbulence spectra and a dipole noise radiation equation gave general prediction of measured aft-radiated sound power caused by a splitter ring in a full-scale fan exit duct...|$|R
50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or <b>exhaust</b> {{over the}} <b>flaps</b> to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{powered lift}} systems {{currently}} {{being considered for}} use on STOL vehicles obtains additional lift by impinging the flow of a jet <b>exhaust</b> on the <b>flaps</b> and turning it downward. This direct impingement subjects {{large areas of the}} flap to the fluctuating pressure loads of the turbulent jet flow; these loads have the potential for causing high vibration levels and sonic fatigue failures. A test was conducted on a full-scale mockup of an externally blown flap system, which consisted of a TF- 34 engine and a section of a wing having a triple-slotted flap. Data were obtained and evaluated on the fluctuating pressures on the flaps and it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to present some of the results describing the loads...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{near field}} data were {{collected}} with model single and twin jet nozzles to determine if closely spaced nozzles produce higher acoustic loading than do single nozzles. The tests were spurred by structural failure of the B- 1 <b>exhaust</b> nozzle external <b>flaps</b> and similar damage on the F- 15. The test was performed using two 5 / 8 in. ID pipes machined and placed side-by-side to mimic B- 1 nozzles. A microphone mounted on the internozzle fairing measured acoustic levels near the nozzle exit plane. The nozzles oscillated significantly more than did a single nozzle {{over a wide range}} of nozzle pressure ratios. Acoustic levels in the dual jets exceeded single jet noise by as much as 20 dB, making acoustic resonance a definite candidate for structural damage in the twin jet configuration...|$|R
40|$|A {{fabrication}} feasibility demonstration component for the Enabling Propulsion Materials (EPM) {{program was}} evaluated under prototypical engine loading {{conditions at the}} Structural Benchmark Test Facility at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The purpose for this test was to verify EPM casting, joining, coating, and life-prediction methods. Electron beam welding techniques developed in the EPM program were used to join two large superalloy cast sections of an <b>exhaust</b> nozzle <b>flap</b> to fabricate the demonstration component. After the joints were inspected, the component was coated with an oxidation-resistant barrier coating and was sent to Lewis for testing. The special test fixture shown in the photo (the Structural Benchmark Test Facility) was designed and built at Lewis to produce a biaxial bending condition similar to the loading condition this part would encounter during engine operation. Several finite element {{analyses were conducted to}} validate the mechanical test method. A floating furnace was then designed to provide prototypical thermal profiles in the component. An isothermal low-cycle fatigue test was used to evaluate the component at a cyclic load of 13 kN (maximum) to 1 kN (minimum) at a frequency of 1 Hz. Component failure was defined as a 30 -percent increase in the component's compliance. On the basis of this definition, the low-cycle fatigue life of this component would be 35, 000 cycles...|$|R
40|$|At DASA, {{computational}} grids using monoblock structures {{have been}} in high favour since {{more than a decade}} and reached nowadays a great level of maturity. In fact complex 3 D-configurations with intake, <b>exhaust,</b> gaps, fairings, <b>flaps</b> deflected and external stores are handled by this technique without special efforts. Different types of elliptical generators can be activated in order to resolve such meshes within H" 3 -topologies. 'Smart grids' have been direectly derived from these codes in order to simplify and to generalize the postprocessing efforts. Within such a 'smart grid', each node has beyond its normal indexed address a set of additional attributes for a more precise identification of its location and properties within the grid. So it can be easily assigned to the surface, to the outer boundary, to the interior body or flowfield or as close-to-the-surface point. Such an identification system is not only indispensable for quick postprocessors but also for setting up an effective grid overlapping technique. This technique, called DOG, is similar to the 'chimera' principle and is universally applicable to any type of time dependent problems. Such applications will be shown for external store problems, especially highlighting the great advantages of this approach. (orig.)

40|$|Methods {{developed}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center for predicting the noise contributions from various aircraft noise sources have been incorporated into a computer program for predicting aircraft noise levels either in flight or in ground test. The noise sources accounted for include fan inlet and <b>exhaust,</b> jet, <b>flap</b> (for powered lift), core (combustor), turbine, and airframe. Noise propagation corrections {{are available in the}} program for atmospheric attenuation, ground reflections, extra ground attenuation, and shielding. The capacity to solve the geometrical relationships between an aircraft in flight and an observer on the ground has been included in the program to make it useful in evaluating noise estimates and footprints for various proposed engine installations. The program contains two main routines for employing the noise prediction routines. The first main routine consists of a procedure to calculate at various observer stations the time history of the noise from an aircraft flying at a specified set of speeds, orientations, and space coordinates. The various components of the noise are computed by the program. For each individual source, the noise levels are free field with no corrections for propagation losses other than spherical divergence. The total spectra may then be corrected for the usual effects of atmospheric attenuation, extra ground attenuation, ground reflection, and aircraft shielding. Next, the corresponding values of overall sound pressure level, perceived noise level, and tone-weighted perceived noise level are calculated. From the time history at each point, true effective perceived noise levels are calculated. Thus, values of effective perceived noise levels, maximum perceived noise levels, and tone-weighted perceived noise levels are found for a grid of specified points on the ground. The second main routine is designed to give the usual format of one-third octave sound pressure level values at a fixed radius for a number of user-selected angles, such as would simulate the ground acoustic testing of an engine. This computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 360 series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 120 K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed in 1981...|$|R
40|$|The flow/acoustic {{environment}} surrounding {{an engine}} nozzle installed on an airplane, say, under the wing, is asymmetric {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and {{the interaction of the}} <b>exhaust</b> jet with <b>flaps</b> on the wing. However, the conventional chevrons, which are azimuthally uniform serrations on the nozzle lip, do not exploit the asymmetry due to these propulsion airframe aeroacoustic interactions to reduce jet noise. In this pioneering study we use this non-axisymmetry to our advantage and examine if the total jet-related noise radiated to the ground can be reduced by using different types of azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) which vary the mixing around the nozzle periphery. Several scale models of the isolated nozzle, representative of high bypass ratio engine nozzles, were made with a pylon and azimuthally varying chevrons on both fan and core nozzles to enhance mixing at the top (near the pylon) with less mixing at the bottom (away from the pylon) or vice versa. Various combinations of fan and core AVC nozzles were systematically tested at typical take-off conditions inside a free jet wind-tunnel and, here, in Part 1 we analyze the acoustics results for the isolated nozzle with a pylon, with installation effects reported in Parts 2 and 3. Several interesting results are discovered: amongst the fan AVCs the top-enhanced mixing T-fan chevron nozzle is quieter in combination with any core AVC nozzle when compared to conventional chevrons; however, the bottom-mixing B-fan chevrons, as well as the core AVC nozzles, by themselves, are noisier. Further, the low-frequency source strengths in the jet plume, obtained via phased microphone arrays, also corroborate the far field sound, and for the T-fan chevrons such sources move further downstream than those for baseline or conventional chevron nozzles...|$|R
