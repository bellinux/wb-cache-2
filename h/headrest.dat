5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her <b>headrest.</b> Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a <b>headrest</b> stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his <b>headrest,</b> which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E

5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} <b>headrest</b> faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
25|$|In an automobile, the <b>headrest</b> or head {{restraint}} is a device {{attached to the}} top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most headrests are cushioned for comfort, are height adjustable and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile <b>headrest</b> was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the <b>headrest</b> was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.|$|E

25|$|On {{the various}} aircraft, economy seats also have USB, iPod and power connections, a cup-holder and trinket tray, and a <b>headrest</b> {{designed}} to allow a special sleep pillow to attach to it, preventing it from slipping downwards during sleep.|$|E
25|$|The right-front {{wheel and}} {{suspension}} {{are believed to}} have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna {{on the right side of}} his helmet, forcing his head back against the <b>headrest.</b> In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a tie rod, penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} featured raised seating in {{the second}} row, a hard point on the passenger’s side of the center console to provide support {{for a range of}} optional accessories (e.g., an optional shopping bag holder), rear-seat table, waste basket and cargo net integrated into the rear seat backs. Standard interior features included a coat hook integrated {{into the side of the}} front passenger's <b>headrest,</b> glove compartment with pen holder and toll card, configurable center console and rear seating with a two position backrests — one position favoring cargo and the other favoring comfort.|$|E
25|$|At mid-year a sunroof option became {{available}} on two-door models. Also, the optional Strato bucket seats available on coupes switched {{from the previous}} low-back design with adjustable <b>headrests</b> to the high back units with built-in <b>headrests</b> introduced the previous year on Camaros and Vegas. Despite the lack of change, Nova had its best sales season in years, with production of the 1972 models reaching 349,733. Of these, 139,769 had the six-cylinder engine.|$|R
50|$|From May 1975 {{overdrive}} and {{tinted glass}} were standard. In addition, all Sprints were fitted with body side trims, a plastic surround for the gearlever, and a driver's door mirror. <b>Headrests</b> were now available as an optional extra. From March 1976 <b>headrests,</b> a radio, and laminated windscreen were standard.

25|$|The latest {{redesign}} of the Economy Class seat was unveiled on 9 July 2013 alongside new first and business class products. Features include increased legroom, slimmer seats, an adjustable <b>headrest,</b> and an 11.1-inch touch screen inflight entertainment system {{which is also}} controllable with a video touch-screen handset as well as brand new KrisWorld software. The new seats were originally announced to only be available exclusively onboard factory-fresh Airbus A350-900 and refitted Boeing 777-300ER, but following customer feedback, Singapore Airlines announced it would refit all older 777-300ER aircraft with new cabin products as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} {{featured a}} removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable rear glass window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional <b>headrest</b> mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E
25|$|Chairs can be {{made from}} wood, metal, or other strong materials, like stone or acrylic. In some cases, {{multiple}} materials are used to construct a chair; for example, the legs and frame may be made from metal and the seat and back may be made from plastic. Chairs may have hard surfaces of wood, metal, plastic, or other materials, or some or all of these hard surfaces may be covered with upholstery or padding. The design may be made of porous materials, or be drilled with holes for decoration; a low back or gaps can provide ventilation. The back may extend above the height of the occupant's head, which can optionally contain a <b>headrest.</b> Chairs can also be made from more creative materials, such as recycled materials like cutlery and wooden play bricks, pencils, plumbing tubes, rope, corrugated cardboard, and PVC pipe.|$|E
50|$|The TX4 {{features}} a new front radiator grille, an updated interior design, updated {{front and rear}} bumpers, and a different rear vehicle registration number plate surround compared to the TXII. There are now internal <b>headrests</b> {{as a result of}} EU safety regulations.
