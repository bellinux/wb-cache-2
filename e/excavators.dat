5|$|Improbably, the <b>excavators</b> {{found the}} {{remains in the}} first {{location}} in which they dug at the car park. Coincidentally, they lay almost directly under a roughly painted 'R' on the tarmac. This had existed since the early 2000s to signify a reserved parking space.|$|E
30|$|The {{miniature}} <b>excavator</b> {{has different}} dynamic characteristics and control performance than a real <b>excavator.</b> Thus, the authors obtained a log {{for a real}} <b>excavator</b> when professional operators controlled a hoist swing during actual working conditions. Ideally, {{it is better to}} configure a controller that reproduces the transfer function of a real <b>excavator.</b> However, the transfer function changes depending on the load and engine throttle situation. Therefore, the authors reproduced the delay time and acceleration of a real machine relative to the lever input for the miniature <b>excavator</b> and approximated a real <b>excavator.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A walking <b>excavator</b> or popularly spider <b>excavator</b> is {{a special}} type of {{all-terrain}} <b>excavator.</b> Like the regular <b>excavator</b> it consists of a boom, stick, bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the [...] "house". However, the house sits atop {{a different type of}} undercarriage. The undercarriage consists of leg or arm-like extensions with or without wheels. All can move in increments hence the name walking <b>excavator.</b> This is different from an early 20th century dragline <b>excavator</b> where a set of feet plate are alternately lifted and lowered.|$|R

5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male <b>excavators,</b> who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female <b>excavators</b> (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E

5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control {{this sort of}} problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be leveled, or trimmed, using <b>excavators</b> in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} cargo's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>excavators</b> {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's {{vertebrae}} and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in its back.

5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, {{to bring it up}} {{to the level of the}} projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by <b>excavators.</b> A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E

5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by <b>excavators</b> have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam <b>excavators</b> were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E

5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the <b>excavators</b> found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable.

5|$|The first {{excavations}} at Volubilis {{were carried}} out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the <b>excavators</b> by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{academic}} publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology {{for a more}} general audience, {{both of which were}} published by Channel 4 Books as a spin-off from the Time Team television series. The first of these was Time Team's Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology, co-written with Carenza Lewis and Phil Harding and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the Palaeolithic through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record. This was followed in 2002 by Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner's Guide, which Aston co-wrote with Tony Robinson and dedicated to Harding. Archaeology is Rubbish describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the <b>excavators,</b> and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.|$|E
5|$|<b>Excavators</b> {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west.

The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by <b>excavators.</b> Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E
