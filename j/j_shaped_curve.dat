40|$|Theories {{about the}} {{potential}} health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption have been evolving in modern medicine for almost a century now, since Pearl's work {{on the relationship between}} alcohol intake and reduced mortality. Although this work was largely ignored by the medical profession at the time, the principal findings are now widely accepted among the profession and the general public alike; up to a hundred epidemiological studies conducted {{over the past three decades}} have demonstrated that moderate drinkers seem to be healthier and seem to have lower mortality rates than non-drinkers and heavy drinkers, the so-called U or <b>J</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve.</b> The resulting assumption has been that the pharmacological properties of alcohol, when consumed in moderation, have significant health benefits, especially with respect to cardiovascular disease. As a result, some expert groups have advised, albeit with caution, moderate alcohol consumption for middle aged and older men and post-menopausal women, i. e. those individuals at highest risk of cardiovascular diseas...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that the global population in 2020 will reach 8 billion compared to 6. 6 billion today. The major share of this projected increase in population will come from developing countries in Asia, Africa and also from South America. Human population growth over time from 5 million BC to 2008 AD is represented by a <b>J</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve.</b> The rapid advances in engineering and the benefits to humanity over the ages, and especially {{since the start of}} the Industrial Era are also represented by a J-shaped curve. An observation based on the “J ” shaped curve is that most of the population increase in recent years is correlated to advancement in science and engineering. From agricultural revolution to metal working to irrigation ploughing to industrialization, advances in engineering have kept pace with human population growth. To meet the demands of human population growth, advancement in engineering is vital. For example, though food production has kept pace with population growth, the so called green revolution relies heavily on petroleum-based fertilizers. Increased demand for oil has caused food prices to rise sharply on a global scale in the early part of the 21 st century. Hence, it drives policies for alternative energy sources to meet population demand. It is well known that severa...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} long term occupational exposure to lead on function of the peripheral nervous system as reflected by vibration perception threshold (VPT), measured with a portable vibrameter.  METHODS— 217 Workers in a lead battery factory were required to have an annual blood lead measurement during each of the 5  years preceding this study. All were invited to take the VPT test. A total of 206  workers were studied. The associations were analysed between VPTs and current blood lead concentration, mean concentration of blood lead over the past 5  years, maximum blood lead concentration during the past 5  years, index of cumulative blood lead (ICL), time weighted index of cumulative blood lead (TWICL), and percentage of lifespan spent {{at work in the}} plant, {{as well as the other}} potential confounders. Ordinary multiple regressions, generalised additive models, and hockey stick regression analyses were used to explore the potential existence of a threshold effect of blood lead variables on VPT.  RESULTS—VPT at a frequency of 220  Hz ranged from 6  to 100  (10 - 2 g, or 0. 098  m/s 2) with a mean (SD) of 19. 8  (14. 2) for the feet and from 4  to 43  with a mean (SD) of 10. 2  (6. 1) for the hands. The five variables of exposure to lead were all significantly correlated with VPT of the feet but not the hands. In multiple linear regression analyses, the mean of the blood lead concentrations and the TWICL were significantly associated with VPT of the feet. The relation between VPT of the feet and mean blood lead was shown to be a <b>J</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>curve</b> with a generalised additive model and local smoothing technique. In the hockey stick regression, evidence was found of a threshold effect at a mean blood lead concentration of 31  µg/dl. Above this threshold it was estimated that each increase of 1  µg/dl mean blood lead over 5  years would increase VPT of the feet by 0. 29  (10 - 2 g) or 0. 028  m/s 2 (at a frequency of 220  Hz) with other potential confounders held constant.  CONCLUSION—This study suggests that measurement of vibration sensory threshold is a relatively effective tool for detecting lead neuropathy in field studies, and that lead might cause sensory neuropathy with an effect threshold corresponding to a 5  year mean blood lead concentration of 31  µg/dl.    Keywords: blood lead; neuropathy; vibration perception threshol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{long term}} {{ecological}} research {{was carried out}} in a Hungarian oak forest, in “Bükk ” National Park starting with 1972. During the faunistical studies 3, 602 insect species and more than 200, 000 individuals were collected. The dominant orders were Coleoptera (1, 051 species), Lepidoptera (803 species), Hymenoptera (470 species) and Diptera (400 species). The relative species abundance (RSA) for all insects collected in all years of sampling period suggests a rather <b>J</b> <b>shape</b> <b>curve</b> than a not clear scaling property. This means {{that we were able to}} identify almost three quarters of the insect species from one ha European oak forest during the survey (from 1987 to 2003), and two third of the staphylinides expected. Considering the staphylinid fauna a total number of 160 species and 4, 022 individuals were collected. The most widely occurring species in dominance order were: Ocypus biharicus, Pseudocypus mus, Atheta gagatina, Philonthus quisquiliarius, Oxypoda acuminate, Platydracus chalcocephalus, Atheta crassicornis, Latrimaeum atrocephalum, Haploglossa puncticollis, Philonthus succicola and Anotylus mutator. The pooled value of alpha diversity was 1. 51. The Shannon-Weiner Index (H`) was relatively high (3. 29) in comparison with other studies...|$|R
40|$|Elephant {{impact on}} trees is of {{conservation}} concern in African savannas, but it???s effect on population size structure of heavily utilised species has received little attention. Although {{studies have shown}} that the population structure and density of Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula), a heavily utilised savanna tree species, varies widely across its range, the causes of this variation are poorly understood. This study aimed to describe and compare these divergent structures and develop an understanding of the relationship between population structure and site characteristics, specifically disturbance. Four distinct groups of population structure were identified: (1) adult dominated populations consisting of only adults and no juveniles or seedlings. The size class distributions (SCDs) of this group were bell-shaped, indicating an unstable population which may have come about through circumstances that no longer occur in these areas, for example human settlement or a massive episodic recruitment event. High impala utilisation of seedlings or rodent seed predation are proposed to be the main cause of the lack of recruitment; (2) rotated sigmoid (or negative <b>J</b> <b>shaped)</b> <b>curves,</b> representing stable population structures, when protected from elephants, as well as at high rainfall sites with elephants, indicating that without elephants and in suitable habitats with elephants, marulas are able to attain a relatively stable size structure and instability is not inherent; (3) juvenile dominated populations with almost no adults. Adults are relegated to a few refugia, where elephants are unable to reach them; (4) juvenile dominated populations consisting of mostly juveniles and few adults. These populations, all exposed to fire and elephants, have ???missing size classes??? varying between 5 and 40 cm in stem diameter and 2 ??? 8 m in height. This unstable structure was most likely caused by fire suppression of juveniles combined with elephant utilisation of individuals in the ???missing size classes???. Consistent application of this pressure is postulated to result in the progression from stable to ???missing size class??? structure, to juvenile or adult dominated populations, and finally to local extirpation, with increasing elephant densities and concomitant utilisation, interacting with fire, rainfall and soil typ...|$|R

This {{research}} related to vegetation dynamics, species composition, and ecosystem processes in tropical second-growth forest of Bosques project took place at La Selva Biological Station, Sarapiqui, Heredia {{in the northern part}} of Costa Rica. The objective was the analysis of the dynamics and structure of two tropical secondary rainforest of different age. I analyzed the vertical and horizontal structure of two forests. In addition, I evaluated the crown cover, the phenology, and the diametrical increase and overall height of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh. My results indicated that both forests presented a typical horizontal distribution, with an inverse <b>J</b> – <b>shaped</b> <b>curve.</b> In addition, my results showed that the maximum number of individuals were in the middle layers of height. The average area of crowns increased in proportion with the increase in the categories of height, as well as with average size of the crowns. Greater phenological activity (flowering and fruition) occurred in the middle height categories and in the diametrical low categories. Both sites showed good increases in diameter in comparison with other sites in northern Costa Rica, where the majority of increases were registered in the average diametrical categories. The increases in height were primarily seen in the trees in approval advanced categories of height. My principal conclusion was that these forest presented the same dynamics and structure of secondary forest that have been studied in other parts of the humid tropics, that influenced in the horizontal and vertical composition of these forest. I recommend that future research include similar studies in other forest that can be used to improve the management of these forests. Instituto Tecnológico de Cota Rica.
