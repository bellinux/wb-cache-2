5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E

When further explosions within the catacombs scupper chances of deeper investigation, the surviving members of the team are left with nothing to do but await the arrival of a Xeno rescue shuttle.|$|E

25|$|Dolci died on December 30, 1997 in Trappeto, {{from heart}} failure.

25|$|In New England, {{predator}} depletion <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> extensive marsh die-off {{salt marsh}} creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks {{in more than}} 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The nocturnal purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, is playing {{a major role in}} this die-off through increased burrowing and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by human disturbances as the primary agent driving die-off.|$|E

As a result, the steadily increasing passenger traffic <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> a massive modernization of the entire airport infrastructure. A newly built Terminal 1 of the Pulkovo airport was put into operation on December 4, 2013 and integrated international flights of the former terminal Pulkovo-2. The renovated terminal Pulkovo-1 has been opened for domestic flights {{as an extension of}} the Terminal 1 in 2015.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{range of}} studies, {{including}} a 2001 study by the Centre for Women’s Health Studies and Promotion at Ben Gurion University, in the transition from self-subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry to a settled semi-urban lifestyle, women have lost their traditional sources of power within the family. The study explains that poor access to education among women <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> new disparities between Bedouin men and women and compounded the loss of Bedouin women's status in the family. Nevertheless, due to high levels of poverty among the Bedouin more and more Bedouin women are starting to work outside their homes and reinforce their status.|$|E
25|$|Some vegans {{will not}} buy woollen jumpers, silk scarves, leather shoes, bedding that {{contains}} goose down or duck feathers, pearl jewellery, seashells, ordinary soap (usually made of animal fat), or cosmetics that contain animal products. They avoid certain vaccines; the flu vaccine, for example, is usually grown in hens' eggs, although an effective alternative, Flublok, is {{widely available in}} the United States. Non-vegan items acquired before they became vegan might be donated to charity or used until worn out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.|$|E

25|$|The mediaeval {{church had}} three altars, with an apse {{in the south}} instead of the normal eastern orientation. This unusual feature <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> many discussions among experts, and it is {{suspected}} that the church was adapted from a previously secular building. The church was surrounded by shops and a nearby building housed the Stadtguardia, a forerunner of the modern police. The old church burned down in 1661 and was given only makeshift repairs. The decision {{to build a new}} church was taken up {{with the arrival of the}} Fraternity of the Holy Trinity of which the emperor Leopold I was a member. He had taken a vow to rebuild this church when Vienna was ravaged by the plague in 1679-1680.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{effects from}} anatoxin-a {{progress}} very rapidly because it acts {{directly on the}} nerve cells (neurons). The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-a exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Stimulation of these receptors causes a muscular contraction. The anatoxin-a molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, {{and in this way}} it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> a contraction, anatoxin-a does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.|$|E
25|$|With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever {{he showed}} that {{traversable}} Lorentzian wormholes can {{exist in the}} structure of spacetime only if they are threaded by quantum fields in quantum states that violate the averaged null energy condition (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region). This <b>has</b> <b>triggered</b> research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended negative energy. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender paradoxes – there are no initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that any situation in a time travel story turns out to permit many consistent solutions.|$|E
