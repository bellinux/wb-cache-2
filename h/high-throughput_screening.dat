5|$|In chemistry, {{peptides}} are synthesized by {{a variety}} of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening</b> methods based on microarrays. However, the utility of these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E

5|$|New {{drugs are}} the {{products}} of a long drug development process, {{the first step of}} which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor. In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error: screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge. This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening</b> technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|Counting {{cells and}} colonies is an {{integral}} part of <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screens</b> and quantitative cellular assays. Due to its subjective and time-intensive nature, manual counting has hindered the adoption of cellular assays such as tumor spheroid formation in <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screens.</b> The objective of this study was to develop an automated method for quick and reliable counting of cells and colonies from digital images. For this purpose, I developed an ImageJ macro Cell Colony Edge and a CellProfiler Pipeline Cell Colony Counting, and compared them to other open-source digital methods and manual counts. The ImageJ macro Cell Colony Edge is valuable in counting cells and colonies, and measuring their area, volume, morphology, and intensity. In this study, I demonstrate that Cell Colony Edge is superior to other open-source methods, in speed, accuracy and applicability to diverse cellular assays.

25|$|Combined, 'semi-rational' {{approaches}} are being investigated {{to address the}} limitations of both rational design and directed evolution. Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focussed libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focussed library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library and so does not require such <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in pandemic proportions {{throughout the world}} and the paucity of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis have re-iterated the need to accelerate the discovery of novel molecules with anti-tubercular activity. Though <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screens</b> for anti-tubercular activity are available, they are expensive, tedious and time-consuming to be performed on large scales. Thus, there remains an unmet need to prioritize the molecules that are taken up for biological screens to save on cost and time. Computational methods including Machine Learning have been widely employed to build classifiers for <b>high-throughput</b> virtual <b>screens</b> to prioritize molecules for further analysis. The availability of datasets based on <b>high-throughput</b> biological <b>screens</b> or assays in public domain makes computational methods a plausible proposition for building predictive models. In addition, this approach would save significantly on the cost, effort and time required to run high throughput screens. Results We show that by using four supervised state-of-the-art classifiers (SMO, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and J 48) we are able to generate in-silico predictive models on an extremely imbalanced (minority class ratio: 0. 6 %) large dataset of anti-tubercular molecules with reasonable AROC (0. 6 - 0. 75) and BCR (60 - 66 %) values. Moreover, these models are able to provide 3 - 4 fold enrichment over random selection. Conclusions In the present study, we have used the data from in-vitro screens for anti-tubercular activity from a <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screen</b> available in public domain to build highly accurate classifiers based on molecular descriptors of the molecules. We show that Machine Learning tools can be used to build highly effective predictive models for virtual <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screens</b> to prioritize molecules from large molecular libraries. </p...|$|R

25|$|Although β-hematin can be {{produced}} in assays spontaneously at low pH, {{the development of a}} simple and reliable method to measure the production of hemozoin has been difficult. This is in part due to the continued uncertainty over what molecules are involved in producing hemozoin, and partly from the difficulty in measuring the difference between aggregated or precipitated heme, and genuine hemozoin. Current assays are sensitive and accurate, but require multiple washing steps so are slow and not ideal for <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening.</b> However, some screens have been performed with these assays.|$|E

2500|$|A {{recently}} described {{method by}} Ehrich et al. further {{takes advantage of}} bisulfite-conversions by adding a base-specific cleavage step to enhance the information gained from the nucleotide changes. [...] By first using in vitro transcription of the region of interest into RNA (by adding an RNA polymerase promoter site to the PCR primer in the initial amplification), RNase A {{can be used to}} cleave the RNA transcript at base-specific sites. [...] As RNase A cleaves RNA specifically at cytosine and uracil ribonucleotides, base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant dTTP when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired. [...] The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by MALDI-TOF. [...] Bisulfite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand. [...] C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated CpG sites. [...] By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of CpG sites within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole. [...] This method demonstrated efficacy for <b>high-throughput</b> <b>screening,</b> allowing for interrogation of numerous CpG sites in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner.|$|E
