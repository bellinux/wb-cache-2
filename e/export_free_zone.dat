40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Export {{processing}} zones (EPZs) are {{policy instruments}} that {{are aimed at}} achieving the goal of economic development through boosting the manufacturing industry {{in a bid to}} increase and promote export. This is achieved by setting up or designating various areas or warehouses as <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> in which an environment that is friendly to manufacturing for exports, is established. Incentives such as tax exemptions for the import of required raw materials are given in these zones. EPZs are also known by other names but the most commonly used are <b>free</b> trade <b>zones,</b> industrial <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> maquiladoras, <b>export</b> <b>free</b> <b>zones,</b> duty-free <b>export</b> processing <b>zones,</b> <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and privileged zones, to mention a few. Similar to many other developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Zambia has a bias towards export orientation as a tool of economic development. This culminated in the formulation of EPZ legislation in 2001. The EPZ act was similar to EPZ legislation in various other countries and provided for the development of an industrial park in which manufacturing for export purposes would take place for both the public and the private sector. After awarding a few companies EPZ status, the government abandoned the act and embarked on more research, resulting {{in the development of the}} multi-facility economic zone (MFEZ) in 2007. Recognition of the role of non-traditional exports (NTEs) in increasing export earnings has been important in the justification for EPZ’s development in the country. There has been a drive to attract investment into this sector by means of export-promoting policies. However, and notwithstanding the fact that numerous cost benefit studies have been undertaken to determine actual benefits of zone erection, Zambia has not yet undertaken a comprehensive synopsis of the country’s specific policies which would need to be established in order for the zone to be successful...|$|R

40|$|This article {{comments}} on the industrial structure of developing countries’ <b>export</b> processing <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> (EPZ). As developing countries are exposed to irrecoverable entry costs in international markets, the relationship between export supply and exchange rates {{has been shown to}} be persistent. In addition to hampering entry, the market entry costs thus complicate export supply responses. As the form of persistence varies between industry structures, market entry costs might also affect EPZ optimal industry structure. In order to create successful export promotion programs through EPZ, these differences should be taken into account.

40|$|Practice in {{developed}} and developing countries indicates the existence of numerous and heterogeneous <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> {{as well as the}} different role which they have in the economic development of countries that have implemented them. The main objective for start-up of a modern <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> with industrial characteristics is to attract those investors who will build the industrial infrastructure for the production of goods aimed for <b>exports.</b> Consequently, <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> will contribute, inter alia, to the increase in national exports and decrease in deficit of the country’s current account, to the creation of new jobs and new added value, to the increase in the dynamics of economic activities and generation of new entrepreneurial opportunities, to the transfer of new technologies, knowledge, skills, good organizational and managerial business practice, {{as well as to the}} reduction of regional imbalance. Experiences of former transition countries indicate that a <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> represents an important policy instrument for the attraction of foreign direct investment, especially the greenfield ones. Furthermore, experiences of developed countries indicate that <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> can act as a policy instrument for promoting regional development and development of a country as a whole.

40|$|Many {{countries}} with <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> or <b>export</b> processing zones now exempt from corporate income taxation {{the income of}} firms exporting from these areas. The WTO has attempted to eliminate this exemption through its rules to promote the non-discrimination of fiscal systems with respect to export production. In particular, these rules do not allow countries to exempt the income of firms <b>exporting</b> from <b>Free</b> Trade <b>Zones</b> from corporate income taxation. This paper examines both theoretically as well as empirically the incidence of removing this corporate income tax exemption. The empirical analysis is carried out for {{the case of the}} Dominican Republic. The findings indicate {{that in the case of}} the Dominican Republic the removal of the corporate income tax exemption would inflict a burden on labour equal to about 6 times the amount of additional corporate tax revenue collected from the companies operating in its <b>free</b> trade <b>zones.</b> WTO, tax incidence, <b>Free</b> Trade <b>Zones,</b> corporate taxation...|$|R

The economy is increasingly diversified, with significant private-sector activity in sugar, tourism, economic processing zones, and financial services, particularly in offshore enterprises. The government is trying to modernize the sugar and textile industries, which in the past were overly dependent on trade preferences, while promoting diversification into such areas as information and communications technology, financial and business services, seafood processing and <b>exports,</b> and <b>free</b> trade <b>zones.</b> Agriculture and industry have become less important to the economy, and services, especially tourism, accounted for over 72 percent of GDP.

30|$|Understanding {{what the}} term free port covers {{is the first}} step to {{approach}} the structure of free ports. The Atlas of the <b>Free</b> <b>Zones</b> in the World (Bost, 2010), compiled more than forty-five different names that have been used related to the concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> According to the author, these terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes they are simply marketing terms from the promoters of a zone. Therefore, there is confusion about both definitions and concepts. From this taxonomy, it is considered that <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> is a concept that can be divided into two categories: export processing zones that are manufacturing-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and <b>free</b> trade <b>zones</b> that are trade-oriented <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> The World Bank (2008; Farole, 2011) has the same dual approach by using the term special economic zone while referring to a <b>free</b> <b>zone.</b> This term makes sense if the status of such zones is considered although it creates confusion because there is a specific Chinese model of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> named Special Economic Zones and this model covers only a part of the concept. Free port, however, is the long-standing terminology of such zones and refers to the logistic function of the concept (Lavissière et al., 2014). It is argued that the term free port is a transversal concept of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> and a <b>free</b> port can either be an export processing <b>zone</b> or a <b>free</b> trade <b>zone.</b> It is therefore the term that has been retained.|$|R

30|$|Today, few free ports {{remain at}} the level of a city state, but there are notable {{exceptions}} such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and Dubai. Still, they belong to larger economic entities having a common customs regulatory regime. Nowadays, there are free ports connecting to a network of <b>free</b> <b>zones.</b> These <b>free</b> ports are incorporating different types of <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> such as industry and services into a ‘free zone area’. Mauritius, for instance, linked the <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> of its port and airport to industrial zones producing textile and then developed an IT dedicated <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> (Lavissière, 2014). All these zones are linked commercially but also physically within customs corridors (where flows are permitted on the domestic system as long as they go from one element of the <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> to another). Tanger-Med has a similar development strategy with its port, a planned airport, an automotive <b>free</b> <b>zone,</b> a logistics <b>free</b> port, an industrial <b>free</b> <b>zone</b> and an offshore banking <b>free</b> <b>zone.</b> This model illustrates a regionalization of free ports by permitting a specialization of the free port functions within the free port itself as well as through satellite facilities. Thus, the regulatory framework of free ports corresponds to infrastructural developments of transport terminals in regard to their hinterland. Tanger-Med and Barcelona <b>Free</b> <b>Zone</b> also signed an agreement on promotion, exchange of best practices and trade facilitation that creates a customs free corridor between the two entities. In the United States, <b>free</b> <b>zones</b> are technically networked since it is possible to move goods from one zone to another without disbursing custom duties.
