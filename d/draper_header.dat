40|$|Soybeans must be {{harvested}} during {{a limited time}} period using expensive combines and associated equipment. Maximizing combine field efficiency, {{the ratio of the}} actual harvesting capacity to theoretical harvesting capacity, is an important objective of machinery managers. Spatial and temporal yield data from a 2012 CaseIH 8120 Axial-Flow combine equipped with a 9 meter MacDon D- 65 <b>Draper</b> <b>header</b> and the Case-IH Advanced Farming System (AFS) yield monitoring system were used to examine field efficiency when harvesting soybean in three Arkansas Delta irrigated soybean fields during the 2015 season. Time efficiencies (TE) in the three fields ranged from 72. 9...|$|E
5000|$|Some wheat headers, called [...] "draper" [...] headers, use {{a fabric}} or rubber apron {{instead of a}} cross auger. <b>Draper</b> <b>headers</b> allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher {{throughputs}} due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs.|$|R
