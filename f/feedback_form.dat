40|$|This {{research}} {{essay is}} a critical review and synthesis of extensive research on e-democracy (electronic democracy) {{as a means to}} strengthen the democratic relationship between citizens, their government and elected officials. E-democracy is founded on citizen participation in order to support legitimate representation in a democratic society. It is based on providing an online opportunity for citizens to obtain information about issues and express their position. The use of online <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> as a potential information and communication technologies (ICT) structure for e-democracy will be discussed. The advanced <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> highlighted in this research essay provide a means to use ICT to strengthen democracy by using presumptive arguments and practical reasoning. Advanced online <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> will be shown to strengthen democracy. The research findings are important in an era of general political disengagement by citizens. Online participation, through such means as advanced <b>feedback</b> <b>forms,</b> can facilitate citizen engagement to realize a strong democracy...|$|R

5000|$|During the 1940s, [...] "fly-by-night" [...] for-profit colleges {{sprang up}} to collect veterans' {{education}} grants, because the program provided limited oversight.

The Veterans Administration, however, does have a GI Bill <b>feedback</b> <b>form</b> for recipients to address their complaints against colleges. President Barack Obama also signed Executive Order 13607 which was to ensure that predatory colleges did not aggressively recruit vulnerable military service members, veterans, and their families.|$|E
5000|$|The {{infinite}} horizon problem (i.e., LQR) {{may seem}} overly restrictive and essentially useless because {{it assumes that}} the operator is driving the system to zero-state and hence driving {{the output of the}} system to zero. This is indeed correct. However the problem of driving the output to a desired nonzero level can be solved after the zero output one is. In fact, it can be proved that this secondary LQR problem can be solved in a very straightforward manner.

50|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>forms</b> on website {{are prone}} to spam submissions. There are cases when {{employees}} themselves submit feedback - positive for their professional gain, and negative if targeting colleagues. Some service centers make employees sign blank <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> to create positive statistics. Such situations can be prevented by seeking verification of identity of customers. This is especially possible on online setups, such as ActPlease.com, which uses SMS to verify {{the authenticity of the}} mobile number of reporter. Basic tools such as Captcha can prevent automatic spammers. Mass submission of false feedback becomes less likely and easy to detect in case of paper-based submission.|$|R

50|$|The {{scale models}} {{entered in the}} contest are judged {{according}} to the AMPS Contest Rules, and may be awarded Gold, Silver or Bronze medals. Scale models are judged for accuracy, level of detail, skill in construction, and paint/markings finish. Some of these models take hundreds of hours to complete. Each modeler is provided with a <b>feedback</b> <b>form</b> showing the points given in each area and what areas need to improve. An 'open' system of judging is used in which each model competes against a standard, not against other entries. Thus, instead of 1st, 2nd and 3rd-place medals, awards are given to all models that reach specified cutoff scores. Since participants are not competing against one another, there is no disincentive to the sharing of techniques and ideas.|$|E

50|$|The next morning, {{the guests}} will each usually offer {{feedback}} {{on how they}} slept, and the host/s will prepare breakfast for the others. Once breakfast has been served and consumed, the guests will fill out an anonymous <b>feedback</b> <b>form</b> where they can summarize all of their criticisms, both positive and negative, into one, by both scoring a series of relevant categories out of ten and writing any comments they wish about their stay, including if {{they would like to}} stay again. They will then place in an envelope how much money they think their stay was worth in relation to the asking price of their room. In order to resolve any differences in price between the different rooms and B&B's, the host's final score is presented as a percentage. For example, if one set of owners paid £60 for a room that normally sells for £80, thereby only paying 75%, and the other set paid £110 for a stay that normally commands £100, thereby paying 110%, the host's final score would be 94%. This money is sealed and the host alongside the other owners cannot see its contents until all of the owners have had their B&B's visited and critiqued. However, the owner/s can look at the anonymous feedback forms and this may influence what they say or do in the coming visits to B&B's of the other B&B owners.|$|E
40|$|Student Feedback {{has become}} {{increasingly}} important as libraries tailor their services to the customer. A team from Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University Libraries analyzed student <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> to determine impressions from library information literacy classes. This paper analyzes student <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> through both traditional assessment and a coded-analysis using ATLAS. ti.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} public participation on decision-making, with a specific focus on the City of Toronto’s 2011 Core Service Review. It uses both qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the case. Quantitative data is collected through the <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> the City used for public consultation during the Core Service Review, while qualitative data is collected from both the <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> and the roundtable discussions held across Toronto in 2011. The findings reveal that, from a process perspective, government efforts were directed at enlarging participation through a well-designed mechanism and project promotion, while the impact analysis found that public input indicated a strong willingness to pay more {{in order to maintain}} or increase a service...|$|R
50|$|Feedback {{analytics}} services use customer generated feedback data {{to measure}} customer experience and improve customer satisfaction. Feedback data is collected, then, using {{key performance indicators}} and feedback metrics, turned into actionable information for website improvement. Feedback analytics services provide website owners {{with the ability to}} create feedback forms that can be customized to fit the website and placed on all pages. This allows the website's users to submit feedback when they encounter a problem or have a feature request. A feedback button is visible at all times on each of the site's pages. Feedback analytics provide page- and website- level actionable data, and enable a website owner to read and manage feedback, as well as {{to get back to the}} users. The feedback is only made accessible to the website owner. This means that websites using feedback analytics are not exposed to the potential harm to their brand that feedback made public may cause. Feedback collection can be passive (using a feedback button), or active (using a <b>feedback</b> <b>form</b> set to appear in certain conditions), or both. The ability to choose the location of the button, as well as the frequency and conditions of the pop-up make feedback analytics a relatively non-intrusive approach from the point of view of the website user. Due to its measurable nature, feedback analytics data can be integrated with web analytics data, allowing website owners to understand what their users are doing on their site (using web analytics) and why they do it (using feedback analytics), in one single interface.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the early development approval {{stages of a}} proposed new integrated mega-resort in regional Queensland {{within the framework of}} evaluating public interest. In addition to conducting a number of industry and community based focus groups and face-to-face meetings, 1979 <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> were collected by the project's community engagement team through an information shopfront on behalf of a major project proponent. Analysis of the <b>feedback</b> <b>forms</b> indicates that 91 % of respondents support the project going ahead, however biases in age/sex distribution exist in the sample. Concerns regarding a number of aspects of the proposed development are also raised, however these are significantly outnumbered by the positive comments, raising questions on how to effectively evaluate the public interest within a neoliberal government paradigm...|$|R
