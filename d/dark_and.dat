5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale and large-toothed, crinitus is large, <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> large-toothed, regillus is large and <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> albiventer is large and relatively pale.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings pale mouse colour, dusted with <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> with traces of a <b>dark</b> central <b>and</b> double submarginal fascia, marked with <b>dark</b> brown <b>and</b> ferruginous. The hindwings are without markings.|$|R

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> light {{bands in}} the fully formed feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used}} to determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat is <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are {{considered}} a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, {{as it can be}} infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis.|$|E

5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than <b>Dark</b> <b>and</b> Very dark, which are both <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> have an intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the}} season tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

50|$|This {{class of}} {{theories}} attempts {{to come up}} with an all-encompassing theory of both <b>dark</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy as a single phenomenon that modifies the laws of gravity at various scales. This could for example treat <b>dark</b> energy <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> matter as different facets of the same unknown substance, or postulate that cold dark matter decays into dark energy. Another class of theories that unifies <b>dark</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy are suggested to be covariant theories of modified gravities. These theories alter the dynamics of the space-time such that the modified dynamic stems what have been assigned to the presence of <b>dark</b> energy <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> matter.|$|R
5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them.

The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E

Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{progress}} reported at this Royal Society Discussion Meeting and advertizes some possible future directions in our drive to understand <b>dark</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy. Additionally, a first attempt {{is made to}} place in context the exciting new results from the WMAP satellite, which were published shortly after this Meeting. In {{the first part of}} this review, pieces of observational evidence shown here that bear on the amounts of <b>dark</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy are reviewed. Subsequently, particle candidates for dark matter are mentioned, and detection strategies are discussed. Finally, ideas are presented for calculating the amounts of <b>dark</b> matter <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> energy, <b>and</b> possibly relating them to laboratory data.

5|$|The only specimen, the holotype, {{is mostly}} {{brownish}} above, with <b>dark</b> <b>and</b> light spots, and white below. The snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in). Several {{features of the}} scales align it with Trachylepis over the related American genus Mabuya.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, <b>dark,</b> <b>and</b> {{appears to be}} reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.|$|E
