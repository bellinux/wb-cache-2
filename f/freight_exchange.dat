500|$|Roads in Sisimiut, {{including}} {{the road to}} the airport, are surfaced, but there is no road linking Sisimiut to any other settlement. In the 2000s construction of the [...] road to Kangerlussuaq was discussed for several years without resolution. The road would have been {{the first of its kind}} in Greenland, connecting two far-away settlements, and reducing the need for passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>exchange</b> at Kangerlussuaq Airport, the Air Greenland hub. The cost of around €40 (€700 per inhabitant of Greenland) and €1M in annual maintenance cost has prevented construction. The town has its own bus network. In winter dog sled routes are used to link to settlements further north. Snowmobiles are, as a more modern approach, also used. Transport within a town is usually done by foot, although both private cars and the city bus – which drives loops through town – are popular.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe more {{efficient}} configuration and coordination of multimodal transports {{is a topic}} consistently emerging in the last decades. Several projects, like e. g. LOGFOR, CODE 24 and CENTRAL EUROPE, make efforts to achieve progress in this area. This paper presents an already implemented and tested software prototype for the configuration of multimodal supply chains and describes how this prototype, which emerged from the CODE 24 project, is able to facilitate contact between potential business partners and it is shown how {{the implementation of the}} prototype and the research into <b>freight</b> <b>exchanges</b> led the authors of this paper to a new market place concept: AFEX – Agent-based <b>Freight</b> <b>Exchanges.</b> It is shown how these yet to be implemented, highly automated and interconnected market places will alleviate problems commonly associated with existing market places and provide support for decentralized and autonomous software agents to perform contractually binding auctions of multimodal freight transport services utilizing a double-sided combinatorial auction model. Finally, an outlook on prospective concepts which support the negotiation of contracts for multimodal transport services using multi-agent systems is given...|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a <b>freight</b> <b>exchange</b> is to fill empty {{vehicles}} on their return journeys (when they {{are on their way}} back to their depot after a delivery) by matching them to available freight. For example, a trucker has an order to transport tulips from Keukenhof in the Netherlands to Como, Italy. Ideally, a freight order for the return trip would increase profitability, so the trucker would search for return freight or return load on a <b>freight</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E

It has three lines of businesses, including International Dry Bulk, Domestic Coastal Coal, and International Container.

Based on the success and experience from container freight contracts, SSEFC launched coastal coal contracts in 2012. In 2014, {{in order to better}} achieve the risk shifting effect of shipping freight derivatives, SSEFC innovated and launched the world's first physical-deliverable shipping capacity contract.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, {{the station}} was served by a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) from Ebernburg on the Alsenz Valley Railway that stopped at the {{stations}} between Bad Münster and Lauterecken-Grumbach and then ran without stopping to Homburg. Another local freight trains was responsible for serving stations between Lauterecken-Grumbach and Homburg. If necessary, another through freight train ran from Homburg to Lauterecken-Grumbach. In Odernheim there was a siding to the local oil mill, which was served by a <b>freight</b> <b>exchange</b> train (Übergabegüterzug). After freight traffic on the Glan Valley Railway was significantly reduced after the Second World War, the sections with freight traffic were served by a <b>freight</b> <b>exchange</b> train.|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} of the above {{developments}} we gradually see the emergence of Internet-based communities of interests and electronic auction mechanisms. The virtual market places that implement <b>freight</b> <b>exchanges</b> offer carriers the perspective of an easier access to loads and smoother operations. This is certainly true for full-load carriers, but it also presents significant opportunities for consolidation-type companies, LTL motor carriers in particular. The loads that could be obtained by accessing these markets would reduce the need to move empty vehicles to balance the operations. Such markets complement the more traditional auctions of distribution routes of major industrial or retail firms [13].|$|R

Sometimes it served troop trains to the neighbouring Baumholder military training area. In 1905, it received or dispatched a total of 35,495.11 tons of freight. The station mainly received bricks, limestone, malt, flour, iron and other fertilizers, cement, gypsum and lime. It shipped mainly wire and wire nails, cereal and beer. In 1920, a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and another ran between Altenglan and Kusel. A through freight train (Durchgangsgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel. After the Second World War, revenue declined steadily.

50|$|A <b>freight</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{an online}} service for haulage companies, {{logistics}} providers, freight forwarders and transport companies. It allows haulage companies to search {{a database of}} available freight {{that needs to be}} delivered and advertise their available vehicle capacity. Logistics providers and freight forwarders can advertise their freight loads that needs delivering as well as match their freight loads to the available vehicle capacity.These systems provide a platform that allows carriers to communicate freight traffic information to fellow operators such as transporters, forwarders and logistics companies. They allow forwarders to advertise their freight either privately or publicly to a large number of freight operators that are looking for loads. They also allow freight operators to offer vehicle space. Online systems are normally subscription-based with a small charge for advertising (posting) and searching (consulting).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the road freight {{transport}} industry, using the UK as a case study. It examines {{the extent to which}} Internet <b>freight</b> <b>exchanges</b> and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) processes are affecting general haulage. Recent surveys suggest that there is scope within the road transport industry to improve efficiency in terms of fill rates and empty running. Any improvements may also help to alleviate the pressures faced in many developed countries by the haulage industry, which include driver shortages, new legislation, such as the Working Time Directive in Europe, increasing road congestion, as well as to support improvements desired for sustainability. A background summary of the UK road haulage industry and the potential impact of e-commerce are provided before the results of a survey from 49 general haulage operators in their attitude to and adoption of ICT developments are analysed and assessed. The study concludes that a split picture is emerging. While many of the smaller haulage operators remain dependent upon traditional communication and process systems, the larger logistics companies, who control the majority of vehicles and freight movements, are progressively developing new ways of working supported by ICT adoption...|$|R
