5000|$|Pop-up displays: (These are {{sometimes}} called a pull-up display or portable display) A display {{which uses a}} flexible <b>graphic</b> <b>panel</b> (fabric or other man-made material) attached to a spring-loaded roller on which the graphic winds for storage. When ready to display, the graphic is pulled up, and then secured to a support post {{at the back of}} the roller, which holds the graphic up and taut in place. These can be used individually, or in series, as warrants. Like tabletop displays, they are normally very lightweight, and can be easily transported and set up without needing much on site labor support. The components are often made from very lightweight materials, and transported in small traveling cases (often injection molded plastic). Most often curved in shape, they are also now popular as straight walls with attached fabric mural graphics.|$|R

40|$|Campaigns by zoos, aquariums, {{and other}} civil society {{organizations}} {{are an important}} tool for promoting social changes that benefit the environment. Here, we evaluate a global biodiversity education campaign's impact through a repeated-measures survey of nearly 5000 visitors to 20 zoos and aquariums located in 14 countries. By comparing visitors’ pre- and post-visit responses combined across respondents, we found significant aggregate improvements in their biodiversity understanding and their knowledge of actions to help protect biodiversity. Respondents who reported seeing the education campaign's interpretive <b>graphic</b> <b>panels</b> and informative films showed a significantly higher aggregate increase in their understanding of biodiversity and actions to protect it as compared to respondents who {{did not see the}} campaign materials. These findings reaffirm the value of education at zoos and aquariums to engage members of the public with biodiversity-related issues.

40|$|The {{sense of}} {{excitement}} and intimacy that comes from discovering a real life event as it is actually happening is intense, inspiring and memorable. Yet, there remains a great tendency for zoos and aquaria to present general biological information whose content and format is independent of the observable activities of the animals. The animals are portrayed as exhibits, living illustrations of their species- dynamic objects which inspire public interest in the biological topics being presented- rather than living individuals of inherent interest. The current, observable behaviors (breeding, territorial displays, nest building, snake shedding etc) that the exhibit animals themselves, initiate, are rarely profiled. Instead, the presentation of animal behavior is most often limited to generalized statements on <b>graphic</b> <b>panels</b> or scripted narrations of trained behaviors featured in animal shows. This "predetermined " interpretive style utilizes a field guide approach to public education. Graphics, shows, narrators, videos etc. tell visitors what animal {{they are looking at}} and provide generalized natural history facts about the species on display. The predetermined approach fails to address a critical aspect of human motivation. Unless on...|$|R

5000|$|Agnew and Zebells' Wisconsin Workers Memorial {{makes use}} of the entire Zeidler Park, {{integrating}} landscape and sculpture to create the final work. The designers kept in mind the park's character when creating the memorial. They believed that the park resembled a 19th-century village green, and thus created a gazebo that resembles a bandstand as the symbol of a democratic gathering place. The gazebo, situated {{in the middle of}} the park, is decorated with salvaged gears and tools of the modern workplace. There is a huge clock inside the edifice, referencing the time spent at work as well as the fight for the eight-hour workday. The bandstand is accessible by wheelchair ramps, which serve as a useful reminder of workers injured on the job. Paths lined with ornamental chains and bollards lead from the sidewalk up to the structure. The chains display popular labor slogans and tell the story of Milwaukee's labor history from 1800 to the present through <b>graphic</b> <b>panels</b> stating important historical facts. The memorial is designed to commemorate the workers who have faced dangers and hazards on their job, as well as the struggles to overcome these hazards, thus the emphasis on Wisconsin labor history. [...] "We want to find personal stories and worker experiences that illustrate milestones in the history of working men and women,,' said Zebell, a landscape architect, and Agnew, a public sculptor. 'Wisconsin is so important nationally for being a first in legislature such as Workers Compensation." ...|$|R

50|$|The game {{centers on}} NYPD Detective Max Payne, who {{attempts}} to avenge {{the murder of}} his family. It features a gritty neo-noir style and uses <b>graphic</b> novel <b>panels</b> (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game, as it draws inspiration from hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many allusions to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök, and several of the names used in the game are those of the Norse gods and mythos. The gameplay is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, {{and it was one of}} the first games to feature the bullet time effect popularized by The Matrix.|$|R

2500|$|The backglass is a {{vertical}} <b>graphic</b> <b>panel</b> {{mounted on the}} front of the backbox, which is the upright box at the top back of the machine. The backglass contains the name of the machine, eye-catching graphics, (usually) the score displays (lights, mechanical wheels, an LED display, or a dot-matrix display depending on the era), and sometimes a mechanical device tied to game play, for example, elevator doors that opened on an image or a woman swatting a cat with a broom such as on Williams' 1989 [...] "Bad Cats". For older games, the backglass image is screen printed in layers on the reverse side of a piece of glass; in more recent games, the image is imprinted into a translucent piece of plastic-like material called a translite which is mounted behind a piece of glass and which is easily removable. The earliest games did not have backglasses or backboxes and were little more than playfields in boxes. Games are generally built around a particular theme, such as a sport or character and the backglass art reflects this theme to attract the attention of players. Recent machines are typically tied into other enterprises such as a popular film series, toy, or brand name. The entire machine is designed to be as eye-catching as possible to attract players and their money; every possible space is filled with colorful graphics, blinking lights, and themed objects, and the backglass is usually the first artwork the players see from a distance. Since the artistic value of the backglass may be quite impressive, it is not uncommon for enthusiasts to use a deep frame around a backglass (lighted from behind) and hang it as art after the remainder of the game is discarded.|$|R
