5|$|By 1812, {{advisers}} to Alexander suggested {{the possibility of}} an <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his Grande Armée to more than 450,000 men. He ignored repeated advice against an <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.|$|E

5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union has been refuted by the {{majority}} of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E

On 25 September 1944, the corps closed headquarters at Fort McPherson and moved to Hawaii. When it arrived in Hawaii, IX Corps was put {{under the command of}} the Tenth United States Army. Under the Tenth Army, IX Corps was assigned two missions. In 1944, it was primarily concerned with formulating plans for an <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastal regions of Japanese-held China.

To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} Baltic, she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. In September, she supported the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, Leipzig was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German Baltic Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt {{to break out of the}} Baltic. Leipzig returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer. Leipzig became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E
