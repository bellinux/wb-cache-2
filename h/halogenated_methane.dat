40|$|The {{adsorption}} of two <b>halogenated</b> <b>methane</b> derivatives, namely, methylene fluoride and methylene chloride, at {{the surface}} of Ih ice is studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations under tropospheric conditions. The adsorption isotherms of the two molecules, differing only in the halogen atom type, {{are found to be}} markedly different from each other. Thus, while methylene fluoride exhibits multilayer adsorption and its adsorption isotherm belongs to class II according to the IUPAC convention, methylene chloride does not show considerable adsorption at the ice surface, as its condensation well precedes the saturation of even the first adsorbed molecular layer. Interestingly, both the surface orientation and the binding energy of the two types of adsorbed molecules are rather similar to each other; first layer molecules form one single hydrogen bond with the dangling OH groups of the ice surface. The strong differences in the adsorption behavior of methylene fluoride and methylene chloride are traced back to the different cohesions in the liquid phase and, hence, to the strongly different boiling points of the two molecules...|$|E

IMPF: 01. 08 RONO: 00 The rumen is {{a highly}} diverse ecosystem comprising different microbial groups including methanogens that consume a considerable part of the ruminant?s nutrient energy in methane production. The consequences of methanogenesis in the rumen may result in the low productivity and possibly will {{have a negative impact}} on the sustainability of the ruminant?s production.

A {{need to control}} these notorious plant pests (nematodes) arose early {{in the last century}} and Methyl Bromide (MeBr) proved to be the right remedy that can be used. In addition to nematicidal properties, Methyl Bromide has also been used as an insecticide, fungicide, acaricide, herbicide and rodenticide. However, research has shown that Methyl Bromide, a chemical that has been used and trusted by farmers and crop protectionists for so many decades; causes so 'riiany environmental problems of which the greatest is the depletion of the Stratospheric Ozone Layer. Ozone layer depletion property of Methyl Bromide has led to the banning and total phase-out of the chemical under the Montreal Protocol of the United Nations. In 2015, Methyl Bromide must be totally phased out in Zimbabwe. The phase out of the much trusted MeBr has forced the science community and ' (j-. t (agriculturalists to coin new methods of nematode control that have a reduced impact on the environment and the stratospheric ozone. One of the potential chemical substitutes that have been proposed to have the same cadillac fumigant properties as Methyl Bromide but with less toxicity and ozone layer depletion potential is Methyl Iodide, another <b>halogenated</b> <b>methane.</b> In this study, Iodomethane, as Methyl Iodide is sometimes known, was tested and evaluated as a possible substitute to Methyl Bromide in conventional tobacco seedbeds fumigation. It was evaluated against weeds and nematodes in tobacco seedbeds. Phytotoxicity of Methyl Iodide was also evaluated in tobacco seeds and seedlings. Methyl bromide was applied at its standard rate of 35 g/m 2 and the Iodomethane was applied at 3 different rates of 10 g/m 2, 20 g/m 2 and 30 g/m 2. Methyl Iodide is a liquid at ambient temperature and therefore, it was applied using the hot gas system and all chemicals were applied under a 125 gauge polyvinylchloride plastic sheet. The plastics were removed 4 days after chemical application. Tobacco seeds of two Zimbabwean cultivars (T 66 and KM 10) were sown 7 days and 14 days after chemical applications. The seedbeds were mulched and watered every day, for nearly 3 months, using a hose pipe with a fine rose as recommended by the tobacco growing manual. Phytotoxicity tests, germination counts, weeds counts, seedling survival counts, gall ratings and tobacco stalk heights were some of the measured parameters. The results at 28 days after sowing indicated that Methyl Iodide effectively controlled narrow leaved weeds and broad leaved weeds (p< 0. 05) as all the three x Methyl Iodide treatments were comparable to the standard Methyl Bromide when applied 7 and 14 days before sowing (p< 0. 001). Statistically, no significant interaction was found between cultivars (T 66 and KM 10) and nematicide applied (Methyl Iodide and Methyl Bromide) (p< 0. 05). Root-knot galling assessments from bioassays which contained the soil samples taken from the treated plots at final pulling indicated that there was significant interaction between the tobacco cultivars and nematicide treatments (p< 0. 05). The test product (Mel) managed to reduce root-knot nematode numbers better than the untreated control and it was comparable to Methyl Bromide at all the three tested rates (p< 0. 001); LSD = 0. 34). Summarily, the results above show that Methyl Iodide is as effective as Methyl Bromide in controlling weeds and nematodes, even at its lowest tested rate of 1 Og/m...|$|E

The by-products of disinfection, including chloramine, halogenated humic acids, halogenated ethanes, <b>halogenated</b> acetonitriles, <b>halogenated</b> <b>methanes,</b> <b>halogenated</b> ethylenes, and N-Cl-piperidine, did not initiate GGT foci, which would indicate that they are not capable of initiating carcinogenesis. Chloroform and halogenated benzenes were tested in this assay for their ability to promote the occurrence of GGT foci and tumors initiated by diethylnitrosamine (DENA). Chloroform (1800 ppm in the drinking water) either had no effect or inhibited the occurrence of GGT foci when administered subsequent to a single dose of DENA. However, when the chloroform was administered in drinking water concurrently with weekly doses of DENA, it enhanced the formation of liver tumors. Of 20 halogenated benzenes tested, only 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene promoted the occurrence of DENA-initiated GGT foci. Thus in rat liver, the tested by-products of drinking water disinfection did not demonstrate tumor-initiating activity, although a few appeared to possess tumor-promoting activity. Chloroform was also tested for tumor-promoting activity in 15 -day-old Swiss mice initiated with ethylnitrosourea (ENU).

Nevertheless, in situ bioremediation strategies for groundwater with high concentrations of <b>halogenated</b> <b>methanes</b> such as carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF), and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC- 11) are still lacking. Among these compounds, CF is often the focal point for evaluating the feasibility of bioremediation because of its high toxicity to most microbes. For instance, inhibition of chlororespiration of chloroethenes by CF is a concern for sites co-contaminated with CF, and can only be overcome by removing the CF first (Bagley et al. [2000]). CF and CT rank highly on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry based on their frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure at National Priority List sites (ATSDR [2013]). Although not ranked by ATSDR, CFC- 11 is often a co-contaminant with CT and CF. For example, approximately 500  mg/L CF, 26  mg/L CFC- 11 and 10  mg/L CT were detected in the source zone at a former industrial site (Shan et al. [2010 b]).

In our setup, we could measure both angular and time-of-flight distributions for the fragments, and pereorm this check.

Absolute cross sections for ion-pair formation are obtained by calibrating the signal intensities with those of F^- from both SF_ 6 and CF_ 4. The cross sections for formation of X^- + CH_ 3 ^+ are much greater than for formation of CH_ 2 X^- + H^+.

These enzymes have different kinetics of methane and TCE degradation, and while all known methanotrophs produce the pMMO, only a few species of the Type II group produce the sMMO. The sMMO is only produced under conditions of copper limitation in these strains. No Type II methanotrophs have been isolated from the marine environment. Detection and identification of marine methanotrophs, as well as characterization of their rates of oxidation of methane and TCE, are important to our understanding of their response to attempts to stimulate them for in-situ bioremediation of TCE. Additionally, this information is necessary to the development of predictive models of bioremediation processes. The rate of methane oxidation by the native methanotrophic population of an estuarine sediment was measured, and the [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] values for methane of this population were determined from the Michaelis-Menten equation. The [ [...] . ] values (8 - 26 [ [...] . ]) suggest that the particulate methane monooxygenase is being used for methane oxidation. Several methanotrophs were isolated from this estuarine sediment after enriching it, and gene probes based on 16 S rRNA sequences were used to identify the genus groups of these isolates. No Type II methanotrophs were isolated. The kinetics of methane and TCE oxidation by one of the methanotrophic isolates were measured, and {{it was found that the}} amount of copper added to the growth medium affects the kinetics of methane and TCE oxidation by this strain. When copper was added, the [ [...] . ] values were 10 - 13 [ [...] . ] but when no copper was added the results varied from a slightly elevated [ [...] . ] (16 [ [...] . ]) to a high [ [...] . ] for which saturation with methane was not observed. When copper was added to cultures used for TCE degradation, [ [...] . ] values were 8 - 10 [ [...] . ], but when no copper was added, TCE degradation was not observed. The kinetics of methane and TCE oxidation in enriched estuary sediment were measured, and based on the elevated [ [...] . ] values (48 - 53 [ [...] . ]), the limited increase in the [ [...] . ] values (an indicator of a relatively small increase in the population), and the lack of TCE degradation in the enriched sediment, it is suggested that the methanotrophs may become limited for copper during enrichment. The data suggest that the sMMO is not being produced, even under copper limitation, consistent with the fact that no Type II methanotrophs were isolated. Therefore simple enrichment of marine methanotrophic populations may not result in enhanced TCE degradation rates. Nutrient addition, including bioavailable copper, will be necessary for the use of marine methanotrophs for in-situ TCE bioremediation. Gene probing was used to detect the presence of Type I methanotrophs in the sediment by probing slot blots of DNA extracted directly from the sediment. These blots were also used to estimate the number of methanotrophs present in the enriched sediment and this value was compared to estimates of methanotroph numbers based on [ [...] . ] values. These estimates were found to agree within the expected error of each estimation method, suggesting that gene probing will be a useful method for estimation of methantroph numbers in environmental samples...|$|R
