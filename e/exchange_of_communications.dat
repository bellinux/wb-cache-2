40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{architectural}} languages {{have begun to}} introduce so-called connectors. Connectors separate communication code from the application-specific components {{so that it can}} be easily exchanged. Unfortunately, however, communication code is usually deeply woven into the components and often has to be replaced when the component is reused in a different context. In this paper we show that standard connectors alone are often not sufficient, since they are too limited in their adaptation and architectural support. As a solution to this problem, we propose meta-programming grey-box-connectors. They combine the architectural support of black-box connectors and the adaptation capabilities of white-box reuse. They allow for powerful manipulations such as removal of interfaces or changing inheritance relations, combined with the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>communications.</b> Finally, since they can be applied to themselves, they can be used for global configuration of the system architecture [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop {{software}} and strategies for the exploitation of parallel computer hardware, in particular distributed memory systems, and embedding these strategies within a parallelisation tool to allow the automatic generation of these strategies. The parallelisation of four structured mesh codes using the Computer Aided Parallelisation Tools provided a good initial parallelisation of the codes. However, investigation revealed that simple optimisation <b>of</b> the <b>communications</b> within these codes provided an even better improvement in performance. The dominant factor within the communications was the data transfer time with communication start-up latencies also significant. This was significant throughout the codes but especially in sections of pipelined code where there were large amounts of communication present. This thesis describes the development and testing of the methods used to increase the performance <b>of</b> these <b>communications</b> by overlapping them with unrelated calculation. This method <b>of</b> overlapping the <b>communications</b> {{was applied to the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> data <b>communications</b> as well as the pipelined communications. The successful application by hand provided the motivation for these methods to be incorporated and automatically generated within the Computer Aided Parallelisation Tools. These methods were integrated within these tools as an additional stage of the parallelisation. This required a generic algorithm that made use of many of the symbolic algebra tests and symbolic variable manipulation routines within the tools. The automatic generation <b>of</b> overlapped <b>communications</b> was applied to the four codes previously parallelised as well as a further three codes, one of which was a real world Computational Fluid Dynamics code. The methods to apply automatic generation <b>of</b> overlapped <b>communications</b> to unstructured mesh codes were also discussed. These methods are similar to those applied to the structured mesh codes and their automation is viewed to be of a similar fashion...|$|R
40|$|To {{better serve}} society, {{infrastructure}} organizations must manage their civil infrastructure systems effectively and efficiently, employing {{best practices in}} infrastructure management and relevant information systems. As information systems mature, communications follow a general trend away from informal human-to-human communications towards computer-to-computer information exchange. For efficient implementation <b>of</b> computer-based <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> information, these <b>communications</b> must be formally described. As {{part of a larger}} study into the formalization <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> within the infrastructure industry, this paper examines the level to which work processes and communications are formalized and designed at present within the domain of infrastructure management. The research adopts a maturity model approach. There are many maturity models available in different industries, but their focus is on the maturity of the way work processes and communication are operated and managed, not the way these work processes and communications are formalized and designed. To address the issue, an Infrastructure Management-Process Maturity Model (IM-PMM) is developed to assess the degree to which work processes and communications are formalized within a specific engineering domain, namely infrastructure management. A five-step approach is used to develop the IM-PMM: define the problem, compare existing maturity models, develop the model, apply the model, and evaluate the maturity model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{compare the}} rates of {{one-shot}} and iterative conferencing in a cooperative Gaussian relay channel. The relay and receiver cooperate via a conference, as introduced by Willems, in which they <b>exchange</b> a series <b>of</b> <b>communications</b> over orthogonal links. Under one-shot conferencing, decode-and-forward (DF) is capacity-achieving when the relay has a strong channel. On the other hand, Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward (CF) approaches the cut-set bound when the conference link capacity is large. To contrast with one-shot conferencing, we consider a two-round iterative conference scheme; it comprises CF in the first round, and DF in the second. When the relay has a weak channel, the iterative scheme is disadvantageous. However, when the relay channel is strong, iterative cooperation, with optimal allocation of conferencing resources, outperforms one-shot cooperation provided that the conference link capacity is large. When precise allocation of conferencing resources is not possible, we consider iterative cooperation with symmetric conference links, and show that the iterative scheme still surpasses one-shot cooperation, albeit under more restricted conditions.
