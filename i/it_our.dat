This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience.

[...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew us away – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E

500|$|According to critic Vladimir Stasov, Glazunov and Tchaikovsky {{first met}} in October 1884 at a {{gathering}} hosted by Balakirev. Glazunov was then 19 years old. Tchaikovsky was in Saint Petersburg because his opera Eugene Onegin was being {{performed at the}} Mariinsky Theater. Glazunov later wrote that while the nationalists' circle [...] "was no longer so ideologically closed and isolated {{as it had been}} earlier", they [...] "did not consider P.I. Tchaikovsky one of our own. We valued only a few of his works, like Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca [...] and the finale of the Second Symphony. The rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us". Tchaikovsky's presence won over Glazunov and the other young members present, and his conversation with them [...] "was a fresh breeze amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere... Many of the young musicians present, including Lyadov and myself, left Balakirev's apartment charmed by Tchaikovsky's personality.... As Lyadov put <b>it,</b> <b>our</b> acquaintance with the great composer was a real occasion." ...|$|E
500|$|Some would claim... {{that it is}} {{the most}} American of our orchestras, {{thinking}} no doubt of the Previn legacy, Bernstein's Presidency and Tilson Thomas's appointment. Others, looking back further to Pierre Monteux's reign, think <b>it</b> <b>our</b> most French orchestra, a quality nurtured by Previn and latterly Claudio Abbado. But what of their essaying of the Slavonic repertoire under Istvan Kertész, or of Mahler, whose idiom has been finely honed by Abbado? No, the LSO remains enigmatic, unpredictable and supremely individual. Of all the London orchestras the LSO seems to have more [...] "personalities", more [...] "individuals" [...] and has given the solo world more than its fair share of [...] "star" [...] performers. As an orchestra the LSO has never been prepared to submit to one principal conductor for long (one thinks of Karajan in Berlin, Haitink in Amsterdam or Mravinsky in Leningrad) but one of its greatest strengths remains its ability to attract fine conductors and dedicate itself wholeheartedly to creating a genuine performance.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life– [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call <b>it</b> <b>our</b> theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E

500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity. The promotional press sheet {{that accompanied the}} album's release implied Nas’s refusal to conform to commercial trends, stating: “While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.” At {{the time of the}} album's release, the hip hop community was embroiled in a debate about artistic authenticity and commercialism in popular music. Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for so many of us. We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; we grew up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – and we felt <b>it.</b> <b>Our</b> art was being challenged in many ways as the moneymen began to sink their teeth into us.” ...|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2011, R.E.M. {{announced}} via {{its website}} {{that it was}} [...] "calling it a day as a band". Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, {{and we wanted to}} do it right, to do <b>it</b> <b>our</b> way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that we could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E
500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It will be very difficult but it is our duty to give <b>it</b> <b>our</b> best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E
