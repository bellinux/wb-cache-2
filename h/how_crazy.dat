500|$|Garbage {{later said}} that the album was {{released}} as a contractual obligation to Warner Music: [...] "This was the final straw that broke our backs", recalled Manson five years later. [...] "The record company we had been sold to in the U.K. demanded that we release a [...] "greatest hits" [...] {{in order to meet}} their quarterly requirements. We were {{not in a position to}} stop it. As a result, they shoved this collection out with no promotion whatsoever. It was right there and then that we realized <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> and out of whack things had gotten." [...] Garbage remained on hiatus for a further three years until regrouping to record their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind of People, released in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the finale}} with a B+; he praised the writers [...] "for once again {{introducing}} {{a new world}} that feels fully formed, with its own rich backstory that they could choose to explore {{if they have the}} time and the inclination." [...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are going to keep bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E
500|$|EX Media lauds Oda's art for its [...] "crispy" [...] {{monochrome}} pictures, [...] "great use {{of subtle}} shade changes" [...] on color pages, [...] "sometimes exquisite" [...] use of angles, {{and for its}} consistency. Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that [...] "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format," [...] notes that [...] "interesting things [...] going on deep in the narrative structure," [...] and recommends [...] "sticking through to the later volumes to see just <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> and Peter Max-y the art gets". Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that [...] "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." [...] He praised Oda's artwork as [...] "imaginative and creative" [...] and comments that [...] "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [...] ". He also notes that [...] "Oda's panel work [...] features {{a lot of interesting}} perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast," [...] though he complains that the panels can sometimes get [...] "a little chaotic".|$|E

5000|$|This all happens {{early in}} the film {{and there is a}} long way to go. Fortunately the film doesn't rely solely on its novelty but keeps its poetic and romantic notions alive throughout. It's a road movie, a black comedy and a romance. It's unusual alright and I like the poetic ending which arrives unexpectedly, just when you wonder <b>how</b> this <b>crazy</b> premise can {{possibly}} end." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{launch of}} the Absolute Garbage promotional {{campaign}} began {{at the end of}} May 2007, when Geffen Records updated Garbage's Myspace profile streaming audio player to include the album's lead single [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] and the remix of [...] "Bad Boyfriend", while the music video for [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] was premiered on UK Channel 4's Video Exclusive slot. Radio edits of the Guitars Up and Orchestral versions of [...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] were distributed to radio at the beginning of June. In the United Kingdom, the song was playlisted by XFM Scotland Upfront, Radio Forth and was C-Listed on BBC Radio 2 for five weeks.

[...] "Tell Me Where It Hurts" [...] was released by A Records on 7" [...] vinyl, DVD and CD single (featuring [...] "Betcha" [...] as the B-side) on July 16 in the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart.

2500|$|Others {{feel that}} {{considering}} the wellbeing of farmed insects is going too far. Rhys Southan suggests that even most vegans {{do not care}} a lot about insects, but that [...] "Insects are to animal rights what Larry Flynt is to the First Amendment – you have to uphold their rights even if you don’t want to, or the whole thing falls apart." [...] He goes on to propose satirical slogans that insect-rights activists might use against entomophagy. Wesley J. Smith rejects a proposal that [...] "We have to begin to ponder the welfare of insects we consume," [...] adding: [...] "See <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> things get once human exceptionalism is rejected?" [...] Smith cites a parody website, [...] "The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Insects." [...] The site features an article feigning concern for the insects eaten alive by contestants on Survivor.|$|E
2500|$|At {{first the}} new {{committee}} {{was named the}} Thomson Committee after its chairman, but this was soon exchanged for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. MAUD was assumed {{by many to be}} an acronym, however it is not. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. On 9 April 1940, the day Germany invaded Denmark, Niels Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended with a strange line [...] "Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing 'radium taken'. Regardless of <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> it seemed it was enough to cause concern in Britain. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and John Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named the MAUD Committee. Although the initials stood for nothing, it was officially the MAUD Committee, not the Maud Committee.|$|E

2500|$|The next morning, Piro {{has been}} brought to jail, {{where he has been}} interrogated by police about Miho's disappearance. He is able to leave jail by paying a suspiciously set low bail of about $100 US, which is {{obtained}} through a 10,000 yen bill that has been shaped into an origami 'zilla and left in the cell. [...] Piro walks back home, where he finds Miho sleeping on a beanbag in the apartment. [...] Piro and Miho then work out some of the confusion between them, which reveals several background events. [...] She explains the Analogue Support Facility as a sort of safehouse, where she was able to come and go when she wanted. Since Ping in her extreme attempt to find Miho had posted tons of pictures, videos, and information on the internet, people are now using that to [...] "build a 'real' me", as Miho explains it. During the process, at one point Kimiko calls from the studio, updating Piro on his artwork and telling him some of how last night she and others found Miho and <b>how</b> <b>crazy</b> it was.

What a sudden close to that joyous life! She {{was one of the most}} winning beings, as you truly say, that ever flashed across one's course, and if she had faults, they were those of her day and her training. I suppose, by what you say, that she was too girlish to be all the companion your brother required, and that this may account for his being more shocked than sorrow-stricken, and his child, since he can dwell on the thought, is such a new beginning of hope, that I wonder less than you do at his bearing up so well. Besides, pain dulls the feelings, and is a great occupation. I wish you could have seen that dear Bessie, but I gather that the end came on much more rapidly than had been expected. It seemed as if she were one of those to whom even suffering was strangely lightened and shortened, as if she had met only the flowers of life, and even the thorns and stings were almost lost in their bright blossoms. And she could hardly have lived on without much either of temptation or sorrow. I am glad of your testimony to Rachel's effectiveness, I wrote it out and sent it up to the Homestead. There was a note this morning requesting Edward to come in to see Maddox, and Ailie is gone with him, thinking she may get leave to see poor Maria. Think of writing 'Edward and Ailie again!
