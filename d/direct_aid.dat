25|$|Israel's {{national}} leadership established a socialist economy when Israel {{was established in}} 1948. The purpose of this approach was to establish economic self-sufficiency, particularly agriculturally, {{in the face of}} hostile neighbors and to provide jobs for a population rapidly expanding through immigration. The socialist nature of the economy created a great deal of inefficiency which the government was able to offset through foreign aid, first in the form of West German Holocaust reparations then through <b>direct</b> <b>aid,</b> primarily from western nations.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{legislation}} was enacted by US Congress to prohibit further <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> to the Contras. Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply {{them out of}} the proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986–87. Mutual exhaustion, Sandinista fears of Contra unity and military success, and mediation by other regional governments led to the Sapoa ceasefire between the Sandinistas and the Contras on March 23, 1988. Subsequent agreements were designed to reintegrate the Contras and their supporters into Nicaraguan society in preparation for general elections.|$|E

40|$|Haptic aids {{have been}} largely used in manual control tasks to {{complement}} the visual information through the sense of touch.

25|$|On 15 June, Abbas {{appointed}} Salam Fayyad {{as prime}} minister {{and gave him the}} task of forming a new government. The international community smoothly recognized the government.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{implementation}} of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> modulation, as provided for by Regulation 1259 / 99. After a critical review of the most relevant questions arisen around the effectiveness and the viability of modulation, the paper presents results about its possible application in Italy. In {{the first part of}} the paper a special attention is given to the actual distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> in Italy, to the number of farms involved and the amount of revenues realised. In the second part four different hypotheses of modulation are tested. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of modulation revenues under the four different hypotheses are compared with the financial resources allotted in Italy to the regional Rural Development Plans (RDPs). While results of modulation are, generally speaking, quite poor in terms of re-distribution of <b>direct</b> <b>aids,</b> there is a more relevant effect in terms of additional resources destined to the RDPs. However, resources are to be destined to measures that receive the highest share of resources within the RDPs. On the contrary, other measures, more genuinely addressing Rural Development and territorial issues within the RDPs, receive a much smaller amount of resources and cannot be funded through modulation. In other words, if the main objective of the modulation is that of shifting resources from the first to the second pillar of the CAP, this is only partially realised, given the mandatory destination of financial resources on measures that are substantially financed and that do not fully address the economic diversification and the development of rural areas.

25|$|A major {{obstacle}} to effective global surveillance and control of infectious diseases {{will continue to be}} the quality of national health statistical reporting by many developing countries and lack of followthrough to properly <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> and to follow recommended health care practices. Those areas of the world most susceptible to infectious disease problems are least able to develop and maintain the sophisticated and costly communications equipment needed for effective disease surveillance and reporting. In addition to the barriers dictated by low levels of development, revealing a disease outbreakmay harm national prestige, commerce, and tourism. For example, nearly every country initially denied or minimized the extent of the HIV/AIDS virus within its borders, and even today, some countries known to have significant rates of HIV infection refuse to cooperate with WHO. Only a few, such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand, have launched major preventative efforts, while many WHO members do not even endorse AIDS education in schools. Similarly, some countries deny the existence of cholera within their borders.|$|E

40|$|The 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform radically {{changes the}} way the European Union (EU) {{supports}} its agricultural sector by decoupling direct payments. Production is no longer required to get the payment attached to Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlements. However, the new scheme maintains a specific link between payments and hectares; in addition, SFP entitlements can be exchanged among farmers. These features question the way SFP entitlements should be regarded, hence modelled, i. e., as lump-sum transfers, area payments or… something else. We develop a microeconomic analytical framework which shows that the answer crucially depends on {{the total number of}} entitlements which are initially made available relative to the number of hectares, more specifically the number of cultivated hectares in a zero support regime, the number of cultivated hectares in a policy support regime trough per-hectare <b>direct</b> <b>aids,</b> and the number of cultivated or idled hectares in a policy regime where support is granted through <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> per hectare and production is not required.

25|$|A {{limiting}} factor in Yucatán's economy was the poorness of the limestone soil, which could only support crops {{for two to}} three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a {{limiting factor}} on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (cenotes), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had rights to land so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish congregación or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as mule and horse breeding, depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofradías in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching. Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofradías' cattle were used for <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.|$|E
25|$|The Mansholt Plan {{noted the}} limits to a policy of price and market support. It {{predicted}} the imbalance that would occur in certain markets unless the Community undertook to reduce its land under cultivation by at least five million hectares. Mansholt {{also noted that the}} standard of living of farmers had not improved since the implementation of the CAP despite an increase in production and permanent increases in Community expenditure. He, therefore, suggested that production methods should be reformed and modernized and that small farms, which were bound to disappear sooner or later, according to Community experts, should be increased in size. The aim of the Plan was to encourage nearly five million farmers to give up farming. That would make it possible to redistribute their land and increase the size of the remaining family farms. Farms were considered viable if they could guarantee for their owners an average annual income comparable to that of all the other workers in the region. In addition to vocational training measures, Mansholt also provided for welfare programmes to cover retraining and early retirement. Finally, he called on the Member States to limit <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> to unprofitable farms.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{unprecedented}} {{scale of the}} destruction many of the country's leading banks, businesses, institutions and local administrations have offered considerable amounts of cash {{in order to help}} the people and businesses that suffered financially due to the fires. The government has created a special account in all Greek banks, where financial help in relief of the people affected by the fire {{from all over the world}} is accepted. Additionally, financial aid from the EU is expected. Forms of assistance in nature were also offered such as olive plants contributed by a Turkish municipality and businessmen to a collect already organized in Mytilene. The Greek Government plans to spend 645.7million euros ($946.7million) to restore and rehabilitate areas burnt by the fires. This amount will be provided by both the European Union and the Greek Government. The government has earmarked 150 million euros ($222 million) to help the people affected by the fire rebuild their homes and other buildings.
