5|$|In March 2010, the Department of Defence {{revealed}} that the generators <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submarines were flawed {{and had to be}} replaced. The three Australian-made generators aboard each of the five submarines (the generators aboard Collins were French-built, and exhibited no defects) are to be replaced in the submarines as they come in for their next maintenance docking.|$|E
5|$|No {{suitable}} storms {{formed in}} the 1962 season. Next year, Stormfury began by conducting experiments on cumulus clouds. From August 17 to 20 of that year, experiments were conducted in 11 clouds, of which six were seeded and five were controls. <b>In</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six seeded clouds, changes consistent with the working hypothesis were observed.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} on to score points <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next six races on his way to moving into the top 10 in the World Drivers' Championship, the run of results {{interrupted}} only by an engine failure in Monaco. One of his best races came in Austria where despite starting from the pitlane and suffering a drive-through penalty he set the race's third fastest lap, behind only the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, finishing in 7th place.|$|E

5|$|Losses on {{both sides}} were heavy. Arrogant had been damaged early in the battle and lost seven killed and 27 wounded while Victorious which bore {{the brunt of the}} French attack, {{suffered}} 17 killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Clark. Neither British ship was in sufficient repair to continue the engagement; Arrogant had several cannon dismounted and her sail's and rigging were tattered. Victorious was less badly damaged, but had more than one <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew unfit for duty. All of the French ships suffered damage and casualties, although Régénérée reported no losses in the aftermath. Vertu was damaged early on and took 24 casualties, Seine was hit by heavy fire later in the battle and lost 62 dead and wounded, with the captain among the former. The remainder of the squadron suffered lighter losses, with 12 on Prudente, 17 on Cybèle and 23 on Forte.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E
5|$|Wisden {{believed}} that Jardine's effective batting technique meant that fast bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties {{with a few}} bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine's wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow footwork, often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he was out to slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, who took his wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.|$|E

5|$|After ranking 17th of 48 {{clubs in}} the Football League North in 1942–43, York progressed through the War Cup {{qualifying}} stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time. They were beaten 4–1 over two legs by Sheffield Wednesday. In the 1943–44 Football League North, the team finished 31st of 50 clubs, and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7–2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. York experienced selection problems in 1944–45 with many players leaving for war service; after ranking 42nd of 54 {{clubs in the}} Football League North, they then failed {{to qualify for the}} War Cup knock-out stages. They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945–46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. York finished midtable in the Third Division North (East) {{in the first half of}} the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. The FA Cup resumed this season, and for the first and only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11–1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. York made a profit <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven seasons played during the war.|$|E
5|$|Boden Fortress {{is made up}} of five primary {{self-supporting}} forts excavated out of {{the bedrock}} <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains surrounding Boden: Degerberget, Mjösjöberget, Gammelängsberget, Södra Åberget and Rödberget. Eight fortified secondary artillery positions were constructed between the forts to give flanking support and to cover areas not in range of the main forts' artillery. In addition, 40 bunkers for infantry, along with dugouts and other fortifications, were built to cover even more terrain. During the Second World War anti-tank gun emplacements and additional bunkers and shelters were built, and tens of kilometres of dragon's teeth were placed around the fortress and the city itself. Owing {{to the end of the}} Cold War and the reduction of the threat from the Soviet Union, Boden Fortress became less important to the defence of Sweden, and began to be decommissioned. The last fort of the complex was decommissioned on 31 December 1998, and is now used as a tourist attraction. All five forts as well as some of the supporting structures have been declared historic buildings, to be preserved for the future, by the Swedish government.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, Mota was {{the winning}} pitcher when he pitched a {{scoreless}} inning in an 8–7 victory over Houston. He got another win by pitching a scoreless inning on September 12 in a 6–4 victory over Florida. With the Mets, {{he had a}} 3–0 record with a 1.00 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 18 games to finish the season 4–3 with a 4.53 ERA in 52 games. He made {{the playoffs for the}} first time in his career as the Mets won the NL East. In the first game of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Dodgers, Mota was the winning pitcher when he pitched two innings, although he blew a 4–1 lead by giving up three runs and allowing the Dodgers to tie the game. Mota pitched two scoreless innings in the Mets' series-winning 9–5 victory over the Dodgers in Game 3. In the 2006 National League Championship Series, Mota appeared <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seven games in the series. He blew a lead in an eventual Game 2 loss, but he did not give up a run in the other four games as the Mets lost to St. Louis in seven games. On October 30, he filed for free agency.|$|E

5|$|The highest-scoring {{regular season}} game in {{regulation}} {{was between the}} Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. In that game, Golden State defeated Denver 162–158. The Warriors' Chris Mullin scored a game-high 38 points. The Nuggets were coached by Doug Moe from 1980 to 1990 and Paul Westhead from 1990 to 1992, both of whom employed a run and gun offensive strategy, which focuses on attempting {{a high number of}} field goals while also conceding a large number of points on defense. In fact, Moe's and Westhead's Nuggets were participants <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ten highest-scoring regular season games in NBA history. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson from 1988 to 1995 and 2006 to 2010. He employed Nellie Ball, a style of run and gun that uses smaller, more athletic players to outrun opponents. Another notable high scoring regular season game is a March 2, 1962 game between the Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks. In that game, the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain scored an NBA-record 100 points.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in late-May. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen playing in the same positions. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. Australia won the toss and batted but stumbled early. Morris was out for five and Bradman came in to join Barnes at 1/11. The pair added 160 before Barnes fell and Hassett came in to join his captain. They took the score to 200 before the Bradman fell for 98, leaving Australia at 3/200. It was Bradman's highest score under 100 in first-class cricket and in his disappointment, he was slow to leave the ground after his dismissal. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings, with Bradman catching his opposite number Norman Yardley in the second innings. Up to this point, Bradman had played <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first eight matches, {{all of which were}} won, seven by an innings. He had scored 107, 81, 146, 187 and 98, yielding a total of 619 runs at an average of 123.80.|$|E
5|$|York were {{knocked out}} of the Football League Trophy {{in the first round}} after being beaten 2–0 away by Barnsley, with the League One team scoring twice in the second half. Their first win of the season came after beating Stevenage 3–2 away. Coulson and Fletcher scored in the first half for York before Stevenage {{levelled}} the score after the break, and Fletcher scored the winning goal with a 75th-minute penalty. This was followed by York's first league defeat of the season, losing 2–0 away to league leaders Burton Albion. Goalkeeper Michael Ingham made four excellent saves in York's 0–0 draw at home to Luton Town. Danny Parslow was loaned to Conference Premier club Grimsby Town for one month, having failed to appear in the team after recovering from a long-term injury. York played Southend United at home, who took the lead early in the first half before Russell Penn equalised in first half stoppage time. The visitors scored twice during the second half before Winfield scored a consolation goal in the 85th minute, seeing the match finish a 3–2 defeat. York lost the second match in succession {{for the first time in}} 2014–15 after being beaten 2–0 away to Dagenham & Redbridge, the home team scoring in each half through Joss Labadie. Striker Ryan Brunt was signed on a one-month loan from Conference Premier club Bristol Rovers, with York's existing strikers having failed to score <b>in</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last seven matches.|$|E
