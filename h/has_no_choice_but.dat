5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} that he has decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have come and gone, due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him that he <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to kill Ozai.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the {{encounter}} with Cardinal Draclau, Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church. In their desire to control Ivalice, the Church, particularly the High Priest, Marge Funeral, uses {{the legend of the}} so-called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones, and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana. To stave off Ramza's interference, Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon, and Ramza <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to slay him/it. As a result, Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church, and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner Zalmo at Lesalia Imperial Capital.|$|E

Thus a worm with rule {1,0,5,1} decides to travel in direction 1 the first time it has to make a choice, in direction 0 the next time it has to make a choice and so on.

After, Tyrion publicly demands a trial by combat, and the mercenary Bronn volunteers to fight for him. Lysa Arryn <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to allow it. Bronn defeats Lysa's champion Ser Vardis Egen by tiring the heavily armored knight and kicking him out the Moon Door, and Tyrion is allowed to walk free with Bronn as his escort, much to the dismay of the Tully sisters.|$|E
5|$|Several {{video games}} have been retroactively {{described}} as survival horror. Nostromo {{was the first}} survival horror game developed by Akira Takiguchi, a Tokyo University student and Taito contractor, for the PET 2001. It was ported to the PC-6001 by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined Game Arts), and published by ASCII in 1981, exclusively for Japan. Inspired by the 1980 stealth game Manibiki Shoujo and the 1979 sci-fi horror film Alien, the gameplay of Nostromo involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding the sight of an invisible alien, which only becomes visible when appearing {{in front of the}} player. The gameplay also involved limited resources, where the player needs to collect certain items in order to escape the ship, and if certain required items are not available in the warehouse, the player is unable to escape and eventually <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> be killed getting caught by the alien.|$|E

When he returns home, Jess finds that {{his father and mother}} were worried sick since they didn't know where he was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the devastating effects of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to accept Leslie's death.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep {{into the back of}} the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings {{that no one can}} leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E

The Gukurahundi campaign ultimately resulted in the demise of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) when it merged with Robert Mugabe's party in 1987.

Gudrid sneaks away to Thorfinn's group who is about to set sail for Greece, hoping to make a fortune by trading Narwhal horns. Gudrid informs them of what had happened and breaks down in despair over not being able to live the life she wants because she was born a woman. Thorfinn takes pity on Gudrid and offers her to go with them, but makes it clear that she might never return alive. Gudrid eventually agrees and the group quickly leaves Iceland.

25|$|Fletcher {{argued that}} the PC party did not run on {{creating}} a new Crown corporation. That the new crown corporation went far beyond what the government had stated and included items such as potable water. His main argument is that Manitoba has a massive supply of hydro generated power and continues to build more generation {{at the cost of}} billions of dollars, with no where to sell the power. Fletcher argues that the demand side management of power usage is not appropriate in the Manitoba context. This is because supply of power will exceed the demand for power until 2044. Combine with the facts that 97% of Manitoba power generation is clean, cheap, green energy, it does not help the environment or hydro fiscal position to reduce the demand of a product that Manitoba has far too much of. In addition, due to the over building undertaken by Manitoba Hydro under the previous government, Hydro <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to raise rates. This in itself will reduce demand. The additional cost of creating a crown will increase rates further due to the huge expense.|$|E

After being {{pressured}} by the men, Thorfinn <b>has</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to accompany {{them to meet}} Thorkell, the Earl of Jelling whose land was received by King Canute. Thorfinn also meets Floki who, unbeknownst to Thorfinn, {{was the one who}} ordered Askeladd to kill his father Thors. During their meeting, Thorfinn learns that a group of Jomsvikings led by Vagn is pirating the Baltic Sea to gain fame and name himself as the new chieftain of the Jomsvikings, as the previous chieftain died before he could name a successor. Floki came to Jelling to seek aid from Thorkell in the conflict. Floki cannot become the new chieftain as their order’s code dictates that any warriors 50 years and over must retire, and the candidate Floki has in mind is too young for the order to admit. The candidate is Baldr, Floki’s grandson, as well the son of the former chieftain and grandchild of Sigvaldi, the second Jomsviking chieftain. In case a successor was not named, it’s only appropriate that the next chieftain is based on the prestige of his bloodline. To Floki’s dismay, Thorkell wants Thorfinn to become the next chieftain, as he is also the grandson of Sigvaldi and the son of Thors, the “Troll of Jom”, and currently the strongest and most valid candidate as the next Jomsviking chieftain. Thorfinn refuses the offer and returns to his companions. Thorfinn, knowing the dangers of staying in Jelling, hurries his crew to set sail immediately. All the while, Floki has plans to killing Thorsfinn while away from Thorkell’s lands.|$|E
