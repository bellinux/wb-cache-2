5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures {{his hands}} in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E
5|$|Marvel {{worked closely}} with Capcom to include {{dialogue}} quips and mid-match events between the companies' characters. Comic book writer Frank Tieri was assigned to write the character dialogue and endings for the game. Marvel also gave Tieri <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of their library of characters for storyline purposes. As a result, several unplayable characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes, such as the Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, Daredevil, MegaMan Volnutt, Nemesis, and Phoenix Wright, make cameo appearances in the campaign stages and Arcade Mode endings.|$|E
50|$|Synergetics {{coordinates}} is Clifford Nelson's {{attempt to}} describe, from another mathematical point of view, Buckminster Fuller's '60 degree coordinate system' for understanding nature. Synergetics {{is the word}} <b>Fuller</b> <b>used</b> to label his approach to mathematics.|$|R

5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E
5|$|The name Anita was retired {{following}} this storm, {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic hurricane again. Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact. Additionally, officials permitted <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid. Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm. In Texas, the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into low-lying marshland led to a mosquito outbreak near Galveston following the storm.|$|E

5|$|With {{some members}} working as dishwashers, {{the group was}} {{apparently}} not thrilled with the album being released on Ward 9. Terry Tolkin, a friend and their East Coast booking agent, signed the band to Corey Rusk's then-nascent Touch and Go Records in Detroit. Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac was released in 1984.

5|$|In 1876 and {{especially}} in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged to Anna Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became {{a focal point for}} the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting Will He Round the Point?. Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn's art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of colour. Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing {{the other members of the}} group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed to compete starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of NHL players.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, all South Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had survived the North Vietnamese assault gathered {{at the headquarters of}} the 23rd Infantry Division and Hoa Binh airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the North Vietnamese {{in the early hours of}} the day. From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and the {{soldiers who}} had gathered at the 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Hoa Binh airfield. Thieu approved the plan at dawn, and authorised Phu to make <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of three Republic of Vietnam Air Force units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base, and the 4th Air Force Division at Cần Thơ).|$|E
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term Darwinism was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 31 May Howe's fleet {{closed with}} the French, making <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of the {{advantage}} of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted. During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more. Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the <b>full</b> <b>use</b> of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E
