25|$|In the 1965–66 season, {{it quickly}} became {{apparent}} that Knowles was a notch above <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone</b> else playing in the Second Division. Among a handful of goals, he scored two hat-tricks {{early on in the}} season against Carlisle United and Derby County, making him the top scorer for the club by some way. His good form was interrupted however, as he endured the first big injury of his career. Despite missing a number of games, he managed to finish the season with 19 goals. Frustratingly for Knowles, Wolves did not manage to gain promotion that season, condemning him to another season of Second Division football. He remained at Molineux, and in the 1966–67 season Wolves finished runners-up in the Second Division and achieved promotion to the First Division.|$|E

All set to nominate Riley and Boone, the better to run them again in four years, news of the Cat arrives, preceded by his maverick cheerleaders Ned and Joe.

[...] Of the crowd's response, he said, [...] "It {{directly}} offended {{nearly half of the}} audience, as it was about the horrible tattoos people get nowadays. From attacking Japanese typography, tribal marks, lower back tattoos and any other generic overused logo, this song systematically offended <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone's</b> body art. This was the first song of the night where Courtney Jaye joined in and immediately the audience could recognize the chemistry between her and Lynch. Their duets were nearly perfect, aside from one or two minor lyrical flubs. But never before has anyone heard such beautiful voices sing such vile material together." ...|$|R

One afternoon Tae-gyu pushes Jung-hoon too far and the latter threatens Tae-gyu with a knife, an act that's witnessed by another student. Jung-hoon walks away from the situation, but shortly after the beginning of 4th period class he returns to find Tae-gyu dead. The boy has been stabbed repeatedly, and still in shock, Jung-hoon picks up the bloody knife off a nearby desk just as Da-jung (Kang So-ra) shows up, catching him in a most incriminating position. Fortunately for him, she not only believes his innocence, but offers to help him {{to solve the mystery}} and catch the real killer - a task made particularly urgent by the fact that in 40 minutes {{the rest of the class}} will return and the body will be discovered. The pair set out in search of the murderer and soon discover that <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone’s</b> a suspect and even more unsettling, the murderer is now after them as well.|$|R

John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone</b> who followed the Potter series and to please most of them".

After the two finally {{made it to the}} altar in July 1983, Tyler ran for his brother-in-law's Congressional seat, and although he lost the election, he was appointed to a special crime commission that sought to destroy an international crime cartel operating out of the Caribbean.

The things that make America great are also its greatest flaws. Not long after 9 / 11 Don Watson wrote a Quarterly Essay about Australia’s relationship with the US. Called Rabbit Syndrome, it provoked huge debate -unsurprisingly, given that America is Australia’s most important ally. But America is <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone’s</b> most important ally. So what is it that has made the US so extraordinarily successful? Why do we love it so much yet clearly loathe it at the same time?

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc. She described the storylines involving the cancer patient's intoxication and Ellis' lucidity as achieving a balance, and moving the show [...] "at a lightning quick pace". Krause deemed the episode [...] "stellar", noting how it avoided the possibility of having negative points. Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood.

Krause noted that O'Malley has developed into a hero, stating that [...] "pulling {{all the people in}} the operating room out, even though he was already sick and could have easily died from the effort" [...] in a comparison to Sloan, described as being a man with no appealing traits and [...] "unlikable ways", which attracted criticism from Krause.|$|E

[...] In 2007, he was commissioned to produce installation art at the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum in Pittsburgh.

[...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?'

The Bogarts started the trip with a junket through Europe, {{including}} a visit with Pope Pius XII. [...] Later, the glamor would be gone and Bacall would make herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer, earning her husband's praise: [...] "I don't know what we'd have done without her. She Luxed my undies in darkest Africa". [...] <b>Just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everyone</b> in the cast came down with dysentery except Bogart and Huston, who subsisted on canned food and alcohol.

[...] Hepburn, a teetotaler in and out of character, fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point falling very ill. Bogart resisted Huston's insistence on using real leeches in a key scene where Charlie has to drag his steam launch through an infested marsh, until reasonable fakes were employed. In the end, the crew overcame illness, soldier ant invasions, leaking boats, poor food, attacking hippos, poor water filters, fierce heat, isolation, and a boat fire to complete a memorable film. Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes the film apparently rekindled Bogart's early love of boats.
