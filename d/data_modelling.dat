5000|$|... it was {{determined}} that current <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> methods were imparting data isolation into every data architecture in the form of islands of disparate data and information silos. This data isolation is an unintended artifact of the <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> methodology that results in the development of disparate <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Disparate <b>data</b> <b>models,</b> when instantiated as databases, form disparate databases. Enhanced <b>data</b> <b>model</b> methodologies have been developed to eliminate the data isolation artifact and to promote the development of integrated <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> One enhanced <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> method recasts <b>data</b> <b>models</b> by augmenting them with structural metadata in the form of standardized data entities. As a result of recasting multiple <b>data</b> <b>models,</b> the set of recast <b>data</b> <b>models</b> will now share one or more commonality relationships that relate the structural metadata now common to these <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Commonality relationships are a peer-to-peer type of entity relationships that relate the standardized data entities of multiple <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> Multiple <b>data</b> <b>models</b> that contain the same standard data entity may participate in the same commonality relationship. When integrated <b>data</b> <b>models</b> are instantiated as databases and are properly populated from a common set of master data, then these databases are integrated.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of <b>data</b> <b>models</b> produced while progressing from requirements to the actual database {{to be used for}} the information system. [...] The data requirements are initially recorded as a conceptual <b>data</b> <b>model</b> which is essentially a set of technology independent specifications about the data and is used to discuss initial requirements with the business stakeholders. The conceptual model is then translated into a logical <b>data</b> <b>model,</b> which documents structures of the data that can be implemented in databases. Implementation of one conceptual <b>data</b> <b>model</b> may require multiple logical <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> The last step in <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> is transforming the logical <b>data</b> <b>model</b> to a physical <b>data</b> <b>model</b> that organizes the data into tables, and accounts for access, performance and storage details. <b>Data</b> <b>modeling</b> defines not just data elements, but also their structures and the relationships between them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Just as in {{many areas}} of {{software}} engineering, patterns have been used in <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> to create high quality <b>data</b> <b>models.</b> We provide a concept of <b>data</b> <b>model</b> pattern based on Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling (FCO-IM), a fact oriented <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> method. A <b>data</b> <b>model</b> pattern is defined as the relation between context, problem, and solution. This definition is adopted from the concept of pattern by Christopher Alexander. We define the concept of Information Grammar for Pattern (IGP) in the solution part of a pattern, which works as a template to create a <b>data</b> <b>model.</b> The IGP also shows how a pattern can relate to other patterns. The <b>data</b> <b>model</b> pattern concept is then used to describe 15 <b>data</b> <b>model</b> patterns, organized into 4 categories. A case study on geographical location is provided to show the use of the concept in a real case.

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>modeling</b> is the {{technique}} of identifying entities, associating attributes to the entities and deciding the data structure to represent the attributes. In the traditional database scenario, a logical <b>data</b> <b>model</b> is created at the beginning to represent the entities and their associated attributes. In evolutionary <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> {{the technique}} of <b>data</b> <b>modeling</b> is performed in an iterative manner, that is multiple <b>data</b> <b>models</b> are developed, each model representing a different aspect of the database.
