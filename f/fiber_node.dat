50|$|A G.fast FTTdp <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> has the {{approximate}} {{size of a}} large shoebox and can be mounted on a pole or underground. In a FTTB (fiber to the basement) deployment, the <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> is {{in the basement of a}} multi-dwelling unit (MDU) and G.fast is used on the in-building telephone cabling. In a fiber to the front yard scenario, each <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> serves a single home. The <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> may be reverse-powered by the subscriber modem. For the backhaul of the FTTdp <b>fiber</b> <b>node,</b> the Broadband Forum's FTTdp architecture provides GPON, XG-PON1, EPON, 10G-EPON, point-to-point fiber Ethernet, and bonded VDSL2 as options.|$|E
50|$|FTTF (fiber-to-the-frontage) This is {{very similar}} to FTTB. In a fiber to the front yard scenario, each <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> serves a single subscriber. This allows for {{multi-gigabit}} speeds using XG-fast technology. The <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> may be reverse-powered by the subscriber modem.|$|E
5000|$|Return path {{alignment}} and headend combining: Independently {{develop the}} [...] "X-point" [...] return path alignment and amplitude compensation process. Due to the Amplitude Modulation (AM) {{format of the}} return path FP lasers, a +25 dBmV CW tone injected at the <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> status monitoring module would not arrive at the headend with constant amplitude. Pad inputs to frequency translator to ensure +5 dBmV input on this tone for each <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> (individually).|$|E
50|$|The 7 {{frequency}} translators + 7 Channelmizers supported 65,000 homes {{passed on}} 23 <b>fiber</b> <b>nodes,</b> and occupied a full rack.|$|R
50|$|A Network Support Site code {{represents}} any non-building structures {{or outside}} plant {{equipment such as}} Wireless Access Points, International Boundary Crossing Points, End-Points, <b>Fiber</b> <b>Nodes,</b> Junctions, Manholes, Poles, Base Transceiver Station / Radio Equipment and Repeaters.|$|R
50|$|CUseeME and Apple QuickTime Conferencing 1.0 beta {{ran over}} the Zenith and Lancity {{proprietary}} cable modems when the RF path was sufficiently clean. These modems {{were able to}} interoperate on the same RF <b>fiber</b> <b>nodes</b> using Frequency Division Multiplexing, using an Ethernet switch to join the otherwise incompatible networks.|$|R
5000|$|In cable {{television}} systems (CATV), this term has assumed a broader context and is generally {{associated with a}} fiber optic node. This {{can be defined as}} those homes or businesses within a specific geographic area that are served from a common fiber optic receiver. A fiber optic node is generally described {{in terms of the number}} of [...] "homes passed" [...] that are served by that specific <b>fiber</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E
50|$|R-ONUs convert optical signals into {{electrical}} ones. This is done {{in place}} of the same function traditionally performed back at the higher-level serving area nodes in the HFC network. The RF infrastructure remains in place; the difference is that the fiber termination is moved from a <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> to the customer's premises. The R-ONU can be located in any type of premises: a home, a business, a multi-tenant dwelling (MTU/MDU), or apartments in an MTU.|$|E
5000|$|In late 1993, Zenith Electronics and Prodigy {{provided}} 12 modified 500 Kbit [...] "white modems" [...] to Cox Communications in San Diego, {{including two}} with IBM Microchannel support. These modified modems {{were intended to}} support the Prodigy Cable Modem trial, which began on a 1500 homes-passed <b>fiber</b> <b>node</b> in El Cajon, CA. The modification allowed sub-split operation, with a fixed upstream frequency and a downstream at 74.75 MHz, within the 4 MHz space between analog channels 4 and 5.|$|E
50|$|Prodigy was {{deployed}} over {{cable modem}} to 200 users {{in time for}} the 1994 Western Cable Show. To grow the system from 16 users in 3 <b>fiber</b> <b>nodes,</b> to 200 required adding what became 64,000 homes passed, making the Cox San Diego / Prodigy cable modem field trial the world's largest cable modem deployment (by service area) at the time.|$|R
50|$|His refined {{histological}} {{techniques and}} his work on both injured and normal nerve fibers became world-renowned. His observations on <b>fiber</b> <b>nodes</b> and the degeneration and regeneration of cut fibers had a great influence on Parisian neurology at the Salpêtrière. Soon afterwards, he discovered gaps in sheaths of nerve fibers, which were later called the Nodes of Ranvier. This discovery later led Ranvier to careful histological examination of myelin sheaths and Schwann cells.|$|R
5000|$|The initial trial {{consisted}} of a Prodigy server in the El Cajon headend, connected via the Microchannel-based cable modem to an Olsen Frequency Translator. This basic network supported the 1500 home passed <b>fiber</b> <b>nodes,</b> with six [...] "subscribers" [...] including one employee of Cox, who was also the head-end manager. One card was installed in rackmount PC in the Federal headend, another in the El Cajon headend. 1500 high pass filters were installed to eliminate any ingress from the drops. Service was reasonably reliable.|$|R
50|$|A typical CMTS is {{a device}} which hosts {{downstream}} and upstream ports (its functionality {{is similar to}} the DSLAM used in a DSL system). While downstream and upstream communications travel on a shared coax line in the customer premises, and connect to a single F connector on the cable modem, it is typical for the CMTS to have separate F connectors for downstream and for upstream communication. This allows flexibility for the cable operator. Because of the noise in the return (upstream) path, an upstream port is usually connected to a single neighborhood (<b>fiber</b> <b>node),</b> whereas a downstream port is usually shared across a small number of neighborhoods. Thus, there are generally more upstream ports than downstream ports on a CMTS. A typical CMTS has four or six upstream ports per downstream port.|$|E
50|$|The Broadband Forum is {{investigating}} architectural aspects of G.fast and has, as of May 2014, identified 23 use cases. Deployment scenarios involving G.fast bring fiber {{closer to the}} customer than traditional VDSL2 FTTN (fiber to the node), but not quite to the customer premises as in FTTH (fiber to the home). The term FTTdp (fiber to the distribution point) is commonly associated with G.fast, similar to how FTTN is associated with VDSL2. In FTTdp deployments, {{a limited number of}} subscribers at a distance of up to 200-300 m are attached to one <b>fiber</b> <b>node,</b> which acts as DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM). As a comparison, in ADSL2 deployments the DSLAM may be located in a central office (CO) at a distance of up to 5 km from the subscriber, while in some VDSL2 deployments the DSLAM is located in a street cabinet and serves hundreds of subscribers at distances up to 1 km. VDSL2 is also widely used in fiber to the basement.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fiber</b> optic <b>node</b> has a {{broadband}} optical receiver, which converts the downstream optically {{modulated signal}} {{coming from the}} headend or hub to an electrical signal going to the homes. , the downstream signal is a RF modulated signal that typically begins at 50 MHz and ranges from 550-1000 MHz on the upper end. The <b>fiber</b> optic <b>node</b> also contains a reverse- or return-path transmitter that sends communication from the home back to the headend. In North America, this reverse signal is a modulated RF ranging from 5-42 MHz while {{in other parts of}} the world, the range is 5-65 MHz. The optical coupler combined with the optical receiver forms a node.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically-produces bamboo {{fiber and}} bamboo rayon have {{markedly}} different properties. They look different under a {{scanning electron microscope}} (the mechanically-produced <b>fiber</b> has <b>nodes).</b> Bamboo rayon varies in physical properties, {{as would be expected}} from the range of properties in other rayon.|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for {{the calculation of}} single myelinated fiber action potentials in an unbounded homogeneous medium and in nerve cuff electrodes. The model consists of a fiber model, {{used to calculate the}} action currents at the nodes of Ranvier, and a cylindrically symmetrical volume conductor model in which the <b>fiber's</b> <b>nodes</b> are represented as point current sources. The extracellular action potentials were shown to remain unchanged if the fiber diameter and the volume conductor geometry are scaled by the same factor (principle of corresponding states), both in an unbounded homogeneous medium and in an inhomogeneous volume conductor. The influence of several cuff electrode parameters, among others, cuff length and cuff diameter, were studied, and the results were compared, where possible, with theoretical and experimental results as reported in the literature...|$|R
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} VRAD systems {{currently}} used by AT&T: FTTN (<b>fiber</b> to the <b>node),</b> and FTTP (<b>fiber</b> to the premises).|$|R
40|$|Digital microfluidics: an {{easy way}} to {{encapsulate}} successively water droplets by oil. Digital microfluidics is implemented to coat successively water droplets with a thin layer of silicon oil. Small water droplets are settled at three <b>fibers</b> <b>nodes</b> while a larger oil drop slides down the vertical fiber. Optofluidics: an interesting way to reveal the droplet sliding motion and the encapsulation. To distinguish the different fluids, quantum dots (QDs) and rhodamine labelled polystyrene beads are diluted in oil and water, respectively. These two fluorescent probes are lighted by a 532 nm radiation. The fluorescence signal is recorded by a high speed camera, perpendicularly to the laser and to the fibers network. This set-up reveals that the oil drop passes through the water droplets without removing them from the nodes, leaving a thin oil layer around the water droplets. The coating, clearly seen on top pictures of Fig 2, prevents water evaporation. The key parameters for a good encapsulation are the fiber diameter and the oil viscosity that determine droplets size and velocity, respectively...|$|R
50|$|An internodal segment (or internode) is {{the portion}} of a nerve <b>fiber</b> between two <b>Nodes</b> of Ranvier. The {{neurolemma}} or primitive sheath is not interrupted at the nodes, but passes over them as a continuous membrane.|$|R
50|$|The DACS is {{responsible}} for reporting <b>fiber</b> failures and <b>node</b> failures that occur within the office to the RNC. In addition, the DACS enables automatic restoration by providing the central processor access to remotely perform cross-connects at the DS-3 level.|$|R
50|$|Failure {{recovery}} {{is a crucial}} in all types of networks. The MPLS {{as well as the}} IP network uses the high speed capabilities of modern optical networks. SRLGs typically deal with links between <b>fiber</b> optic <b>nodes,</b> but that is not always the case. SRLG can also be modeled if the links contain transmission lines instead of fiber optic cable. SRG modeling is also used when a provider generates a service-level agreement with a client with various protection schemes.|$|R
50|$|In current HFC systems, a {{fiber optic}} network {{extending}} from the operator's head end carries all video channels out to a <b>fiber</b> optic <b>node</b> which services any number of homes ranging from 1 to 2000. From this point, all channels are sent via coaxial cable {{to each of the}} homes. Note that only a percentage of these homes are actively watching channels at a given time. Rarely are all channels being accessed by the homes in the service group.|$|R
50|$|This optical {{transmitter}} converts the electrical signal to a downstream optically modulated signal that {{is sent to}} the <b>nodes.</b> <b>Fiber</b> optic cables connect the headend or hub to optical nodes in a point-to-point or star topology, or in some cases, in a protected ring topology.|$|R

50|$|Assume {{a failure}} free state for a path from a node B to a node A. Node B bridges the signal destined to A from other nodes on the ring, both on working and {{protecting}} routes. At node A, signals {{from these two}} routes are continuously monitored for path layer defects and the better quality signal is selected.Now consider a failure state where <b>fiber</b> between <b>node</b> A and node B is cut. The selector switches traffic on the standby route when the active route between node A and node B is failed.|$|R
50|$|In optical mesh networks, nodes are {{junctions}} of <b>fiber</b> spans. Some <b>nodes</b> might contain {{highly sophisticated}} routing equipment— while {{others may be}} just a patch panel. Whatever the case, a node is a shared risk node group—because if the node fails, the failure affects all signals through that particular node.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{off-line}} wavelength assignment problem in star and ring networks that deploy multiple <b>fibers</b> between <b>nodes</b> and use Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) for transmission. The results {{in this paper}} show {{that the ability to}} switch between fibers increases wavelength utility. In particular, sharper per-fiber bounds on the number of required wavelengths are derived for the multifiber version of the assignment problem in star and ring networks. Additionally, the complexity of the problem is studied and several constrained versions of the problem are also considered for star and ring networks. A summary of contributions is provided in the first section...|$|R
50|$|In cable TV {{systems in}} the United States, {{equipment}} in the home sends a channel request signal back to the distribution hub. If a channel is not currently being transmitted on the coaxial line, the distribution hub allocates a new QAM channel and transmits the new channel to the coaxial cable via the <b>fiber</b> optic <b>node.</b> For this to work, the equipment in the home must have two-way communication ability.

40|$|Importance of soil-structure {{interaction}} during earthquake ground motions has been emphasized by damages in the structures in recent earthquakes. Currently available analytical tools to consider {{soil-structure interaction}} oversimplify {{the interaction between}} soil and structure and they lack proper calibration with full-scale testing.
