40|$|Owing to {{the high}} cost of {{transporting}} farm produce before the railway age, the land-intensiveness of European mixed farming caused both production and consumption of foodstuffs and <b>intermediate</b> <b>farm</b> inputs in the steady state to be highly dispersed, a spatial configuration offering weak inducement to reorganize farm structure or to invest available labour and capital with a view to increasing output. In such conditions {{the most common cause of}} rising agricultural productivity was spatial concentration of demand, which raised the demand price of farm produce and farm inputs within the privileged space bounded by discontinuities in the cost of land transport. The ultimate cause of observed changes in agricultural productivity before the nineteenth century must therefore be sought outside the farming sector in the development of markets for tradable manufactures, tradable services, and the economies of scale in their provision that supported spatial concentration of population. ...|$|E
40|$|Investigation was {{conducted}} into the production, processing, marketing and utilization of okra in Egbedore Local Government of Osun state, Nigeria. Data was collected {{through the use}} of well-structured questionnaire and field observations from 100 okra farmers using simple random sampling technique. The data collected was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that {{the mean age of the}} respondents was 57. 56 years with a standard deviation of 9. 28 years. All the respondents are males and married. Women do not own personal okra farms but they do work with their husband on the family farms and mostly involved independently at the processing, preservation and marketing levels more than at the production level. About 49. 0 % of the respondents did not have any formal education while 51. 0 % were literates who have access to <b>intermediate</b> <b>farm</b> technology. The mean years of okra production experience is 16. 91 years and the mean okra farm size is 3. 64 acres with standard deviation of 2. 58 acres. All the respondents practiced mixed cropping where other crops such as yam, banana, pineapples, cassava and others were planted with okra. Land preparation for okra production includes land clearing, ploughing, harrowing and heaping or ridging. About 80. 0 % of the okra farmers used cutlass and hoe regularly, which might have been responsible for okra production at subsistence or small-scale level. Only 20. 0 % of the okra farmers employed use of tractor. Majority of the farmers hired labour to supplement family labour. The mean persons day of family labour was 6. 03 and that of hired labour was 1. 25 persons day. Processing and preservation are carried out using traditional techniques of slicing, sun drying and grinding (using mortar and pestle). Sliced and dried okra are stored in gourd, basket and clay-pots. Fresh okra are put in basket lined with leave for maximum of three days during which it is marketed on retail and wholesale basis. Okra is consumed fresh and dried mostly to make draw soup by 81. 0 % of the respondents. Positive and significant relationships existed between socioeconomic characteristics of respondents investigated and total yield of okra produced. The r-value for variable related to land preparation and operation are low, between r = 0. 234 and r = 0. 470. The r-value of variables related to farm size and output (yield) are very high between r = 0. 550 and r = 0. 922, which spelt out a situation tending towards a perfect relationship. There is also sharp difference in the r-value of farm size for okra (0. 922) and farm size for other crops (0. 550). It therefore means that okra yield depends on the size of the farm...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} U. S. farm level {{investment in}} machinery, equipment and structures between 1996 - 2013. A synthetic panel is constructed using annual cross-sectional farm level observations from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). Cohorts are formed by grouping farms into similar categories based upon farm production type, region and farm typology. This methodology allows {{the use of}} fixed effects to control for cohort specific and time-invariant similarities in investment levels, addresses non-investment in a single period by using cohort average investment rates, and allows links between investment levels and other key determinants across cohorts over time. ^ Within farm typologies, farms are classified based on levels of gross cash farm income (GCFI) and operator primary occupation. Commercial farms have GCFI greater or equal to $ 350, 000. Resident farms have GCFI less than $ 350, 000 and a primary operator occupation other than <b>farming.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> <b>farms</b> also have GCFI less than $ 350, 000 but identify their primary occupation as farming. Making these distinctions is important if investment behavior is related both to GCFI levels and primary occupation. ^ Previous studies find differences between in farm capital investment rates and changes in sales or income measurements, tax policy variables, and cash flow measurements based on farm size and levels of off-farm income. To test if these same relationships hold when using the ARMS data and farm typology categories, I develop three hypotheses based upon these three commonly found and/or asserted relationships. The three hypothesis developed are that {{compared to the other}} farm typologies there is a greater increase in investment rates given: 1) an increase in output prices and returns on investment for commercial farms, 2) changes in tax policy variables for resident farms, and 3) changes in measures of credit constraints for <b>intermediate</b> <b>farms.</b> I test these hypotheses by allowing these key coefficients to vary across farm typologies. Given the results of these tests, I find evidence to support the first two hypotheses, though this varies by commodity type, but little evidence to support the third. ^ Using the estimated model, changes in specific model coefficients are used to explain differences in investment levels in 2013 vs. 1996 and to estimate average farm investment levels in 2024. Changes in farm capital investment in 1996 vs. 2013 can be attributed to changes in output prices, interest rates and year specific impacts. Decreases in net farm incomes on commercial grain and livestock farms, declining output prices for <b>intermediate</b> livestock <b>farms,</b> lower bonus tax depreciation expense limits on resident livestock farms, and rising interest rates for grain farms across typologies lead to large declines in average farm investment in 2024 compared to 2013. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Post-weaning {{diarrhoea}} (PWD) is {{a significant}} gastrointestinal disease in pigs. It is considered a multifactorial disease associated with proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the intestinal tract of affected pigs. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse risk factors related to the occurrence of PWD on Finnish piglet producing farms. Methods The data of a follow-up study of 73 conventional piglet producing farms was used in the case-control study. The selection of the 41 PWD case and 28 control farms was based on the use of antimicrobials for treating diarrhoea in weaned pigs and the answers related to the occurrence of diarrhoea after weaning in the questionnaire. Four <b>intermediate</b> <b>farms</b> were excluded from the statistical analysis. Altogether 39 factors related to herd characteristics, weaner pig management and pig health were studied. The median number of sows was 59. 0 (IQR = 44. 0; 74. 5) and 52. 5 (IQR = 36. 8; 61. 5) on the case and the control farms, respectively. The significances of the univariable associations between the explanatory variables and the outcome variable were tested, and in the multivariate analysis quasibinomial generalized linear models were applied. Results An increased risk of PWD was associated with the regimen of twice a day feeding and feed restriction after weaning (P = 0. 02; compared to feeding three or more meals a day or the use of ad libitum feeding) and with a higher number of sows on the farm (P = 0. 02; risk increasing with increasing number of sows). Automatic temperature control was associated with a decreased risk of PWD (P = 0. 03; compared to manual temperature control). Conclusion Twice a day feeding of newly-weaned pigs should be avoided if the amount of feed given is restricted. Variation in ambient temperature should be minimized in housing of newly-weaned pigs and this can be achieved by using automatic temperature control. With increasing number of sows in the herds the risk of PWD increases and more attention should be paid to prevention of post-weaning diarrhoea. </p...|$|R

40|$|System innovations, {{comprising}} {{changes of}} socio-technical networks, rules and routines governing particular fields of practice, are {{generally regarded as}} essential to a transition towards sustainability. Different scholars have tried to unravel the pathways of system innovations {{in order to understand}} how system innovations can be stimulated or facilitated as part of transition management. This paper aims to contribute to the knowledge on system innovation pathways by studying the development of care farming as cross-sector system innovation. Care farming is a rapidly expanding form of multifunctional agriculture that combines agricultural production with offering day-care to a diversity of clients. It emerged when a few pioneers started to provide care services at their farms and successfully integrated the different regimes governing the quite distinct fields of agriculture and care. Since then, the number of care farms increased dramatically. A new <b>intermediate</b> care <b>farming</b> regime evolved comprising new rules and routines, embedded in regionally and nationally organized networks of care farmers which are increasingly acknowledged by the healthcare sector. Our findings suggest that at a niche level farmer strategies of (individual and collective) alignment and self empowerment facilitate the development and maturation of a new regime. At a regime level supporting pioneers, creating room for experimentation, and looking beyond sector borders are factors that contribute to the successful realisation of system innovation...|$|R
40|$|Farm {{machinery}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} capital demanding areas of a farm operation. The value of farm machinery and motor vehicles in the United States in 1969 was approximately $ 32. 6 Billion, representing nearly 12 percent of the total assets of farmers. Efficient capital management is an essential element in a successful farm operation. With the increase in farm size and the adoption of labor saving, larger mechanized units, Nebraska farmers are left with limited amounts of short run capital available for yearly operating expenses. At the same time, farmers have been plagued with a substantial increase in interest rates since 1960. Even further alarming is that certain major lending agencies have restricted credit availability for <b>intermediate</b> term <b>farm</b> machinery financing, being more interested in short term lending. The primary objective of this study is to determine the least cost method of acquiring the long term use of farm machinery for Nebraska farmers with respect to the alternative financing methods of (1) leasing, (2) credit purchasing, and (3) cash purchasing. Secondary objectives of this study are as follows: a) To determine what is being offered to Nebraska farmers in terms of lease and credit plans, and possible future expectations of the utilization of leasing. b) To determine the effect of various depreciation methods (with purchase agreements) on cost of acquiring the long term use of farm machinery. c) To determine the effect of an operator’s tax bracket on cost of acquiring the long term use of farm machinery. d) To determine the effect of an operator’s opportunity cost of capital on the cost of the long term use of farm machinery.

The project has been carried out as a case study on the potential for conversion to organic production for Grønstvedt farm in Ski, Norway. Grønstvedt farm has been in the Solberg family since 1905 and is a mixed farm with 40 hectares of arable land and 14 dairy cows. Knut Solberg began conversion of part of the land in 1996 because of increasing consumer demand for organic products. Today the farm is in a generation transition state, with Knut’s eldest son, Tor Jakob Solberg, taking over the full-time management of Grønstvedt farm. Tor Jakob is considering many things for his future life on the farm, including full conversion of all land and livestock to organic production. In this project we have tried to work out some scenarios in cooperation with Tor Jakob Solberg. We have chosen two scenarios, which do not require a large investment, as proposals for conversion. In the first scenario we propose conversion of the farm with the present production, although linseed is included as a new crop.

We also delved deeper into local land-use changes in order to identify the main socioeconomic drivers and ruling agencies at stake. A second degree polynomial regression was obtained linking socio-metabolic disturbance and landscape ecological functioning (jointly assessing landscape patterns and processes). The results confirm our intermediate disturbance-complexity hypothesis by showing a hump-shaped relationship where the highest level of landscape complexity (heterogeneity connectivity) is attained when disturbance peaks at 50 – 60 %.

40|$|One widely {{recognized}} strategy to meet future food needs is {{reducing the amount}} of arable land used to produce livestock feed. Of all livestock products, beef is the largest land user per unit output. Whether beef production results in feed-food competition or a net positive contribution to the food supply, however, may depend largely on whether marginal land is used to grow forage. The land use ratio (LUR) was developed by van Zanten et al. (2016 a) to identify livestock systems that produce more animal source food than would be produced by converting their associated feed land to food crop production – a perspective that is not addressed within life cycle assessment (LCA). van Zanten et al. (2016 a) used country-specific and farm-level land suitability data, the latter of which is not available in many countries. To assess the LUR of beef systems in the USA, which may use large grassland areas of potentially varying quality across scales, an <b>intermediate</b> approach between <b>farm</b> and country-scale estimation is needed. In this paper, we enhanced the LUR by integrating geospatial data for crop suitability and yield estimation at multiple scales. By doing so, the LUR will also become more widely applicable for other studies. We applied our enhanced LUR for a grass-fed beef (GF) system and a dairy beef (DB) system in the Northeastern USA, including multiple scenarios limiting land conversion. All systems had LURs greater than one, indicating they produce less protein than conversion of their suitable feed land base to food cropping would. Because a large fraction of the forage land used in the GF system was suitable for crop production and moderately productive, its LUR was 3 – 6 times larger (less efficient land use from a food supply perspective) than the DB system. Future research should explore mechanisms to reduce the LUR and life cycle environmental burdens of both regional production systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{awareness}} of widespread hunger and poverty {{in many countries}} in the SSA is spurring a focus on productivity increase in smallholder farming systems. The rationale is that with current production systems many SSA countries are not keeping pace with population growth and changing of peoples’ lifestyles. To respond to this challenge the Government of Mozambique developed its Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) aiming to improve agricultural productivity {{of the majority of}} smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Smallholder farmers are diverse in terms of resources and aspirations. The main objectives of this study are first to understand the diversity among maize-based smallholder farms and their current constraints in improving agricultural productivity in the Manica Plateau, Central Mozambique, and second, building on that understanding to explore options for biomass production either for food, cash or biofuel at farm level and contributions to maize availability in the region. The study was conducted in the Dombe and Zembe Administrative Posts. Farmers in the two posts cultivate both food and cash crops using the same resources, however, distances to the urban market differ, with Zembe close and Dombe far away from the markets. In addition, the agroecological conditions for crop production are more favourable in Dombe compared with Zembe. Using farm surveys, direct observations and on-farm measurements, followed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) I identified land and labour as the variables that can best explain the variability found among smallholder farms (Chapter 2). Based on these variables I categorised farms into four Farm Types (FT) : FT 1. Large farms (4. 4 ha in Dombe and 2. 2 ha in Zembe), hiring in labour; FT 2. <b>Intermediate</b> sized <b>farms</b> (1. 9 - 1. 2 ha), hiring in and out labour; FT 3 a. Small farms (1. 1 - 0. 9 ha), sharing labour; and FT 3 b. Small farms (1. 0 - 0. 7 ha), hiring out labour. The maize yield and maize labour productivities were higher on large farms (2. 3 t ha- 1 in Dombe and 2. 0 t ha- 1 in Zembe; 2. 5 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Dombe and 2. 6 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Zembe) compared with small farms (1. 5 t ha- 1 in Dombe and 1. 1 t ha- 1 in Zembe; 1. 4 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Dombe and 0. 9 × 10 - 3 t h- 1 in Zembe). The hiring in labour from small farms allowed large farms to timely weed their fields. Small farms were resource constrained and hired out labour (mutrakita) for cash or food to the detriment of weeding their own fields, resulting in poor crop yields. Excessive alcohol consumption by small farms also raised concerns on labour quality. Chapter 3 explored options aiming at addressing farmers’ objectives of being maize self-sufficient and increased gross margin and the contribution to national objective of producing food. A bio-economic farm model was used to investigate two pathways to increase agricultural production: (i) extensification, expanding the current cultivated area; and (ii) intensification, increasing input use and output per unit of land. In the extensification pathway I considered the use of animal traction, herbicides and cultivators to save labour, whereas in the intensification pathway I explored the use improved varieties of maize, sesame, sunflower, pigeonpea and fertilizers. I focused on the large farms and the small farms hiring out labour as they represent both sides of the spectrum. The simulated results showed that combining labour and labour saving technologies substantially increased both gross margin and maize yields of large and small farms in both posts. Minor trade-offs is observed on large farms between the two goals whereas for small farms we see synergies between the goals. We concluded that prospects for increasing gross margin and food production are much better for large farms in Dombe compared with other farms. In Dombe, the maximum gross margin of large farms was 7530 $ y- 1 per farm and maximum maize sales of 30. 4 t y- 1 per farm. In Zembe, the maximum gross margin of large farms (2410 $ y- 1 per farm) and maximum maize sales (9. 5 t y- 1 per farm) were comparable to small farms in Dombe. I further assessed the impact of two biofuel investments (jatropha plantation and sunflower outgrower schemes) on farm level food security (food availability, access to food, stability of food, utilization of food). The results showed positive impact on small farms from employment on a jatropha plantation by increasing access to food and no impacts on <b>intermediate</b> and large <b>farms.</b> Impacts on food security from the sunﬂower outgrower scheme were minor which may be explained by the poor yields. The need to link smallholder farmers to markets has been increasingly recognized as important strategy to promote rural development and poverty reduction. I developed an analytical framework, the Windmill Approach that looked at decision making at farm level to grow certain crops and at transaction strategies (Chapter 5). Through this framework I showed that a farmer decision to participate in a particular (new) value chain is determined by (a) the suitability of the new crop in the farm system (including the adaptability of the current farm system), and (b) the farmer’s experience with selling in various value chains. This has major policy implications as it highlights that to support smallholder farmers access to markets a holistic approach is needed that combines farming systems analysis and transaction cost theory. In order to explore the opportunities for smallholder development there is need to understand the diversity of farms and farmers’ social and economic context. For large farms, in Central Mozambique farms with on average 2 - 4 ha of land, opportunities to improve their livelihoods through crop production can follow two pathways: intensification and extensification. Smallholders continue to produce staple food crops even when working on a plantation or participating in outgrower schemes. For small farms, off-farm opportunities such as those in a biofuel plantation are the best options to improve their livelihoods...|$|R
40|$|Changes in modem {{agriculture}} {{have been}} shown to have detrimental affects on those bird species whose populations mainly inhabit the wider countryside. Recently extensive changes to the farmed landscape have occurred through implementation of European agricultural policy much of which has been concerned with decreasing agricultural production. Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), with almost the entire British population breeding on farmland, is a species that is thought to have been particularly affected by agricultural change. A study attempting to assess the impact that modern, intensive arable farming had on a breeding population of lapwing was undertaken from 1995 to 1997 in south-west Lancashire. The study site had an open character and was predominantly winter farmed (cultivation occurring September-February) although {{more than a third of}} the area was spring cultivated. Permanent pasture and rotational set-aside (RSA) accounted for about 2 % and 5 % of the cropped area respectively. Lapwings preferred to nest in spring farmed fields and RSA. The overall nest survival was 55. 5 % and did not differ significantly between years. Hatching success was highest in RSA (88 %), lowest in spring farmed fields (48. 4 %) and <b>intermediate</b> in winter <b>farmed</b> fields (57. 2 %). Hatching success was significantly higher in spring farmed fields than in other habitats but did not differ significantly between winter and spring farmed fields. The hatching success of winter farmed fields was elevated by the success of nests of fields cultivated late in the winter. The main cause of nest losses was farming operations which caused 77. 4 % of all nests lost. Predation accounted for 14. 4 % of nest losses and desertion for 8. 2 %. There were annual differences in nest destruction in winter farmed crops caused by differences in the timing of agricultural operations. Nest destruction was highest in unsown fields but was compensated for by a high rate of replacement and high hatching success in replacement clutches. Two types of crop were spring farmed, combinable (mainly cereals) and vegetable (mainly potatoes) crops. Higher hatching 2 success in spring cereals than in vegetables was related to the differing intensities of management between the two crop categories. Lapwing preferred to nest in dense aggregations and far from ditches both of which reduced the risk of predation. Low densities of nest predators were maintained in the study area by predator control. Chicks from larger eggs survived better than chicks from smaller eggs. Chicks undertaking movements from natal to rearing fields suffered high levels of mortality. Chick mortality was caused by poor body condition, entrapment in field boundary ditches or predation or from the interaction of these factors. Brood movements were influenced by the distribution of crop types. Spring farmed fields and pasture were used for rearing broods. Predation was the main proximate cause of mortality for radio-marked chicks and accounted for 52 % of all losses. Predation was a significant mortality factor until chicks were at least 20 days old, whereas poor body condition (31 % of all radio-marked chick losses) and ditch entrapment (17 % of all losses) only killed very young chicks. Fledging success or hatching success is thought to be the main limit on productivity. Dietary studies revealed chicks ate mainly beetles but their diet varied depending upon rearing location. Surface living chick prey was abundant throughout the season in arable fields and late-hatched chicks suffered higher mortality than those hatched earlier mainly due to an increase in predation late in the season. Recommendations to maintain or improve the conditions for breeding lapwing within the study site are discussed. They include proposals which could operate under the agrienvironment regulations of the CAP, such as an increase in the area spring farmed with the cultivation of both cereal and vegetables and changes to the management of rotational set-aside to make such fields more suitable for brood rearing...|$|R
