5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis is}} that the Earth–Moon system formed {{as a result of}} the impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth (giant impact), that blasted material into orbit about the <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> then accreted to form the present Earth-Moon system.|$|E

5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator for about 185 days of each year, and south of it for about 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E
5|$|Battlefield Earth (also {{referred}} to as Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000) is a 2000 American science fiction action film based upon {{the first half of}} L. Ron Hubbard's 1982 novel of the same name. Directed by Roger Christian and starring John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker, the film depicts an <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> has been under the rule of the alien Psychlos for 1,000 years and {{tells the story of the}} rebellion that develops when the Psychlos attempt to use the surviving humans as gold miners.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the <b>Earth)</b> <b>that</b> in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} life on Earth is not well understood, but it {{is known to have}} {{occurred}} at least 3.5billion years ago, during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> had a substantially different environment than is found at present. These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.|$|E

5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance {{as they were}} used to gain the first realistic estimates {{of the size of the}} Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E
50|$|Inverse {{modeling}} is {{a mathematical}} technique where {{the objective is}} to determine the physical properties of the subsurface of an <b>earth</b> region <b>that</b> has produced a given seismogram. Cooke and Schneider (1983) defined it as calculation of the earth’s structure and physical parameters from some set of observed seismic data. The underlying assumption in this method is that the collected seismic data are from an <b>earth</b> structure <b>that</b> matches the cross-section computed from the inversion algorithm. Some common <b>earth</b> properties <b>that</b> are inverted for include acoustic velocity, formation and fluid densities, acoustic impedance, Poisson's ratio, formation compressibility, shear rigidity, porosity, and fluid saturation.|$|R

5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the <b>earth</b> <b>that</b> the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|It {{was on the}} set of {{his first}} major film, The Man Who Fell to <b>Earth,</b> <b>that</b> Bowie began writing a pseudo-autobiography called The Return of the Thin White Duke. He was also {{composing}} music on the understanding that he was to provide the picture's soundtrack, though this would not come to fruition. (At Bowie's recommendation, John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas would write and produce all the original music for the film instead.) Director Nicolas Roeg warned the star that the part of Thomas Jerome Newton would likely remain with him for some time after production completed. With Roeg's agreement, Bowie developed his own look for the film, and this carried through to his public image and onto two album covers over the next twelve months, as did Newton's air of fragility and aloofness.|$|E
5|$|Professor Calculus, Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, and Calculus' {{assistant}} Frank Wolff are aboard {{an atomic}} rocket-powered spacecraft leaving the Earth {{bound for the}} Moon. Soon after takeoff they discover that the detectives Thomson and Thompson have accidentally stowed away onboard, putting a strain on the oxygen supply. The detectives accidentally turn off the nuclear motor, disrupting the artificial gravity and sending everyone floating until Tintin corrects the problem. They then suffered a relapse of the Formula 14 drug (seen in Land of Black Gold (1950)), resulting in their hair growing rapidly in multiple colours. Calculus subsequently administers a cure. Haddock, who has smuggled whisky aboard the rocket, gets drunk and takes an impromptu spacewalk, during which he briefly becoming a satellite of the asteroid Adonis (at which point, Professor Calculus humorously says he will tell <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> Adonis has a new satellite {{by the name of}} Haddock) but Tintin is able to rescue him.|$|E

5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from <b>Earth</b> <b>that</b> its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on <b>Earth.</b> <b>That</b> might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
50|$|Early {{ideas about}} {{the figure of the}} Earth held the Earth to be flat (see flat Earth), and the heavens a {{physical}} dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical <b>Earth</b> were <b>that</b> lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical <b>Earth,</b> and <b>that</b> Polaris is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.|$|R
