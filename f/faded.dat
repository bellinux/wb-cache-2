Depending on the mobility {{and on the}} scattering properties of the environment, different kinds of <b>fading</b> distributions can occur: Ricean <b>fading</b> between static nodes, but also Rayleigh or even double-Rayleigh <b>fading</b> between mobile nodes. We investigate fast <b>fading</b> in indoor peer-to-peer networks based on radio channel measurements. It {{turns out that the}} <b>fading</b> statistics change over time. While the predominant <b>fading</b> mechanism is a combination of Rayleigh and double-Rayleigh <b>fading,</b> Ricean <b>fading</b> also occasionally occurs. On top of that, indoors, the statistics of the fast <b>fading</b> change over time even for small-motions of the nodes, since the propagation environment is inhomogeneous. We comprehensively model these effects using a hidden Markov model, parameterized from our measurements. The model is validated, revealing a convincing fit between the model and the measurements.
