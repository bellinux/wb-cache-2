2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following thought experiment: (<b>i)</b> <b>Assume</b> <b>that</b> a tower of height h (Fig.5‑3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass m {{from the top of the}} tower. It falls freely with acceleration g, reaching the ground with velocity , so that its total energy E, as measured by an observer on the ground, is [...] (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon E back into a particle of rest mass m.|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

60|$|Every {{night that}} we spent in Tibet, we enjoyed a {{magnificent}} display of sunbeams converging to the east, {{and making a}} false sunset.

As the sun set, broad purple beams rose from a dark, low, leaden bank on the eastern horizon, and spreading up to the zenith, covered the intervening space: they lasted through the twilight, from fifteen to twenty minutes, fading gradually into the blackness of night. I looked in vain for the beautiful lancet beam of the zodiacal light; its position was obscured by Chomiomo.|$|E

Harriet had a new china doll and Frank a horn and china dog, and all the corners of our stockings were stuffed with nuts and candies.

6000|$|... 139. The enervating {{influence}} of luxury, and its tendencies to increase vice, are points which I keep {{entirely out of}} consideration in the present essay; but, so far as they bear on any question discussed, they merely furnish additional evidence on the side which I have taken. Thus, in the present case, <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the luxuries of civilized life are in possession harmless, and in acquirement serviceable as a motive for exertion; and even on those favourable terms, we arrive at {{the conclusion that the}} nation ought not to indulge in them except under severe limitations. Much less ought it to indulge in them if the temptation consequent on their possession, or fatality incident to their manufacture, more than counter-balances the good done by the effort to obtain them.|$|E
6000|$|... 19. Secondly. The wood, {{represented}} by these four lines, {{is to be}} always remembered as consisting of fibres and vessels; therefore it is called 'vascular,' a word which {{you may as well}} remember (though rarely needed in familiar English), with its roots, vas, a vase, and vasculum, a little vase or phial. 'Vascule' may sometimes be allowed in botanical descriptions where 'cell' is not clear enough; thus, at present, we find our botanists calling the pith 'cellular' but the wood 'vascular,' with, I think, the implied meaning that a 'vascule,' little or large, is a long thing, and has some liquid in it, while a 'cell' is a more or less round thing, and to be supposed empty, unless described as full. But what liquid fills the vascules of the wood, they do not tell us.[44] <b>I</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> they absorb water, as long as the tree lives.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} more idyllic than our daily routine that summer. Our diversions, {{dependent}} on a love of odorous fields, colorful hills and fruitful vines, were of arcadian content.
