50|$|SkyFuel has two commercially {{available}} products - a parabolic trough {{concentrating solar collector}} (the SkyTrough) and a high reflectance silverized polymer film (ReflecTech). The SkyTrough is the first utility scale solar concentrator to use polymer reflectors rather than glass mirrors.
