2500|$|Fabricator Brian Bulmer {{teamed up}} with {{two-stroke}} <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Brian Wolley and rider Barrie Scully to develop a racing version of the Birmingham Scott air-cooled 350cc twin, setting a record for the Barbon Hill Climb and achieving [...] in a Motor Cycling test. [...] The team also developed a 52bhp water-cooled 500cc version, but competition from Japanese two-strokes meant that the project was not fully developed.|$|E
50|$|Fritz W. Egli, (born June 30, 1937 in Zurich) is a Swiss former {{motorcycle}} racer. He {{is known}} as a motorcycle frame specialist, and <b>engine</b> <b>tuner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{programs}} were principally run by Bill Blydenstein, an <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> and racing driver, and concentrated initially on racing, with the focus changing to rallying from 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{hydraulic}} lifters {{can create}} [...] "valve bounce" [...] at high RPM which is undesirable for performance uses. This is why <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> prefer solid lifters instead.|$|R
50|$|CCS events usually see {{multiple}} track-side vendors, including tires {{from the}} major race-tire manufacturers' brands, performance parts vendors, technical service providers (suspension experts, <b>engine</b> <b>tuners,</b> equipment maintenance, etc.), track-side photographers, and concessions.|$|R
50|$|The Trionic 5.2 and 5.5 systems {{utilized}} the {{manifold absolute pressure}} MAP sensor and the intake air charge temperature sensor to calculate the fuel injection curves, while the Trionic 7 and 8 systems are mass air flow type. The two have substantial differences that prevent utilization of components between the two. Generally speaking, <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> prefer the easier to work with Trionic 5 systems over the Trionic 7 and 8 which are more restrictive in what can be manipulated in the software.|$|R
5000|$|Koenig's regular {{collaborators}} included <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> [...] and , who specialised in widebody kits. Its other outside collaborators included H&R (suspension) {{and later}} in the 1980s, OZ (wheels).|$|E
50|$|He rode in the United Kingdom for the Swindon Robins, Arena Essex Hammers {{and also}} for the Belle Vue Aces. After {{retiring}} he became a notable <b>engine</b> <b>tuner.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Friedl Münch {{began his}} career as a {{mechanic}} and <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> in the late 1940s, working especially with Horex motorcycles. The Horex factory noted the success of his home-tuned racers, and offered Münch a job in their competition department.|$|E
50|$|Koki Saga {{finished}} fourth, {{taking his}} first two victories in Formula Three at the final meeting at Autopolis, while Alexandre Imperatori finished fifth. The only other race-winner was Hideki Yamauchi, who took six podium finishes - including a win at Sugo - in his eight starts. Suzuki's first win at Okayama also gave TOM'S the teams title and the <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> championship, having amassed a maximum score up to round 14. ThreeBond Racing finished runners-up in the teams' championship, while Hanashima Racing's Toyota engines {{finished second in the}} tuners' championship.|$|R
5000|$|No {{intrinsic}} performance gain to be derived, per se, {{lake pipes}} evolved {{a function of}} practicality. Common instances, their manifolds routed straight out the front wheel-whels posing an asphyxiation axiom to the race driver, [...] "lake pipes" [...] were fashioned, extending from the header flange along the rocker panels, bottom-side of the vehicle, beneath the doors, thus allowing (1) suspension tuners a lower ride height sufficient for land speed record attempts, and (2) <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> ease and flexibility of interchanging different exhaust manifolds without hoisting the vehicle, thus precluding having to wrench undercarriage of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The B204 and B234 are {{regarded}} by <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> as the preferable engine for performance tuning over the later B205 and B235 engines as the internals {{are of a}} higher strength. The later models had lightened internal components to improve efficiency and fuel economy but limit the total power output when the engine's software is revised to increase the boost pressures and specific power output. The B204 engine became a very popular engine swap for Vauxhall and Opel Astra, Calibra, Cavalier and Vectras with the GM T-body platform, in Scandinavia in the mid 2000s - the engine uses the same mounting positions due to sharing the same platform.|$|R
50|$|Renault Sport Technologies {{announced}} its return to F3 as an engine supplier with Oreca again as <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> for the 2014 FIA European Formula Three Championship. However, this was indefinitely halted {{because of the}} lack of power of the Oreca-tuned engine compared to rivals.|$|E
50|$|Until Jason's final Speedway Grand Prix {{season in}} 2012, Crumpy was the {{senior member of}} his son's support team, and is a highly {{regarded}} <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> like his father in law (and long time Team Manager of the Australian Speedway Team), the late Neil Street (1931-2011).|$|E
50|$|The SEATCZC {{became the}} Asian Touring Car Series in 2000 as the series changed to use Super Production regulations. WK Longman Racing joined the series with their duo of Peugeot 306 race cars, {{to be driven}} by Henry Lee Jr and C. Nattavude, with support from <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Richard Longman in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Turbochargers {{have also}} been of great benefit to recent petrol engines in the Volkswagen Group. [...] Probably their most famous and widely used engine is their highly popular Audi-developed [...] {{inline-four}} engine. [...] This {{has been used in}} many of their mainstream, and high-performance cars; such as the original Audi S3 and Audi TT, the Mk4 VW Golf GTI, the original Škoda Octavia vRS, and the original SEAT León Cupra R. [...] This strong, and highly tuneable engine has won many prestigious awards, and is highly regarded by professional <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> and motorsports teams. [...] Furthermore, this same engine is used in a very high state of tune in the one-make Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) open-wheeled racing series.|$|R
5000|$|The car used an {{enlarged}} {{version of the}} side valve engine fitted to the Ford Model Y that was increased to a capacity of 1172 cc by increasing the bore from 56.6 mm to 63.5 mm but keeping the stroke at 92.5 mm. A standard engine would produce [...] at 4000 rpm. This engine became a favourite for many <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> in post war days and gave a start to several sports car makers including Lotus Cars and remained in production until 1962. Suspension was by the Ford system of transverse leaf springs with rigid axles front and rear, a system little changed since the Model T. A three speed gearbox was fitted.|$|R
50|$|German tuner Novitec {{created a}} special edition of the Fiat Seicento, adding a {{turbocharger}} and six-speed gearbox to the little car. The German tuner is able to extract 101 hp (74 kW) from the 1,108 cc FIRE <b>engine.</b> Other <b>tuners</b> include the venerable Giannini company, who produced an aggressive bodykit and also considered installing a 1.6 litre engine.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that F3 is still an open formula for which any chassis builder or <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> can supply a product {{provided}} that it meets the technical regulations, most championships have just one de facto choice of chassis supplier - usually Dallara - {{and two or three}} popular engine suppliers - usually Mugen-Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Spiess-Opel, or TOM's-Toyota.|$|E
50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> David Vizard rated this {{carburettor}} highly in {{his book}} Tuning the A Series Engine and also in recent on-line comments pertaining to the high fuelling atomisation characteristics of this carburettor suiting the siamese port layout of BMC A-Series engines. Similarly, the author Clive Trickey rated these carburettors well {{in his book}} More Mini Tuning.|$|E
50|$|An expert racing <b>engine</b> <b>tuner,</b> le Vack {{worked for}} some of the great marques and in the late 1920s joined Motosacoche in Switzerland as the works rider, chief {{designer}} and tuner. Bert le Vack was killed in a sidecar accident the 17 September 1931 near Bern, but is generally regarded as being one of the greatest racing motorcyclists of his day.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{difference}} in engine output and modification potential between the American and JDM models, the second-generation Si sparked a popular trend of <b>engine</b> swapping, where <b>tuners</b> would replace the D-series power plant with a more powerful B-series motor.|$|R
5000|$|A {{matter of}} some debate is the [...] "indexing" [...] of plugs upon installation, usually only for {{high-performance}} or racing applications; this involves installing {{them so that}} the open area of the spark gap, not shrouded by the ground electrode, faces {{the center of the}} combustion chamber, towards the intake valve, rather than the wall. Some <b>engine</b> <b>tuners</b> believe that this will maximize the exposure of the fuel-air mixture to the spark, also ensuring that every combustion chamber is even in layout and therefore resulting in better ignition; however, others believe this is useful only to keep the ground electrode {{out of the way of}} the piston in ultra-high-compression engines if clearance is insufficient. In any event, this is accomplished by marking the location of the gap on the outside of the plug, installing it, and noting the direction in which the mark faces; then the plug is removed, and additional washers are added to change the orientation of the tightened plug. This must be done individually for each plug, as the orientation of the gap with respect to the threads of the shell is random. Some plugs are made with a non-random orientation of the gap and are usually marked as such by a suffix to the model number; typically these are specified by manufacturers of very small engines where the spark plug tip and electrodes form a significantly large part of the shape of the combustion chamber. The Honda Insight has indexed spark plugs from factory, with four different part numbers available corresponding to the different degrees of indexing to achieve most efficient combustion and maximal fuel efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|However, that {{an engine}} [...] "pulls hard" [...] {{all the way}} to its redline and running the engine to the redline before {{shifting}} does not automatically guarantee maximum performance and efficiency. Tachometer redlines generally indicate the maximum safe operating speed of the engine, rather than their peak efficiency and power production speed. Engine and chassis dynamometer testing nearly always reveals decreasing returns in torque and horsepower as an engine nears its redline, as volumetric efficiency and parasitic loads result in diminishing returns relative to fuel and air consumed. <b>Engine</b> builders and <b>tuners</b> strive for maximum area [...] "under the curve", referring to the horsepower curve resulting from engine testing. Horsepower is the rate at which an engine is performing work rather than a measurement of an engine's actual power output at a given time, which is actually indicated by torque, or the twisting force available at the crankshaft. Torque is what performs the actual work, and high torque output over a large [...] "power band" [...] indicates better engine [...] "balance" [...] and tuning.|$|R
50|$|Derrington-Francis Racing Team was a {{short-lived}} Formula One team from Britain. It {{was founded by}} Stirling Moss' former chief mechanic, Alf Francis, and <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Vic Derrington, acquiring an old Automobili Turismo e Sport Tipo 100 car after the ATS operation had closed in 1963. The car, named the Derrington-Francis ATS after the team's founders, featured a spaceframe chassis, a short wheelbase and square-shaped aluminium body panels.|$|E
50|$|Fabricator Brian Bulmer {{teamed up}} with {{two-stroke}} <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Brian Wolley and rider Barrie Scully to develop a racing version of the Birmingham Scott air-cooled 350 cc twin, setting a record for the Barbon Hill Climb and achieving 115.4 mph in a Motor Cycling test. The team also developed a 52 bhp water-cooled 500 cc version, but competition from Japanese two-strokes meant that the project was not fully developed.|$|E
50|$|During 2015, SMR {{acted as}} a Yamaha factory {{development}} agent in conjunction with Yamaha Europe and their German research and development base, using the British Superbike season to progress the machines in advance of an anticipated return to World Superbike racing in 2016. The alliance provided {{the team with the}} latest engine improvements, with manager Mick Shanley making regular trips to the base of <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Marcus Eschenbacher.|$|E
50|$|As BMW {{announced}} {{its intention to}} officially withdraw {{at the end of}} , Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver brokered a deal with support from its primary sponsor, USF&G, to continue the use of the upright 4cyl BMW engines under the name of USF&G subsidiary Megatron, Inc., founded by long-time F1 aficionado John J. Schmidt. The engines were serviced by the team's long time <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Heini Mader from Switzerland, the former mechanic of Jo Siffert.|$|E
50|$|A {{specialist}} <b>engine</b> <b>tuner,</b> Joe Ehrlich made unique two-stroke motorcycles. EMC stopped {{mass production}} in 1952 but Ehrlich used {{his knowledge of}} German technology to re-engineer the DKW Rennsporte Ladempumpe production racers, which he developed as one-off EMC racing bikes and won several events over the next 25 years. The EMC 125 cc racer was considered among the fastest of its size in the early 1960s. Ehrlich left in 1967 and the company was wound up in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Born in Shere, Surrey, UK, Mortimer {{is the son}} of Charles Mortimer Senior, {{a former}} {{motorcycle}} road racer and proprietor of the Charles Mortimer Race School based at Brands Hatch race circuit, Kent. The school was originally named in 1963 as the Beart-Mortimer racing school, with <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Francis Beart being a partner to Mortimer Senior which ended in 1965 due to Beart's other business involvements. From 1966 the venues included Cadwell Park, Silverstone and Mallory Park.|$|E
50|$|In 1975 the Toyota Motor Corporation officially {{recognized}} TOM'S as {{an authorized}} tuning shop. In 1978, the firm opened a garage in the Tama area of Tokyo. The tuning firm expanded to Norfolk, England with branch openings in 1987. TOM'S entered the Japanese Formula 3 as an <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> in 1981. In 1987 the company open a British factory to produce Formula 3 engines for Europe. They also were F3 chassis manufacturers from 1991 to 1997.|$|E
50|$|British racer Les Archer, Jr. {{worked with}} frame {{specialist}} Ron Hankins and <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Ray Petty {{to develop a}} Norton Manx for motocross competition. The double-overhead-cam, short-stroke Norton Manx road racing engine was fitted into a Hankins frame and finished with an aluminium tank and titanium axles. His earlier Manx MX was successful, winning the 1956 F.I.M. 500 cc European Motocross Championship, but even the later updated 1962 machine {{was not able to}} compete with the emerging two-stroke bikes of the middle 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{cars that}} Gordini {{sent to the}} race track in Le Mans were very fast. Gordini’s <b>engine</b> <b>tuner,</b> also called the “sorcerer”, breathed Grand Prix {{performance}} into regular engines - a feat no one believed possible. The Musée National de l'Automobile de Mulhouse in Mulhouse, France featuring the Schlumpf Collection has in its collection Grand Prix and road racing cars of the Gordini brand. Exhibits include a type 16 Grand Prix from 1954, a single seater type 32 from 1956 and the Gordini 26 S, the car driven by the famous French author Françoise Sagan.|$|E
50|$|The {{programmable}} ECU may {{control the}} amount of fuel to be injected into each cylinder. This varies depending on the engine's RPM and {{the position of the}} accelerator pedal (or the manifold air pressure). The <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> can adjust this by bringing up a spreadsheet-like page on the laptop where each cell represents an intersection between a specific RPM value and an accelerator pedal position (or the throttle position, as it is called). In this cell a number corresponding to {{the amount of}} fuel to be injected is entered. This spreadsheet {{is often referred to as}} a fuel table or fuel map.|$|E
50|$|In February 2011, Reed was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes, and doctors stated he {{would be unable to}} race again. As a result, Reed became a diabetes advocate, and established the foundation Ryan's Mission. Reed installed a drink system in his car, along with a blood glucose monitor on the car's dashboard which displays data from a wireless device attached to Reed's stomach. During races, Reed would monitor his blood glucose levels, while Roush <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> Craig Herrmann would inject Reed with insulin during pit stops. Reed is one of three drivers in a national racing series with type 1 diabetes, along with IndyCar Series drivers Charlie Kimball and Conor Daly.|$|E
5000|$|Mugen Motorsports (M-TEC Co., Ltd) (無限) is a Japanese company {{formed in}} 1973 by Hirotoshi Honda, {{the son of}} Honda Motor Company founder Soichiro Honda, and Masao Kimura. Mugen, meaning [...] "Without Limit", [...] "Unlimited" [...] or [...] "Vast", (hence the {{commonly}} placed word [...] "Power" [...] after, denoting [...] "Unlimited Power") is an <b>engine</b> <b>tuner</b> and parts manufacturer that manufactures OEM parts such as body kits and sports exhausts for Honda Motor Company. Despite the family connections, however, Mugen is not, and has never been, owned by Honda Motor Company; Mugen owner Hirotoshi Honda has been the major shareholder in Honda since his father's death in 1991.|$|E
