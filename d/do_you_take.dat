500|$|DuVall joined Alice in Chains as {{lead singer}} during the band's reunion concerts. Duff McKagan again joined the band for the reunion tour, playing rhythm guitar on {{selected}} songs. Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E
500|$|Dudley {{also managed}} several wrestlers, {{including}} Bobo Brazil. Prior to Brazil's matches, Dudley excited the crowds by waving a towel while {{running to the}} ring. Over time, Dudley's role with the company diminished and he ceased working for them; the company's operations were moved to Connecticut, and Turner's Arena was demolished. Shortly before McMahon's death in 1984, he told his son, Vincent K. McMahon, who had taken {{over control of the}} promotion (then known as the WWF), [...] "Whatever else you <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> care of James Dudley." [...] After Vincent J. McMahon's death, Dudley was put back on the company payroll at age 74 and subsequently received several gifts from Vincent K. McMahon to show appreciation for Dudley's contributions to the company. Dudley has been described as an [...] "important cog" [...] in the company, and McMahon once stated that [...] "had there been no James Dudley, the WWF possibly wouldn't exist as it does today". Dudley continued to feel a sense of loyalty to the McMahons and their promotion. Dudley was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994 by Vincent K. McMahon.|$|E
2500|$|While Paris {{still wanted}} to resist, most of France wanted {{an end to the}} war as soon as possible. Thiers was a {{candidate}} in the elections, and won in twenty-six different departments, with a [...] total of two million votes. He chose to represent a seat in Paris. The majority of the two hundred newly elected deputies favored a constitutional monarchy, though it is also included a substantial group of republicans, including Victor Hugo. At the first session, Jules Grévy, a republican sympathetic to Thiers, was elected president of the assembly, with 519 votes of the 536 voting. On 14 February the Assembly voted to pass the powers of the Government of National Defense to the new Assembly. On 17 February, on a proposition by Grévy, Thiers was elected the Chef du pouvoir executive, or Chief Executive of the government. He asked the Assembly that the words [...] "Of the French Republic" [...] be added to his title. [...] "i have great admiration for cooks," [...] he told the Assembly. [...] "They call them Chefs. You have named me the Chef of the Executive Power. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me for a cook? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> France for a kitchen?" [...] The deputies laughed and agreed to the addition. The new government was promptly recognized by Britain, Italy, Austria, and Russia. For the first time since 1852, France was once again officially a republic.|$|E

2500|$|Above all else, Asquith {{thrived on}} company and conversation. A clubbable man, he enjoyed [...] "the {{companionship}} of clever and attractive women" [...] even more. Throughout his life, Asquith had {{a circle of}} close female friends, which Margot termed his [...] "harem". In 1912, one of these, Venetia Stanley became much closer. Meeting first in 1909–1910, by 1912 she was Asquith's constant correspondent and companion. Between that point and 1915, he wrote her some 560 letters, {{at a rate of}} up to four a day. Although it remains uncertain {{whether or not they were}} lovers, she became of central importance to him. Asquith's thorough enjoyment of [...] "comfort and luxury" [...] during peacetime, and his unwillingness to adjust his behaviour during conflict, ultimately contributed to the impression of a man out of touch. Lady Tree's teasing question, asked at the height of the conflict; [...] "Tell me, Mr Asquith, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> an interest in the war;" [...] conveyed a commonly held view.|$|E
2500|$|Then Vishnu, the omniscient {{director}} of the cosmic game, staged a small comedy. He transformed Nandi (the bull of Shiva) into a dancing bull and conducted {{him in front of}} Gajasura, assuming, at the same time, the appearance of a flutist. The enchanting performance of the bull sent the demon into ecstasies, and he asked the flutist to tell him what he desired. The musical Vishnu responded: [...] "Can you give me that which I ask?" [...] Gajasura replied: [...] "Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me for? I can immediately give you whatever you ask." [...] The flutist then said: [...] "If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach." [...] Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, {{the only one who could}} have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet. Having agreed to liberate Shiva, Gajasura asks him for two last gifts: [...] "I have been blessed by you with many gifts; my last requests are that everyone should remember me adoring my head and you should wear my skin." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Cantrell, bassist Mike Inez, {{and drummer}} Sean Kinney reunited {{to perform a}} benefit concert in Seattle for victims of the tsunami {{disaster}} that struck South Asia. On March 10, 2006, the surviving members performed at VH1's Decades Rock Live concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart. The band followed the concert with a short United States club tour, several festival dates in Europe, and a brief tour in Japan. Comes with the Fall vocalist DuVall joined Alice in Chains as lead singer during the band's reunion concerts. Cantrell stated, [...] "We want to celebrate what we did {{and the memory of}} our friend.

6000|$|... "About your debts, Kilcullen: why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> conceal from {{me their}} full amount? Why, at any rate, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> pains {{to make me}} think them so much less than they really are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Edward {{smiled and}} {{answered}} frankly, [...] "Nay, don't mind me. You thought I was the heir, perhaps. Whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> my brother for last night?" ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was much}} {{surprised}} by this explanation, {{and a good deal}} relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; but instead of replying, I said, [...] "If it be as you state, then why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me from my island, and why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not now <b>take</b> me back?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well,' I asked, {{though every}} hair upon my head stood erect with horror (adding {{greatly to the}} {{peculiarity}} of my appearance), 'well, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> It what It asked for?' ...|$|R

40|$|I {{argued that}} certain phrases that I called “non-listed {{generalized}} lexical integers ” could only contain indefinite NPs. In his comments Jim Huang {{noted that this}} claim squared well with Hornstein and Weinberg’s (1981) observations concerning preposition stranding. However, he also pointed out a problem posed by the following paradigm: (1) a. Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a picture of? b. *Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the/every picture of? c. Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the best picture of? The problem is that (lc) is a misfit. Superlatives are presumably definite; nevertheless, (lc) is grammatical {{on a par with}} (la), as opposed to (lb). The answer I started sketching on the spot was as follows. Consider what (lc) really means. By mechanically applying the standard rules of interpretation one would predict that (lc) is used in the following situation: (2) A person, unknown to us, has various pictures, one of which is the best. <b>You</b> <b>took</b> this picture. We want to know who this person is. But a moment of reflection shows that (1 c) does not mean this. Rather, it means something like the following...|$|R
