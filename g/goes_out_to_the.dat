The song 'XO' was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and {{to remind us that}} unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Sandor Clegane, {{otherwise}} known as the Hound, is revealed to have survived his wounds, and is now living among {{a small band of}} villagers. Their leader, a warrior turned septon named Ray, talks with Sandor, and recounts how he found Sandor on the verge of death and nursed him back to health. However, Sandor still feels guilt over his past sins, feeling he has not been punished for them. At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the villagers, but upon finding out that they have no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns Ray that the Brotherhood will return, but Ray refuses to prepare for a confrontation with them. After Sandor <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forest to gather some wood, he returns to find the villagers slaughtered and Ray hanged. Enraged, Sandor picks up an axe and marches off.|$|E
25|$|Once {{approved}} by Congress, the joint resolution proposing {{a constitutional amendment}} does not require Presidential approval before it <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states. While Article I Section 7 provides that all federal legislation must, before becoming Law, {{be presented to the}} President for his or her signature or veto, Article V provides no such requirement for constitutional amendments {{approved by}} Congress, or by a federal convention. Thus the president has no official function in the process. In Hollingsworth v. Virginia (1798), the Supreme Court affirmed that {{it is not necessary to}} place constitutional amendments before the President for approval or veto.|$|E

25|$|A year later, Rudolph <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{reindeer}} games {{where all}} the other new fawns will be inspected by Santa and learn to pull his sleigh. During flight practice, Rudolph becomes acquainted with a beautiful doe named Clarice who tells him he's cute, which causes Rudolph to fly. However, while engaging in celebratory play with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the others {{to make fun of}} him. Rudolph is then told he can no longer play in the reindeer games. Walking away, Rudolph meets up with Hermey, an elf who ran away from Santa's workshop because {{he wanted to be a}} dentist instead of making toys, and they decide to run away together. The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius, who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster of the North on an iceberg, the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer. The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys. However, Rudolph awakens in the night and leaves the island on his own due to his concern that his nose, which attracts the Abominable, will endanger his friends.|$|E

2500|$|Abitol the barber, citing Rav, {{said that}} the Pharaoh whom Moses {{addressed}} was a puny fellow, a cubit tall, with a beard {{as long as he}} was tall, embodying the words in [...] that [...] "the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and [...] [...] [...] sets up over it the lowest of men." [...] And Abitol the barber, citing Rav, deduced from the words [...] "Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water" [...] in [...] that this Pharaoh was a magus who went to the water to perform sorcery.|$|E

Therefore, Pharaoh used to go early in the morning to the water (when no one else was there to witness that he {{relieved}} himself like other humans). God, therefore, told Moses to catch him just at this critical moment.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Japan Today had {{reported}} that, by 2010, Japan {{would become a}} signatory of the convention. [...] However, this report later proved to be inaccurate. [...] The 2009 election saw the Democratic Party of Japan gain power. Yukio Hatoyama stated in an interview, My heart <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fathers and mothers. There are cases of mothers as well. We support ratifying and enforcing the Hague Convention, and involved in this is a sweeping change to allow divorced fathers visitation of their children. That issue affects not just foreign national fathers, but Japanese fathers as well. I believe in this change.|$|E

2500|$|Carl D. Atkins insinuates {{that the}} final quatrain of Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 is the final stage in which youth disappears forever. [...] "As the fire goes out when the wood which has been feeding it is consumed, so is life {{extinguished}} when the strength of youth is past". He compares the burning fire that slowly <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> passing away of life, as old age prevails youth. Shakespeare {{is concerned with the}} reality of death, [...] "the fading out of life's energy". He realizes that what he has [...] "nourished" [...] but must now [...] "expire". [...] "The ashes of his youth doth lie" [...] â€“the ashes of his youth burn brightly, as he recognizes that what brightened up his youth is devoured by the fire burning away his old age. As a result, Shakespeare informs his audience that we must [...] "love more strongly", because in the end, we are going to leave it all behind and respond to death.|$|E
