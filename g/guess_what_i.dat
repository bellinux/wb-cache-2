500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but <b>guess</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> don't take care of myself.|$|E
500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but <b>guess</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do {{if my mother}} had been {{anything}} but what she was, as from <b>guessing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do if I had a talent for music.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{answered}} my message," [...] he said, seizing it. [...] "You must have <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant when I asked if I might come across." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you would}} have looked at them more curiously yet, {{if you could have}} <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have to tell you,' said her friend. 'One of those houses is mine.' ...|$|R
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Biz Markie {{appeared}} in a RadioShack commercial, repeating the line: [...] "Oh Snap! <b>Guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw!" [...] from his song [...] "Just A Friend". That same year saw his debut with Andy Milonakis in television commercials for the commercial Internet service Tune Up.|$|E
2500|$|Poruchik Rzhevsky and Natasha Rostova {{are riding}} horses {{together}} on the countryside. [...] "Poruchik, what a beautiful meadow! <b>Guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see there?" [...] / [...] "Arse, mademoiselle?" [...] / [...] "Ouch, Poruchik! I see chamomiles!" [...] (Chamomiles are Russian cliché folk flowers) / [...] "How romantic, mademoiselle! An arse amid chamomiles!..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Haven’t you <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{was driven}} to do!” cried the woman. Distracted by the {{vividness}} of her dreadful apprehensions, her head ringing with forceful words, that kept the horror of her position before her mind, she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself. She had no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed phrases completed only in her thought. She had felt the relief of a full confession, and she gave a special meaning to every sentence spoken by Comrade Ossipon, whose knowledge did {{not in the least}} resemble her own. “Haven’t you <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{was driven to}} do!” Her voice fell. “You needn’t be long in <b>guessing</b> then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am afraid of,” she continued, in a bitter and sombre murmur. “I won’t have it. I won’t. I won’t. I won’t. You must promise to kill me first!” She shook the lapels of his coat. “It must never be!” ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should answer, I believe, for I {{was sure}} that Eustace would fail without Harold, and I {{told him that his}} cousin must not be left to himself till he had a good wife. To which Harold replied, [...] "Are all English ladies like that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've done <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could. I {{had another}} try this morning, but he caught me {{looking for it}} and <b>I</b> believe he <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was after, because he was unusually short with me. It's my opinion that he has taken to wearing the thing; so far as I can discover, it's nowhere in the house. One hesitates about ransacking his room." ...|$|R
2500|$|A Microsoft expert {{was quoted}} as saying at a 2005 {{security}} conference: [...] "I claim that password policy should say you should write down your password. I have 68 different passwords. If I am not allowed to write any of them down, <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to do? I am going to use the same password on every one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rzhevsky narrates {{his latest}} {{adventure}} to his Hussar comrades. [...] "...So I am riding through this dark wood and suddenly see a wide, white..." [...] / Hussars, all together: [...] "...arse!" [...] / [...] "Of course not! A glade full of chamomiles! And {{right in the}} middle there is a beautiful white..." [...] / Hussars, encore: [...] "...arse!" [...] / [...] "How vulgar of you! A mansion! So I open the door and <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see?" [...] / Hussars, encore: [...] "An arse!" [...] / Poruchik, genuinely surprised: [...] "How did you guess? Did I tell this story before?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 2, 2009, {{the day of}} Pacquiao's {{fight against}} Ricky Hatton, Mayweather {{announced}} that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, The Ring lightweight champion and number 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Marquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a twelve-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a twelve-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: [...] "If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause <b>guess</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round.... When you talk boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather." ...|$|E
60|$|Harold bit {{the hair}} that hung over his lip, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} {{found to be}} the truth, that his stepfather was no small trial to him; being, in fact, an unprosperous tutor and hanger-on on some nobleman's family, finally sent out by his patrons in despair, to keep school in Sydney.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he must {{celebrate}} his worship down below {{for a little}} while. The old fool pretends to know everything, but he never <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going to do. Besides, we don't want him breaking in upon our privacy, do we? He might see the gold when we find it, and rob us of it afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess,</b> with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{can earn}} for father, I can pull through the year, I must get back. I'm awfully obliged to you, Jim." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Mr Wegg,' said Venus, {{smiling in}} a sprightly manner, 'I suspect {{you could hardly}} <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to do}} next.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly for Somewhere; but I don't {{yet know}} Where. You would never <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am {{travelling}} from. Shall I tell you? I am travelling from my birthday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And to you,' said Guy, {{looking at}} his uncle, {{as if it was}} {{especially}} pleasant to be obliged to him. 'You never can <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> owe to you!' ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{with the}} pleasantest manner in the world, I stepped aside, and plucked the cane from the Chevalier's hand {{before he had}} so much as <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was about. I bowed before him with the utmost politeness, as if craving his leave and {{tolerance}} for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was about to do, and then, before he had recovered from his astonishment, I had laid that cane three times in quick succession across his shoulders. With a cry at once of pain and of mortification, he sprang back, and his hand dropped to his hilt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Behrens! No! He's {{going through}} the {{breaches}} I made. He's <b>guessing</b> out <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant to do. And he's getting it set out all wrong,--misleading terminology,--distinctions made in the wrong place. Oh, the fool he is!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{reader will}} <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> followed. <b>I</b> fell deeply {{in love with}} Clara Maitland, to whom I confided the secret of my birth. The generous girl {{asserted}} that she had detected the superiority of my manner at once. We plighted our troth, and resolved to wait upon events.|$|R
60|$|Can you <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} doing lately? Washing out my conscience, effacing the blot on my escutcheon, {{performing}} an expiation, translating over again from the Greek the 'Prometheus' of Aeschylus.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is sweet," [...] she said. She asked curiously: [...] "What {{did you do}} last night, {{after you}} left me? I can't guess, though I daresay you can <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tire of you! Good heavens! Now you'll never <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{was doing}} while the parson {{was telling us}} about what Saint Paul said to the Colossians, {{and all the rest}} of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Presently she came, {{escorted by}} the Swazi who was grinning, for <b>I</b> think he <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{expected}} to see. I stared and rubbed my eyes, thinking that I {{must still be}} asleep, for instead of a fat old Isanusi there appeared a tall and graceful young woman, rather light-coloured, with deep and quiet eyes and a by no means ill-favoured face, remarkable for a fixed and somewhat mysterious smile. She was a witch-doctoress sure enough, for she wore in her hair the regulation bladders and about her neck the circlet of baboon's teeth, also round her middle a girdle from which hung little bags of medicines.|$|R
60|$|I remembered {{directly}} Old File's {{story of}} Mrs. Dulcifer's elopement, {{and of the}} jewels she had taken with her. It was easy to <b>guess,</b> after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had heard, that the poor woman had secretly preserved some of her little property {{for the benefit of}} her child.|$|R
6000|$|... "They would {{once have}} been. Yes, they would now," [...] said Margaret. [...] "And government, and management, and influence--you would not <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> dreams <b>I</b> used to waste on them, {{and now here}} am I set aside from it all, good for nothing but for all you dear ones to be kind to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I {{say to the}} Devil?" [...] She {{still held}} him by the hand, and now she laughed lightly as she looked into his face. [...] "Cannot you <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was {{thinking}}," [...] says he. [...] "I was thinking I {{would be a}} happier man if I could ride and run the danger {{of my life with}} these lawless companions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} not this, reverend sir," [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "nor do I <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can have now said or done, {{to draw down}} on me an admonition which has something a taste of reproof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are the best, always. If, then, I am plain with you, {{will you}} be plain with me also? I think you must <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> it is <b>I</b> {{have to say to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God {{that you}} are back again, Gervaise!" [...] he said, as he grasped the hand of his friend. [...] "I did not return {{until late in the}} evening, having been at work with a large body of slaves at the fortifications; and you may <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> joy <b>I</b> felt at the news. You are changed a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘But what is it, father?’ said Meg. ‘Come. You haven’t <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> it is. And {{you must}} <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> it is. <b>I</b> can’t think of taking it out, till you <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> it is. Don’t be {{in such a}} hurry! Wait a minute! A {{little bit more of}} the cover. Now guess!’ ...|$|R
