Traditional methods using passive noise control is only practicable for high frequencies. As a complement to passive noise control, active noise control (ANC) {{can be used to}} reduce low frequency noise. The main idea of ANC is to use destructive interference of waves to cancel <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement an ANC system in the driver's cabin of a Valmet 890 forest machine. The engine boom {{is one of the most}} <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises</b> and therefore the main subjective for the ANC system to suppress. The ANC system is implemented on a Texas Instrument DSP development starter kit. Different FxLMS algorithms are evaluated with feedback and feedforward configurations. The results indicate that an ANC system significantly reduces the sound pressure level (SPL) in the cabin. Best performance of the evaluated systems is achieved for the feedforward FxLMS system. For a commonly used engine speed of 1500 rpm, the SPL is reduced with 17 dB. The results show fast enough convergence and global suppression of low frequency noise...|$|E

METHODS: We tested the cognitive performances and emotional reactions of 120 childless participants on a working memory task while being subjected to different <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises</b> including infant crying. RESULTS: Participants had the least correct trials on the working memory task, and showed the most negative emotions, when hearing infant crying {{as compared to the}} other noises. Participants also showed less positive emotions when hearing infant crying as compared to working in silence. Overall, negative emotions were associated with less correct trials on the working memory task, except in the infant crying condition. Furthermore, cognitive performance and emotional reactions to infant crying were unrelated to personality characteristics. CONCLUSION: Negative emotions and cognitive disturbances may be general adult responses to infant crying that are not limited to parents. These results suggest a broadly present human emotional and cognitive response to infant crying, that may underlie a general predisposition to care for infants in distress...|$|E

The algorithm we have developed this time is to segment the plane surfaces and point clouds and to extract the line of two intersecting planes, as the break-line. But since our algorithm is not yet completely free from the errors in calculating of algorithm and measuring of TLS, it is used as yet primarily for pre-processing steps, such as creation of a plan or a modeling or assisting to understand object form or making rough sketch of an object.

This study analyses the nationwide results of the seleXys TPS cup and the Bionit 2 liner (Mathys, Bettlach, Switzerland) with respect to implant survival, cause for revision and mortality rates compared to other CoC articulations using the same stem. MethodsUtilising the New Zealand Joint Registry, we compared the seleXys TPS cup with Bionit 2 liner used with an uncemented Twinsys femoral stem to every other uncemented CoC THR using the same stem. Multivariate {{analysis was used to}} determine the effects of patient age, gender, ASA score and implant head size on these rates. ResultsBetween 2006 and 2013 a total of 1035 seleXys THRs were performed on 862 patients. The comparison group had 375 THRs on 280 patients. There were 77 revisions (1. 4 / 100 component years) in the study group and two in the comparison group (0. 12 / 100 component years). Overall hazards ratio for revision was 12. 22 times higher and female gender was associated with an increased risk (hazards ratio 1. 77).

40|$|Background: In {{the schools}} {{today it is}} common that {{teachers}} talk about {{children with special needs}} and children with “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder” – ADHD. You can often hear people discuss about children with ADHD from the teachers point of view, that pupils are hard to handle and that they {{do not know how to}} create a good relationship with them. But you seldom hear anyone talk about school from the children’s perspective, how they feel, think and experience their school attendance.   Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine how a functional disability like ADHD can effect a childs schooling and also to show how pupils with ADHD themselves experience their school attendance and how they are being treated by teachers and other pupils. Method: In order to investigate this, five interviews was carried out with students in the the ages of 16 - 25. I was interested in their experiences from their years in compulsory school, first to ninth grade. The theoretical basis in this study has been Vygotskijs socio-cultural perspective and concepts such as self-esteem and individualization. Result: The result of the interviews shows that large classes and <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises</b> in the classroom affected the pupil’s concentration in a bad way. They felt that their teachers did not listen or understood their complex of problems, which resulted in frustration, disappointment and anger, which often led to conflicts. They also felt that the teachers very often criticized and punished them, which resulted in more frustration and decreased self-esteem. All respondents felt a kind of alienation because of the treatment from teachers and other children. Conclusions: One of the conclusions in this study is that the teachers did not have enough knowledge, understanding or competence to give the pupils the support they required, and therefore, this study emphasizes the importance of further education for teachers...|$|E

Labaere@uz. kuleuven. ac. be Objectives: The {{objective of this}} study was to make a qualitative comparison between tracheo-esophageal speech with manual stoma occlusion and hands free tracheo-esophageal speech with the Provox FreeHands device. Patients/Materials and Methods: Both Manual and handsfree tracheo-esophageal speech were compared in 13 patients who were regular users of Provox Freehands for at least four months. Evaluation of speech material consisted of objective analysis using the KayPentax CSL, perceptual ratings by a group of experienced listeners and patients own perceptual judgment. In addition, data concerning user-friendliness, additional values and inconveniences of the FreeHands device were gathered using questionnaires. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was used to evaluate the relation between voice related QOL and method of stoma occlusion. Therefore a control group of TE-speakers who did not use hands free speech, was selected. Results: Objective analysis revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) for parameters fluency (i. e. the number of syllables produced on one intake of breath) and maximal phonation time, to the detriment of hands free speech. There were no significant differences found for the dynamic characteristics Perceptual judgements of running speech were rated higher in the manual occlusion condition for most patients, but there were interrater differences. Subjective impressions showed that the majority of patients preferred hands free speech to manual stoma occlusion, noticably for voice quality, fatigability, attractivity and feelings of self-confidence. Major inconveniences of hands free speech were a significantly decreased duration of sticker adhesion, the occurrence of <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises</b> and the need for continued effort. The VHI scores were significantly higher in the group of hands free speakers compared to the control group. Conclusions: This clinical study showed that in selected patients the Provox FreeHands shows important subjective benefits.

40|$|The {{quality and}} {{intelligibility}} of speech conversation are generally degraded by the surrounding noises. The main objective of speech enhancement (SE) {{is to eliminate}} or reduce such <b>disturbing</b> <b>noises</b> from the degraded speech. Various SE methods have been proposed in literature. Among them, the Kalman filter (KF) {{is known to be}} an efficient SE method that uses the minimum mean square error (MMSE). However, most of the conventional KF based speech enhancement methods need access to clean speech and additive noise information for the state-space model parameters, namely, the linear prediction coefficients (LPCs) and the additive noise variance estimation, which is impractical in the sense that in practice, we can access only the noisy speech. Moreover, it is quite difficult to estimate these model parameters efficiently in the presence of adverse environmental noises. Therefore, the main focus of this thesis is to develop single channel speech enhancement algorithms using Kalman filter, where the model parameters are estimated in noisy conditions. Depending on these parameter estimation techniques, the proposed SE methods are classified into three approaches based on non-iterative, iterative, and sub-band iterative KF. In the first approach, a non-iterative Kalman filter based speech enhancement algorithm is presented, which operates on a frame-by-frame basis. In this proposed method, the state-space model parameters, namely, the LPCs and noise variance, are estimated first in noisy conditions. For LPC estimation, a combined speech smoothing and autocorrelation method is employed. A new method based on a lower-order truncated Taylor series approximation of the noisy speech along with a difference operation serving as high-pass filtering is introduced for the noise variance estimation. The non-iterative Kalman filter is then implemented with these estimated parameters effectively. In order to enhance the SE performance as well as parameter estimation accuracy in noisy conditions, an iterative Kalman filter based single channel SE method is proposed as the second approach, which also operates on a frame-by-frame basis. For each frame, the state-space model parameters of the KF are estimated through an iterative procedure. The Kalman filtering iteration is first applied to each noisy speech frame, reducing the noise component to a certain degree. At the end of this first iteration, the LPCs and other state-space model parameters are re-estimated using the processed speech frame and the Kalman filtering is repeated for the same processed frame. This iteration continues till the KF converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached, giving further enhanced speech frame. The same procedure will repeat for the following frames until the last noisy speech frame being processed. For further improving the speech enhancement performance, a sub-band iterative Kalman filter based SE method is also proposed as the third approach. A wavelet filter-bank is first used to decompose the noisy speech into a number of sub-bands. To achieve the best trade-off among the noise reduction, speech intelligibility and computational complexity, a partial reconstruction scheme based on consecutive mean squared error (CMSE) is proposed to synthesize the low-frequency (LF) and highfrequency (HF) sub-bands such that the iterative KF is employed only to the partially reconstructed HF sub-band speech. Finally, the enhanced HF sub-band speech is combined with the partially reconstructed LF sub-band speech to reconstruct the full-band enhanced speech. Experimental results have shown that the proposed KF based SE methods are capable of reducing adverse environmental noises {{for a wide range of}} input SNRs, and the overall performance of the proposed methods in terms of different evaluation metrics is superior to some existing state-of-the art SE methods...|$|E
