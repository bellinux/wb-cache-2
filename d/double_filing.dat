50|$|The initial {{start of}} the race may {{organize}} the cars in specific lines. For instance, NASCAR races start <b>double</b> <b>file,</b> and the Indy 500 starts triple file. Restarts, however, are often only single file, but lapped cars may form a second line on the inside. Some short track ovals have a rule, adopted by NASCAR in June 2009, and INDYCAR in 2011, where the restarts are all <b>double</b> <b>file,</b> with the leader's choice of inside or outside on the ensuing restart.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009: Tony Stewart {{became the}} first owner-driver to win since Ricky Rudd at Martinsville in 1998. It {{was also the first}} race in NASCAR's history to {{introduce}} <b>double</b> <b>file</b> restarts.|$|R

60|$|Now {{the word}} was given that we rejoin the main body quietly, and in <b>double</b> <b>file,</b> with no man straying from the ranks; but Sergeant Corney and I led Jacob between us, for the lad was well-nigh frantic with grief because no {{satisfaction}} concerning {{his father had been}} obtained from Thayendanega.|$|R

50|$|The cavalry of the Achaean League was {{supposedly}} inefficient. Philopoemen, {{in the late}} 3rd century, having already reformed the foot soldiers into a Macedonian-style phalanx, also reformed the cavalry. The Achaean cavalry was organised into lochoi, files of eight men, who were then grouped into dilochiai, <b>double</b> <b>files</b> of 16, then grouped into oulamoi of 32, ilai of 64, hipparchiai of 128 and syntagmata of 256.|$|R
60|$|The road led {{through a}} forest of great gum-trees, lean and scraggy and sorrowful. The road was cream-white--a clayey kind of earth, apparently. Along it toiled {{occasional}} freight wagons, drawn by long <b>double</b> <b>files</b> of oxen. Those wagons were going a journey of two hundred miles, I was told, and were running a successful opposition to the railway! The railways are owned and run by the government.|$|R
60|$|A {{feeling of}} intense relief and {{satisfaction}} followed. Father Esteban {{pulled out his}} snuff-box {{and took a long}} and complacent pinch. But his relief was quickly changed to consternation as an armed cavalcade rapidly wheeled out of the plaza and cantered towards him, with the unmistakable spectacle of the male passengers of the Excelsior riding two and two, and guarded by <b>double</b> <b>files</b> of dragoons on each side.|$|R
60|$|This {{proclamation}} {{having been}} made, the heralds withdrew to their stations. The knights, entering {{at either end}} of the lists in long procession, arranged themselves in a <b>double</b> <b>file,</b> precisely opposite to each other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the foremost rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully marshalled the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his place.|$|R
50|$|A tetrarchia was {{a unit of}} four {{files and}} a tetrarchès or tetrarch was a {{commander}} of four files; a dilochia was a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> and a dilochitès was a double-file leader; a lochos was a single file and a lochagos was a file leader; a dimoiria was a half file and a dimoirites was a half-file leader. Another name for the half file was a hèmilochion with a hèmilochitès being a half-file leader.|$|R
5000|$|On the lap 65 restart, Kurt Busch got loose {{underneath}} Larson in Turn 1, overcorrected, {{turned up}} the track and slammed into Brad Keselowski, sending him into the wall, bringing out the fourth caution. Keselowski called the incident [...] "one of them racing deals" [...] and the field just [...] "lined up <b>double</b> <b>file</b> and somebody got loose and just took us out. What a bummer. Just one of them racing deals." ...|$|R

He reined in on a knoll and peered. There were slender gleams of steel here and there in that cloud, and it contained moving forms which revealed themselves at last as a long line of peasant carts full of soldiers, moving slowly in <b>double</b> <b>file</b> under the escort of mounted Cossacks.|$|R
2500|$|In all NASCAR series, if the {{caution is}} out for debris, accident, or inclement weather, the flagman will display the yellow caution flag and the pace car [...] will {{pull out of the}} pits and turn on the yellow strobes on top and/or behind the car. [...] When race {{officials}} are ready to open pit lane, a green light will come on in the rear window of the safety car. One lap before a green flag, the pace car will shut off its lights to signal drivers to line up <b>double</b> <b>file.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Supercars used a 'knockout' style {{qualifying}} race {{in order}} to set the grid {{for the rest of}} the weekend. This involved the bottom three cars being forced to retire on each of laps three to eight until only the top 10 remained, who completed the race. 2014 introduced both <b>double</b> <b>file</b> rolling starts to each race as well as awarding double points for the final race of the weekend, a move designed to imitate Formula One's plans for a double points race in their own season finale in Abu Dhabi.|$|R

50|$|As of 2017, {{the event}} {{features}} four races either thirteen laps or approximately thirty minutes of length. Practice and qualifying are held on Thursday, two races are held on Friday, {{and then one}} each on Saturday and Sunday. 2017 saw the removal of a progressive grid across the event, with four ten-minute qualifying sessions to be held on Thursday to dictate the grid for the four races. As since 2014, each race features a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> rolling start. The points from each race are accumulated to find an event winner, however the points do not count towards that year's championship.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the area}} {{developed}} into a rural Anglo community, some of the modern paved roads followed the original Native-American pathways. One famous immigration route passed through Round Rock and is called the [...] "Double File Trail" [...] because the path was wide enough for two horsemen to ride side-by-side. It {{is part of a}} longer trail from north Texas that crossed the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, Brushy Creek in Round Rock, and the Colorado River in Austin. An elementary school in the Round Rock school district is named for the trail, <b>Double</b> <b>File</b> Trail Elementary School.|$|R
60|$|The Swiss band led {{the line}} of march. After it pranced the local comandante, mounted, and a {{detachment}} of his troops. Next came a carriage with {{four members of the}} cabinet, conspicuous among them the Minister of War, old General Pilar, with his white moustache and his soldierly bearing. Then the president's vehicle, containing also the Ministers of Finance and State; and surrounded by Captain Cruz's light horse formed in a close <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of fours. Following them, the rest of the officials of state, the judges and distinguished military and social ornaments of public and private life.|$|R
6000|$|None {{of these}} {{symptoms}} of alarm and trepidation struck Butler, whose mind was occupied with a different, and to him still more interesting subject, until {{he stood before}} {{the entrance to the}} prison, and saw it defended by a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of grenadiers, instead of bolts and bars. Their [...] "Stand, stand!" [...] the blackened appearance of the doorless gateway, and the winding staircase and apartments of the Tolbooth, now open to the public eye, recalled the whole proceedings of the eventful night.

50|$|The Budweiser Shootout {{was held}} February 8 at Daytona International Speedway. It was won by No. 8 of Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. The race {{featured}} drivers {{who have won}} a pole in the previous season or have won the event before. 2003 marked changes to the race's format, {{for the first time}} the race ran at night. The 70-lap event was now split into two segments. After the first 20-lap segment a 10-minute intermission took place allowing drivers to make pit stops and repair their cars. The second segment featured a 50-lap race to the finish with cars restarting <b>double</b> <b>file</b> on all restarts. Drivers were also required to make at least one pit stop under the green flag.|$|R
60|$|A little awed by {{the manner}} of the Commander, Hurlstone bowed and {{followed}} him across the courtyard. It was filled with soldiers, and near the gateway a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of dragoons, with loaded carbines, were standing at ease. Two sentries were ranged on each side of an open door which gave upon the courtyard. The Commander paused before it, and with a gesture invited him to enter. It was a large square apartment, lighted only by the open door and a grated enclosure above it. Seated in his shirtsleeves, before a rude table, Senor Perkins was quietly writing. The shadow of Hurlstone's figure falling across his paper caused him to look up.|$|R
60|$|I had a cattle-stall in {{the main}} stable--a cavern fitted up with a long <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of two-storied bunks, the files {{separated}} by a calico partition--twenty men and boys {{on one side of}} it, twenty women and girls on the other. The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company, and smelt like a kennel. When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and began to pitch and wallow, the cavern prisoners became immediately seasick, and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previous experiences of the kind well away in the shade. And the wails, the groans, the cries, the shrieks, the strange ejaculations--it was wonderful.|$|R

He has required that I shall be banished to England; and as his order is backed by a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of red-coats,--an instrument which in Britannula we do not possess,--I purpose to obey him. I shall go to England, and I shall there use what little strength remains {{to me in my}} endeavour to put forward those arguments for conquering the prejudices of the people which have prevailed here, but which I am very sure would have no effect upon Sir Ferdinando Brown.|$|R

50|$|Until 1858, {{different}} modes of execution were in use: shooting, hanging, breaking on the wheel, „lethal gauntlet“ (a <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of men {{facing each other}} and armed with birch rods with which to strike at {{a person who is}} made to run between them) and decapitation; in the very beginning, there were a few instances of impalement. Until 1842, murderers were subject to „mirror“ punishments, meaning that a murderer was to be killed in an identical manner in which he killed the victim (often with the same weapon). In addition, the bodies of executed offenders were almost always publicly displayed on wheels and kept there for a set period of time or until „complete decay“. In 1858, shooting became the only legal mode of execution, while the practice of displaying the bodies was discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|In 1878, local parishioners renovated {{the keep}} into a chapel, {{installing}} {{a shrine to}} the Virgin Mary. In the same year, the English writer Robert Louis Stevenson passed through on his travel-adventure, as he recorded in Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes: ... hill came to {{a point in the}} ruins of the castle of Luc, which pricked up impudently from below my feet, carrying on a pinnacle a tall white statue of Our Lady, which, I heard with interest, weighed fifty quintals, and was to be dedicated on the 6th of October ... Luc itself was a straggling <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of houses wedged between hill and river. It had no beauty, nor was there any notable feature, save the old castle overhead with its fifty quintals of brand-new Madonna.|$|R
25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of {{the leader of the}} race will be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field. These cars are not {{permitted}} to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up <b>double</b> <b>file</b> for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars > Cars 1 or more laps down > Free Pass Car > Wave Arounds > Cars who have received a penalty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{but think}} that Sir Ferdinando gave himself {{unnecessary}} trouble in endeavouring {{to prove to}} us that the Fixed Period is a wicked arrangement. He was not likely to succeed in that attempt. But he was sure to succeed in telling us that he would make it impossible by means of the <b>double</b> <b>file</b> of armed men by whom he is accompanied, and the 250-ton steam-swiveller with which, as he informed me, he is able to blow us all into atoms, unless I would be ready to start with Captain Battleax to-morrow. It is not his religion but his strength that has prevailed. That Great Britain is much stronger than Britannula none of us can doubt. Till yesterday I did doubt whether she would use her strength to perpetuate her own prejudices and to put down the progress made by another people.|$|R
