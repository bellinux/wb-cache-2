40|$|Metallurgical coke samples {{across the}} tuyere level of an {{operating}} blast furnace were analysed using a fractographic approach {{to identify and}} quantify various coke failure mechanisms. Tuyere level cokes displayed different failure mechanisms compared to the <b>feed</b> <b>coke,</b> implying a strong influence of the blast furnace reaction environment on the modification of coke failure mechanisms. The conchoidal and brittle overload type failures were noted {{to have an effect}} on the propagation of transgranular and intergranular crack growth in the coke microstructure. <b>Feed</b> <b>coke</b> breakage behaviour was strongly influenced by existing fissures and conchoidal fracture, while the breakage of the deadman coke lumps was dominated by pore wall collapse through intergranular crack growth in combination with erosive wear. The porosity at the IMDC–RMDC interface in coke has been identified as a critical parameter contributing to coke failure at tuyere regions. This fractographic study demonstrates that the fracture faces show evidence of the varying failure mechanisms presented in the preceding manuscripts (Part 1 and Part 2), in addition to the erosive wear resulting from the blast furnace exposure. However, further studies are required to establish the association between the identified coke failure mechanisms and coke texture, which has implications for improving coke performance in a blast furnace...|$|E
30|$|Significant {{variations}} in the qualities of products occur when resids are proportionally incorporated into the conventional VGO feedstock. The FCC catalysts are easier to deactivate along with higher delta coke formation and metal deposition, leading to reduced conversion of feedstock. Generally, four types of coke form in the FCC process: catalytic coke formed during the cracking reactions; contaminant coke from the activity of contaminant metals such as Ni and V; <b>feed</b> <b>coke</b> from the con-carbon in the feed; cat-to-oil coke from “unstripped” hydrocarbons that carry over into the regenerator. The severe deactivation from coke formation and metal contamination after resid incorporation is unavoidable, as a result dry gas yields including hydrogen and slurry oil yield increase while gasoline selectivity decreases.|$|E

The hydrogen-deficient species can be further transformed into aromatics and coke via further dehydrogenation and cyclization reactions. Hydrogen transfer reactions are prevalent at high conversions and help to decrease the selectivity to olefins as shown in Fig.  8.|$|R

Additionally, {{it has been}} shown that the LAS played a key role in reducing the sulfur content of FCC gasoline following the similar ways as previously reported; however, the addition of excess Mg had a better effect on sulfur reduction particularly on aliphatic sulfur species due to the synergistic effect of basic sites and LAS on additives.|$|E

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{developing}} a fuel processor for converting liquid hydrocarbon fuels to a hydrogen-rich product suitable for a polymer electrolyte fuel cell stack. The processor uses an autothermal reformer to convert the feed to a mixture of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water with trace quantities of other components. The carbon monoxide in the product gas is then converted to carbon dioxide in water-gas shift and preferential oxidation reactors. Fuels that have been tested include standard and low-sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels. Iso-octane and n-hexadecane were also examined as surrogates for gasoline and diesel, respectively. Complete conversion of gasoline was achieved at 750 C in a microreactor over a novel catalyst developed at Argonne. Diesel fuel was completely converted at 850 C over this same catalyst. Product streams contained greater than 60 % hydrogen on a dry, nitrogen-free basis with iso-octane, gasoline, and n-hexadecane.

40|$|The Rotary Combustor {{is a novel}} {{concept for}} burning coal with low SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} emissions. It burns crushed coal in a fluid bed where the bed is {{maintained}} in a rotating drum by centripetal force. Since this force may be varied, the combustor may be very compact, and thus be a direct replacement for a p. c. burner on existing boilers. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate that a typical industrial boiler can be refired with the modified prototype Rotary Combustor to burn Ohio high-sulfur coal with low emissions of SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x}. The primary problem that must be resolved to demonstrate sustained operations with coal is temperature control in the rotating fluid bed. The prototype Rotary Combustor was assembled and installed on the T- 850 P CNB boiler at the CONSOL Energy site in South Park, Pennsylvania. Several design improvements were investigated and implemented during the assembly to improve the prototype Rotary Combustor operations compared to prior tests at Detroit Stoker in Monroe, Michigan. An Operating Manual and Safety Review were completed. The shakedown test phase was initiated. Two major problems were initially encountered: binding of the rotating drum at operating temperatures, and reduced fluid-bed pressure drop after short periods of operation. Plating the brush seal rotary land ring with a chrome carbide plasma spray and lubricating the seal prior to each test sufficiently resolved these problems to permit {{a limited number of}} operations tests. Unlike previous tests at Detroit Stoker, sustained operation of the prototype Rotary Combustor was accomplished burning a high-Btu fuel, metallurgical coke. The prototype Rotary Combustor was operated with coke in gasifier mode on two occasions. Fluid-bed temperature spiking was minimized with manual control of the <b>feeds</b> (<b>coke,</b> air and steam), and no clinker formation problems were encountered in either test. Emission levels of NO{sub x} were measured at about 270 ppmv which were higher those targeted for the device which were 100 ppmv. This was assumed to be because of the aforementioned temperature spiking. The primary operating problem remains control of the fluid-bed temperature. Although improvements were made, steam flow control was manual, and very coarse. To accomplish this will require finer control of the steam flow to the rotary drum air plenum, and development of an algorithm for automatic control using the Moore APACS{trademark}. This is the recommended succeeding step {{in the development of the}} Rotary Combustor for industrial or utility use...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{conversion}} of propane to propylene and ethylene over a V 2 O 5 /CeO 2 /SA 5205 (V:Ce= 1 : 1) catalyst, {{with or without}} steam and limited O 2, has been studied at different temperatures (700 - 850 Â Â°C), C 3 H 8 /O 2 ratio (4. 0), H 2 O/C 3 H 8 ratio (0. 5) and space velocity (3000 cm 3 g- 1 h- 1). The propane conversion, selectivity for propylene and net heat of reaction ([Delta]Hr) are strongly influenced by the reaction temperature and presence of steam in the reactant feed. In the presence of steam and limited O 2, the process involves a coupling of endothermic thermal cracking and exothermic oxidative conversion reactions of propane which occur simultaneously. Because of the coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions, the process operates in an energy-efficient and safe manner. The net heat of reaction can be controlled by the reaction temperature and concentration of O 2. The process exothermicity {{is found to be}} reduced drastically with increasing temperature.

A high benzene yield was obtained and the stability of the catalyst was improved by adding 1. 5 %DME to the CH 4 feed. The C 6 H 6 yield was as high as ca. 10 % even after reaction for 6 h. The stability of the catalyst was further improved when DME concentration in the co-feed gas was increased to an appropriate value. TGA and TPO results of the used 6 Mo/HZSM- 5 catalyst showed that the amount of coke on the used catalyst was reduced and the chemical nature of the coke was changed. When 1. 5 %DME was added to the CH 4 <b>feed,</b> the <b>coke</b> formed on the catalyst could be burned off more easily than that when only CH 4 was used as reactant.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The size distribution and strength of metallurgical coke are factors vital for the steady and high-efficiency operation of a blast furnace, since these factors govern stack penneability. Coke strength influences the size of lump coke {{not only because of}} size degradation by impact and abrasion during transfer to and descent in the blast furnace, but also because of its influence on the fracture which takes place in the coke layer during carbonisation and the effect this has on the initial mean size and size distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coke.</b> Therefore, the elucidation of the relationship between coke strength and the fissure fonnation phenomena is significant. In this study, therefore, the coke strength development during carbonisation has been examined in conjunction with various parameters, such as the degree of carbonisation of the coal, namely the extent or fraction of pyrolytic reaction, and the degree of graphitisation of the coke, as well as carbonisation temperature and heating regime. The porous structure of coke has also been examined with a view to establishing a relation between the porous structure and the coking properties of the coal carbonised. The quality of coke porous structure was evaluated by parameters introduced in this study, i. e., the pore size distribution and pore rugosity factors. A poor porous structure is shown to be associated with high proportion of small pores and pores with a rough surface. These features are considered to stem from poor coking properties and the consequent poor adhesion between coal particles. An attempt has also been made to establish a mathematical model capable of predicting the degree of fissuring of coke during carbonisation by utilising the understandings obtained in this study of the coke strength development during carbonisation and the effect of coal properties on coke strength. Coke samples large enough to facilitate the observation of the degree of fissuring in relation to various coal properties and heating conditions, were made to evaluate the mathematical model and introduce the concept. The concept that fissuring takes place when developing thennal stress exceeds the developing coke strength is demonstrated to be capable to evaluate the effects of coal properties and heating conditions on the degree of fissuring observed...|$|E

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) {{is one of the}} most important processes in the petroleum refining industry for the conversion of heavy gasoil to gasoline and diesel. Furthermore, valuable gases such as ethylene, propylene and isobutylene are produced. The performance of the FCC units plays a major role on the overall economics of refinery plants. Any improvement in operation or control of FCC units will result in dramatic economic benefits. Present studies are concerned with the general behaviour of the industrial FCC plant, and have dealt with the modelling of the FCC units, which are very useful in elucidating the main characteristics of these systems for better design, operation, and control. Traditional control theory is no longer suitable for the increasingly sophisticated operating conditions and product specifications of the FCC unit. Due to the large economic benefits, these trends make the process control more challenging. There is now strong demand for advanced control strategies with higher quality to meet the challenges imposed by the growing technological and market competition. According to these highlights, the thesis objectives were to develop a new mathematical model for the FCC process, which was used to study the dynamic behaviour of the process and to demonstrate the benefits of the advanced control (particularly Model Predictive Control based on the nonlinear process model) for the FCC unit. The model describes the seven main sections of the entire FCC unit: (1) the feed and preheating system, (2) reactor, (3) regenerator, (4) air blower, (5) wet gas compressor, (6) catalyst circulation lines and (7) main fractionators. The novelty of the developed model consists in that besides the complex dynamics of the reactorregenerator system, it includes the dynamic model of the fractionator, as well as a new five lump kinetic model for the riser, which incorporates the temperature effect on the reaction kinetics; hence, it is able to predict the final production rate of the main products (gasoline and diesel), and can be used to analyze the effect of changing process conditions on the product distribution. The FCC unit model has been developed incorporating the temperature effect on reactor kinetics reference construction and operation data from an industrial unit. The resulting global model of the FCC unit is described by a complex system of partial-differential-equations, which was solved by discretising the kinetic models in the riser and regenerator on a fixed grid along the height of the units, using finite differences. The resulting model is a high order DAE, with 942 ODEs (142 from material and energy balances and 800 resulting from the discretisation of the kinetic models). The model offers the possibility of investigating the way that advanced control strategies can be implemented, while also ensuring that the operation of the unit is environmentally safe. All the investigated disturbances showed considerable influence on the products composition. Taking into account the very high volume production of an industrial FCC unit, these disturbances can have a significant economic impact. The fresh <b>feed</b> <b>coke</b> formation factor {{is one of the most}} important disturbances analysed. It shows significant effect on the process variables. The objective regarding the control of the unit has to consider not only to improve productivity by increasing the reaction temperature, but also to assure that the operation of the unit is environmentally safe, by keeping the concentration of CO in the stack gas below a certain limit. The model was used to investigate different control input-output pairing using classical controllability analysis based on relative gain array (RGA). Several multi-loop control schemes were first investigated by implementing advanced PID control using anti-windup.

The primary product would be a high quality fuel gas, which {{could also be used}} as a source of hydrogen. The concept involves subjecting the hydrocarbon feed to pyrolysis and steam gasification in a circulating bed of solids. Carbon residue formed during pyrolysis, as well as metals in the feed, are captured by the circulating solids which are returned {{to the bottom of the}} transport reactor. Air or oxygen is introduced in this lower zone and sufficient carbon is burned, sub-stoichiometrically, to provide the necessary heat for the endothermic pyrolysis and gasification reactions. The hot solids and gases leaving this zone pass upward to contact the feed material and continue the gasification process.

40|$|Char, {{the major}} {{co-product}} of mild coal gasification, represents about 70 {{percent of the}} total product yield. The only viable use for the char is in the production of formed coke. Early work to develop formed coke used char from a pilot plant sized mild gasification unit (MGU), which was based on commercial units of the COALITE plant in England. Formed coke was made at a bench-scale production level using MGU chars from different coals. An evolutionary formed coke development process over a two-year period resulted in formed coke production at bench-scale levels that met metallurgical industries` specifications. In an ASTM D 5341 reactivity test by a certified lab, the coke tested CRI 30. 4 and CSR 67. 0 which is excellent. The standard is CRI 55. In 1991, a continuous 1000 pounds per hour coal feed mild coal gasification pilot plant (CMGU) was completed. The gasification unit is a heated unique screw conveyor designed to continuously process plastic coal, vent volatiles generated by pyrolysis of coal, and convert the plastic coal to free flowing char. The screw reactor auxiliary components are basic solids materials handling equipment. The screw reactor will convert coal to char and volatile co-products at a rate greater than 1000 pounds per hour of coal <b>feed.</b> Formed <b>coke</b> from CMGU char is comparable to that from the MGU char. In pilot-plant test runs, up to 20 tons of foundry coke were produced. Three formed coke tests at commercial foundries were successful.

The last 20 -ton test was 100 percent CTC/DOE coke. With conventional coke in this cupola charging rates were 10 charges per hour. The formed coke charges were 11 to 12 charges per hour.

40|$|The main {{achievements}} {{in the present}} studies are summarized as 4 key points: 1) HZSM- 5 supported Mo and Re catalysts {{are found to be}} quite active and selective for directly conyerting methane to benzene, naphthalene and C 2 hydrocarbons. A great progress for methane aromatization has been made because of the discover of the two new catalysts. 2) Coke deposition on the catalyst for non-oxidative conversion of methane is solved by varying methane pressure combined with addition of CO 2 in methane <b>feed.</b> <b>Coke</b> selectivity is about 0 at 3 atm methane and with 1 - 3 % CO 2 addition in methane feed. 3) Two reactions on Re/HZSM- 5 catalyst are identifried: i) methane with CO at the nearly same consumption rate to produce benzene, naphthalene and C 2 hydrocarbonss; ii) an improved reforming reaction of methane with CO 2 to produce aromatics and synthesis gas. 4) MoO 3 /HZSM- 5 and Re 207 /HZSM- 5 are first endothermically converted to its reduced state before production of benzene. Mo exists in its carbide and is highly dispersed on the HZSM- 5 support. The results are presented in details in 9 chapters. It was found in chapter 2 that Mo modified ZSM- 5 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity to benzene for the conversion of methane at 973 K under nonoxidizing conditions. H 2 and ethene may be the primary products in the conversion of methane to benzene. It was found in chapter 3 that the catalytic activity and stability of Mo/HZSM- 5 can be enhanced by the addition of Zr or W and it is also very sensitive to pretreatment conditions. Pretreatment of catalysts under air atmosphere at a high temperature lead to an increase in pore size of the catalysts and a decrease in methane conversion and activity maintenance. However, the catalysts can be stabilized under the atmosphere of methane. A new Mo phase is formed under the methane atmosphere, which is a perquisite of the formation of arom atics and C 2 hydrocarbons. In chapter 4, the TG/DTA/MS, XANES/EXAFS and SEM/TEM studies reveal that HZSM- 5 supported Mo oxide is endothermally converted with methane around 955 K to molybdenum carbide (Mo 2 C) cluster (Mo-C, C. N. = 1, R＝ 2. 09 A; Mo-Mo, C. N. ＝ 2. 3 - 3. 5; R＝ 2. 98 A). The formed Mo carbide exists on HZSM- 5 support in the uniform particles. The highly dispersed metal carbide on HZSM- 5 support acts as the active center to activate methane primarily to C 2 hydrocarbons, which are secondarily dehydrocondensed towards benzene and naphthalene on HZSM- 5 support. Methane aromatization with addition of C 2 hydrocarbons such as ethane and ethene and acetylene on Mo/HZSM- 5 catalyst is studied in chapter 5. Addition of all C 2 hydrocarbons in methane feed lead to an increase of benzene formation rate and ethane addition is most effect to enhance the rate of benzene formation. A much high formation rate and selectivity of benzene is achieved by addition of about 4. 3 % ethane in methane feed. The formation rate and selectivity of naphthalene is most effectively enhanced by addition of 4. 3 % acetylene. The increase of benzene formation rate is due to high concentration of [C 2 Hy] intermediates for benzene formation by addition of C 2. Addition of acetylene lead to enhancement of the secondary reaction of benzene to produce naphthalene, so the formation rate and selectivity of naphthalene is high. In chapter 6, catalytic dehydroaromatization of methane with CO and/or CO 2 toward benzene and naphthalene on Mo/HZSM- 5 and Fe/Co modified Mo/HZSM- 5 in the prolonged time of 100 h is studied. The catalyst stability is enhanced and coke formation is suppressed by adding CO and/or CO 2 to the methane feed and by varying methane pressure. Bifunctional catalysis of Mo/HZSM- 5 is discussed by the mechanism that methane is activated on Mo sites to form CHx and C 2 -species, and then secondarily to form benzene and naphthalene. Dependence of activity and selectivity for methane aromatization on Mo/HZSM- 5 on the reaction conditions such as pressure and specifric velocity of methane, CO 2 addition at high SV and reaction temperature is investigated in chapter 7. A high and stable benzene formation rate of about 1700 nmole/s/g-cat is achieved for methane aromatization on Mo/HZSM- 5 by increasing methane pressure from 1 to 3 atm, methane specifric velocity from 1440 to 10000 ml/h/g-cat and reaction temperature from 973 to 1073 K, and by adding about 2. 1 % CO 2 to methane feed. The rate of benzene formatioh with time on stream is remarkably stabilized by varying methane pressure and addition of 2. 1 % CO 2 in methane feed and greatly enhanced by increasing methane specific velocity from 1440 to 10000 ml/h/g-cat and reaction temperature from 973 to 1073 K. The selectivity of benzene and naphthalene and coke is also controlled by varying reaction conditions. High methane specific velocity lead to high benzene selectivity and low naphthalene selectivity. Catalytic features of Re/HZSM- 5 -based catalyst for aromatization reaction of methane are studied and compared with that of Mo/HZSM- 5 in chapter 8. It is found in TPR of Re 2 O 7 /HZSM- 5 in methane flow that methane activation process is initiated by reduction of Re 2 O 7 /HZSM- 5, which is endothermic and company with production of hydrocarbon oxides and loss of catalyst weight. However, the reduction of catalyst in hydrogen stream is a exothermic process and takes place at a much lower temperature. We propose that rhenium carbide is formed by reductien of Re 2 O 7 /HZSM- 5 in methane flow. The carbide is stable in the atmosphere of methane and catalyze the reaction of methane aromatization. The temperature for formation of rhenium carbide is about 100 K lower than that for formation of molybdenum carbide and Re/HZSM- 5 shows much better low-temperature activity than Mo/HZSM- 5 -based catalyst. To compare with Mo/HZSM- 5 -based catalyst, Re/HZSM- 5 -based catalyst exhibits a better lower-temperature activity and a higher selectivity to C 2 hydrocarbons. Catalytic conversion of methane with CO to aromatics on Re/HZSM- 5 -based catalyst are studied in chapter 9. The CO involves in the catalytic conversion with methane to produce aromatics and the catalytic activity for benzene formation, therefore, is greatly enhanced by adding CO to methane feed. Futhermore, the conversion of CO with methane also lead to formation of some intermediate products such as CO 2 and H 20, which eliminate coke on the catalyst. Therefore, the coke deposition is decreased and catalyst stability is enhanced by CO addition. Effect of CO 2 addition on aromatization of methane on Re/HZ SM- 5 -based catalyst are studied in chapter 10. High and stable rate of benzene fomation is achieved at a high SV of methane on Re/HZSM- 5 type catalyst by addition of about 1 - 3 % CO 2 to methane feed. A little amount of CO 2 in methane feed is very effective to suppress deposition of coke on the catalyst and to enhance selectivity of hydrocarbon products. Seleetivity for coke deposition is about 0 at the presence of 1 - 3 % CO 2 in methane feed. The reaction of CO 2 with coke to produce CO and the secondary reaction of produced CO with hydrogen to produce CHx species are responsible for the low coke selectivity and high hydrocarbon selectivity...|$|E
40|$|Synthesis and physico-chemical {{characterization}} of a pure AlPO 4 and AlPO 4 modified by introduction of SO 42 - ions (2 wt. -%) or Na+ ions (0. 5 wt. -%) {{have been carried}} out. The influence of these ions on AlPO 4, activity and selectivity in the 1 -butanol dehydration has been investigated. The acid-base properties of these catalysts were determined by ammonia and carbon dioxide TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of absorbed pyridine. Ion incorporation leads to a modification in the AlPO 4 acid-base properties, especially on the acid sites strength, with only very minor modification of its textural properties. Thus, Na+ ions decreased the number of strong acid sites whereas SO 42 - ions increased it. A linear relationship between those acid sites and selectivity values was found. Butenes (1 -butene and 2 -butenes) selectivities increased when the concentration of stronger acid sites was increased while the opposite trend was observed for dibutyl ether selectivity, The resistance to deactivation of the catalysts was examined not only in function of time on-stream in the 1 -butanol dehydration but also after treatment with water or methylcyclopentane in the <b>feed</b> (for generating <b>coke).</b> Both factors negatively affected the AlPO 4 activity and the reaction temperature determined which factor was of prevailing influence. Besides, acid sites strength had {{an important role in}} the AlPO 4 deactivation...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocracking and {{hydrotreating}} are bitumen upgrading technologies {{designed to}} enhance fuel quality by decreasing its density, viscosity, boiling point and heteroatom content via hydrogen addition. The aim of this thesis is to model and simulate an upgrading and integrated gasification combined cycle then to evaluate the feasibility of integrating slurry hydrocracking, trickle-bed hydrotreating and residue gasification using the Aspen HYSYS® simulation software. The close-coupling of the bitumen upgrading facilities with gasification should lead to a hydrogen, steam and power self-sufficient upgrading facility with CO 2 capture. Hydrocracker residue is first withdrawn from a 100, 000 BPD Athabasca bitumen upgrading facility, characterized via ultimate analysis and then fed to a gasification unit where it produces hydrogen that is partially recycled to the hydrocracker and hydrotreaters and partially burned for power production in a high hydrogen combined cycle unit. The integrated design is simulated for a base case of 90 % carbon capture utilizing a monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent, and compared to 65 % and no carbon capture scenarios. The hydrogen production of the gasification process is evaluated in terms of hydrocracker residue and auxiliary petroleum <b>coke</b> <b>feeds.</b> The power production is determined for various carbon capture cases and for an optimal hydrocracking operation. Hence, the feasibility of {{the integration of the}} upgrading process and the IGCC resides in meeting the hydrogen demand of the upgrading facility while producing enough steam and electricity for a power and energy self-sufficient operation, regardless of the extent of carbon capture...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} 10 {{years since the}} JK size-dependent {{breakage}} model was developed (Shi and Kojovic, 2007). This series of papers present 20 applications of {{the model for the}} mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the size reduction as the equipment model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer mill for <b>coke</b> <b>feed</b> preparation, a vertical spindle mill for coal pulverised fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation. The energy-size reduction modelling approach permits the simulations of the effects of changes in ore/coal and machine operating conditions on comminution product size distribution...|$|R
40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a rotary kiln with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the rotary kiln is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the rotary kiln, in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (rotary kiln – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the rotary kiln on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the rotary kiln, in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the rotary kiln. In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric acids, tar acids and high-heat-value waste materials in the rotary kiln. The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the rotary kiln, where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the rotary kiln and thus <b>feed</b> the <b>coke</b> bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the rotary kiln is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the rotary kiln are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the rotary kiln. One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the rotary kiln and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as tar acids can impair the energy balance in the rotary kiln and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising rotary kiln, post-combustion chamber and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{reforming}} is {{an important}} source of synthesis gas production that is used by major petrochemical processes such as ammonia, methanol and the Fisher-Tropsch process. In steam reforming, a hydrocarbon like natural gas reacts with steam over a Ni-based catalyst to mainly produce a synthesis gas mixture (H 2 /CO). Steam reforming development has progressed considerably since its inception in 1925. This process nevertheless continues to face many challenges, for example carbon formation which leads to poor catalyst activity, CO 2 emissions and high operation cost due to the large energy requirement. In industry, a large amount of excess steam (steam: carbon ratio > 3) is employed to maximise carbon removal and this results in high energy cost due to the high steam demand. This project introduces a novel reactor technique for the steam reforming process in order to overcome the above challenges. This novel technique provides a practical solution to control catalyst activity during steam reforming at a low steam to carbon ratio (S:C = 1) through a periodic interruption of carbon deposition which can be achieved via periodic cycling between propane-steam reforming <b>feed</b> and a <b>coke</b> gasifying agent over a Co-Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. In order to identify the optimal gasifying agent to be employed in the reformer-generator fluidised bed reactor, regeneration kinetics of coked steam reforming catalysts were evaluated using five different carbon gasifying agents (pure O 2, air, CO 2, H 2, and N 2). The observed results presented a phenomenological basis for the carbon gasification kinetics and shed light {{on the nature of the}} gasifying agent in effective carbon removal. The performance of the gasifying agent decreased in the order O 2 > air > CO 2 > H 2 > N 2 in terms of intrinsic reactivity and effectiveness of carbon removal. In light of the current global demand for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to minimise overall energy usage, it seems appropriate that CO 2 produced in steam reforming would be used for the catalyst regenerator for better regenerator operation without the risk of catalyst sintering. The performance of propane steam reforming under steady-state and periodic operation was evaluated at different experimental variables and the study confirmed that forced composition cycling has a superior positive effect on propane conversion compared to steady-state operation. Periodic cycling with pure CO 2 also effected a significant reduction in carbon over-layer and hence improved catalyst activity and longevity. Further, the comparison between steady-state and periodic operation demonstrated economical benefits in the operation of an industrial steam reforming plant under periodic operation in terms of reducing the steam reforming cost as well as reducing the effect of emitting CO 2 into the atmosphere. An artificial neural network (ANN) technique was introduced in this study to evaluate the nonlinear dependency of key reaction metrics on periodic parameters of cycling between propane steam reforming and carbon gasification by CO 2. The investigation showed that the cycle split played a more important and positive role than cycle period in both H 2 and CO production...|$|R
40|$|Desulfurization {{of fossil}} fuels with {{supercritical}} water (SCW) has been the topic of many studies {{over the past few}} decades. This process does not require the use of any catalyst, eliminates the need for a hydrogen <b>feed,</b> and minimizes <b>coke</b> formation. Previous research has shown that {{it has the potential to}} be a viable commercial process, and recent experimental studies have proven that water acts as one hydrogen source for sulfur removal in this process. However, the exact desulfurization mechanism is largely unknown, as are many other reaction mechanisms involving sulfur compounds. Recent work has greatly expanded our ability to build comprehensive reaction mechanisms automatically for the decomposition of organic sulfur compounds using the automated Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG). This thesis presents the implementation of this and other tools to investigate chemical processes relevant to our use of fuel sources containing sulfur compounds, and it shows some steps that have been taken to improve our predictions for these mechanisms and those that will be generated in the future. Previous investigations had focused on the pyrolysis of small sulfur compounds containing less than six heavy atoms, so RMG is first used to study the pyrolysis of t-butyl sulfide. A detailed reaction mechanism is then presented for the SCW desulfurization of hexyl sulfide. Comprehensive kinetic mechanisms for these larger molecules are likely to include thousands of reactions, so RMG builds this model in a systematic and unbiased way using a database of ab initio data. This database is expanded with potentially relevant thermochemical and kinetic parameters using transition state theory and quantum chemical calculations at the CBS-QB 3 and CCSD(T) -F 12 levels of theory. With these data, as well as previously calculated rates for hydrocarbon and sulfur kinetics, RMG is used to build a reaction mechanism for the conversion of hexyl sulfide to hydrogen sulfide, pentane, and carbon monoxide in the presence of SCW. This mechanism is validated with results from batch and flow reactor experiments, and predictions are accurate within a factor of two for reactant and major product concentrations. Analysis of the proposed mechanism shows that the molecular addition of water to the carbonsulfur double-bond in hexanethial is a key step in the SCW process, as this not only leads to the desulfurization of the compound, but also prevents the thioaldehyde from undergoing addition reactions with other hydrocarbons in a process that could eventually form coke. Thus, this work not only has implications in the SCW desulfurization process, but in the overall crude oil upgrading process as well. The calculated kinetic and thermochemical parameters are used to generate predictive reaction mechanisms for other processes relevant in fuel chemistry, such as the geological formation of oil and gas from kerogen. This not only allows us to model experimental work investigating the effect sulfur compounds have on the oil-to-gas process, but we also explore how these effects differ at geological conditions and timescales. And as the possible applications of RMG grow, the need for accurate parameters in mechanism generation become even more critical. A thermochemical database is generated for a wide variety of sulfur compounds using the highaccuracy CCSD(T) -F 12 /cc-pVTZ-F 12 method, and this provides a basis for the investigation of organosulfur chemistry with tighter uncertainty. by Caleb Andrew Class.

40|$|Carbon {{required}} for the reduction of alumina by electrolysis in the Hall-Héroult process is supplied by the anode. Anodes are produced from a mixture of petroleum coke with coal tar pitch as the binder. The minimum theoretical carbon consumption is 0. 334 kg C/kg Al. But due to current efficiency and oxidation losses the consumption is typically 400 kg C/kg Al. Petroleum coke is a by-product from crude oil refineries, but as its value represents only about 2 per cent of the overall production it has a limited interest to the producers. Mechanical and physical properties of coke {{are influenced by the}} crude oil, processes within the refineries and calcining of the coke. Continuous high demand for calcined coke by aluminium smelters has created a difficult situation with respect to quality and availability, leading to the use of lower quality coke in aluminium smelters and potential disturbances in the production. Understanding the consequences of varying calcined coke qualities is crucial for to possibly compensate and adjust process parameters in the subsequent use of the coke, in order to obtain economical production of aluminium. In the present work, the subject of study was four different petroleum coke types, where three were derived from a single source (SSA, SSB and SSC) and one was from a blend of different cokes. All of the cokes had different chemical and physical properties. Single source cokes have homogenous chemical and physical composition in the whole size range while the blended coke had heterogeneous composition due to the mixture of different coke types used. The blended coke consisted of several different coke types (25) {{in order to meet the}} required specification. This work also describes new characterisation/measurement methods which can contribute to a better understanding of variations in material properties due to physical and mechanical changes in the calcined <b>coke</b> <b>feed</b> materials. Each step in the production of pilot scale anodes is described. A new method was developed for the characterisation of the mechanical strength of calcined coke. This method, the drop test, originates from the study of materials for road construction for the determination of the grain stability of rock materials. The method determines the coke grain strength in the entire size distribution. On the other hand, established measuring methods for calcined coke, HGI (ASTM D 5003 - 95) and grain stability (ISO 10142), determine only the mechanical strength in a specific size range, + 0. 6 - 1. 18 mm and + 4 - 8 mm, respectively. In other words, both methods give limited information about coke mechanical strength distribution throughout the whole size range, which is especially important when blended cokes are used. Additionally, the results from the drop test are expressed in volume reduction, size reduction, impact force and amount of fines below 148 μm generated during the test. A good correlation between ISO 10142 and the drop test was found. The results show good correlation between the size and volume reduction and the specific grinding energy. The method can also determine the grain strength of a specific size fraction which might be critical to further processing during anode production. Totally, about 8 tons of four calcined coke types were processed during this work. The majority of this material was ground in the air swept ball mill, for production of the finest fraction, dust. The pilot scale air swept ball mill circuit is identical to the equipment used in industry today. This investigation showed the importance of process optimisation for the stable production of dust with the required specification (particle size and Blaine). Each coke exhibited different behaviour in the grinding circuit, due to different mechanical strengths, which is reported as a specific grinding energy. The mechanically weakest coke produced dust with the lowest specific grinding energy. The particle size variation in the coke used in the mill produced a significant disturbance in the product quality. It was found that the sweeping speed through the mill influences the particle size distribution in terms of the proportion of the finest particles. It also affected the particle roundness of the produced dust, which can influence the flowability of the coke when mixed with pitch. The ratio of ball sizes and the rotational speed of the mill influenced the particle size distribution, Blaine and specific grinding energy. On-line particle size control was utilised during the dust production. This system allowed continuous control of the product size by regulation of the air classifier rotor speed. Three different dust sizes were produced in the air swept ball mill, which were all below about 200 μm but contained different proportions of material below 63 μm. Sieved coke fractions together with dust were weighed according to a specified recipe and blended in a sigma blade mixer together with coal tar pitch. A vibration compactor was used for the production of green anodes under optimal conditions. The anodes were produced with three different pitch contents (15, 18 and 20 wt%) and three different dust sizes (45, 63 and 94 %, - 63 μm). Core samples of green anodes were investigated in an improved dilatometer for the determination of thermal expansion and shrinkage during baking. Improvements made to the dilatometer during this work contributed to better reproducibility, increased precision and a healthier working environment. An increase in the heating rate influenced the initial expansion, shrinkage and baking loss of the anode. The heterogeneous pitch distribution throughout the anode due to the forming force, friction between coke particles and between the paste and mould showed the importance of selecting a consistent sampling position. The results showed that the bottom samples have greater expansion due to a thicker pitch bridge layer while the top samples have reduced expansion. The sample packing material contributed to a higher initial expansion due to the reduced free surface area for binder volatiles release, and the shrinkage was reduced because of the radial thrusts from the packing material. Thermal dilation results showed differences between samples with varying pitch, dust size and coke type, which can be used to indicate the final properties of baked anodes. A good correlation was found between the thermal dilation after the pitch expansion and the dust content. Green anodes were baked under controlled conditions and then characterised. The baked apparent density showed a good correlation with the pitch content and dust size. The results showed that 18 % pitch content and 63 % - 63 μm produced the highest baked densities. The variation in coke type exhibited differences in baked density, specific electrical resistance, air permeability, CO 2 and air reactivity and modulus of elasticity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$| fuel. A {{number of}} {{significant}} differences in the mode of occurrence of antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc were found between the two combustion plants studied. The element vanadium had almost identical modes of occurrence in fuel from both plants studied. A comparison of trace element mode of occurrence determined for the Collinsville power utility pulverised fuel by sequential leaching with mode of occurrence determined for the in-ground feed coals using graphical methods showed a reasonable level of agreement. It is concluded that the use of two methods of determining mode of occurrence provides better definition of mineral type in some cases. For example a siderite mode of occurrence could be determined using graphical relationship whereas the sequential leach data gave only a carbonate mode of occurrence. Further, the sequential leach data solved the problem of parallel graphical relationships. For example, galena was determined to be the mode of occurrence of lead from the sequential leach data, whereas graphical relationships indicated a pyrite mode of occurrence because of the relationship with sulphur. Combustion of coal occurs in three phases, namely devolatilisation, combustion of the volatile matter, and combustion of the residual char. Mineral matter may be excluded from the residual char particles due to desegregation and separation in the milling process, or included within the char particle. During combustion, trace elements partition between the bottom ash, the fly ash, and flue gas (lost up the stack). The concentration of trace elements in ash samples from the Collinsville and Mitsui power utilities was determined by INAA and XRF. The partitioning behaviour of the trace elements is examined by calculating relative enrichment values for the trace elements. Generally the partitioning behaviour and classification of trace elements in this study matched those found in previous published studies for a given element. The relative enrichment trends of elements exhibiting significant differences in mode of occurrence between the two combustion plants sampled (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to determine the control of mode of occurrence on the partitioning behaviour. It is hypothesised that the relative volatility of a particular element in combustion reflects the temperature at which the host mineral or the organic matter thermally decomposes. Thus organically bound elements should be more volatile than pyrite associated elements, which should be more volatile than carbonate associated elements, which should be substantially more volatile than silicate associated elements. Other factors that may influence partitioning behaviour such as the major element chemistry of the ash, plant design and operating conditions, and temperature variations within the combustion chamber were discounted as significantly influencing relative enrichment differences for the two combustion plants studied. It is concluded that element mode of occurrence has a strong influence on the relative volatility of a given element, and that comparison of sequential leach results from two pulverised fuel utilities has the potential allow prediction of the relative volatility of trace elements in combustion. Some complications may arise due to exclusion of some mineral grains and localised variations in the oxidation state within the combustion zone. Solid combustion wastes (fly ash and bottom ash) are commonly disposed of in landfill and impoundment facilities. Unless the landfill is impermeable to water, disposal of solid wastes in such fashion allows interaction with the hydrogeological system and could lead to detrimental environmental impacts. Leaching of indicative “total waste” composites made up by blending fly ash and bottom ash samples from each power utility in an 80 / 20 proportion was undertaken using the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in the leachates was compared to recreational water and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium, manganese, and selenium in the Collinsville leachate exceeds both the recreational and drinkwater guideline concentrations. The concentration of nickel in the Collinsville leachate was found to exceed the recommended drinkwater concentration, but is below recreational water guideline value. The concentration of boron and selenium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed both the recreational and drinkwater guideline values. The concentration of barium in the Mitsui leachate was found to exceed the drinkwater standard. The concentration of an element in the ash sample was found to be a poor indicator of the mobility of the element. Elements that showed substantial differences in mode of occurrence in the pulverised fuel (ie antimony, arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, selenium, uranium and zinc plus vanadium) were examined to assess the influence of mode of occurrence on the leachability of the element from solid combustion waste. It is concluded that, where the difference in element mobility between the two composite ash samples is significant, mode of occurrence does exert some control on the proportion of a trace element in the ash that can be mobilised by the TCLP protocol. In particular, trace elements present in coal associated with silicates appear substantially unavailable for mobilisation by the TCLP protocol. The concentration of trace elements in samples of <b>feed</b> coal, <b>coke</b> and breeze from the Bowen coke works was determined by INAA and XRF. A new index (the CRE index) was developed to characterise the enrichment or depletion of trace elements in the coke and breeze. Coke is classified as enriched (Class 1), neither enriched nor depleted (Class 2), depleted (Class 3) or highly depleted (Class 4). Breeze was classified as enriched (denoted “e”), neither enriched nor depleted (denoted “a”) and depleted (denoted “d”). Comparison of the partitioning behaviour of trace elements in combustion and carbonisation was undertaken by comparing the RE and CRE data. It is concluded that all but the most volatile elements (sulphur, selenium, arsenic and tungsten) are substantially retained in the coke. The substantial retention of trace elements in coke is likely due to the lower temperature at which carbonisation occurs compar...|$|R
