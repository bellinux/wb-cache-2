5|$|Beetles, both {{adults and}} larvae, are the prey of many animal predators {{including}} mammals from bats to rodents, birds, lizards, amphibians, fishes, dragonflies, robberflies, reduviid bugs, ants, other beetles, and spiders. Beetles {{use a variety}} of anti-predator adaptations to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> These include camouflage and mimicry against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick {{is based}} on a true story about a sperm whale that {{attacked}} and sank the whaleship Essex. Melville associated the sperm whale with the Bible's Leviathan. The fearsome reputation perpetuated by Melville was based on bull whales' ability to fiercely <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> from attacks by early whalers, occasionally resulting in the destruction of the whaling ships.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bees are}} aposematically coloured, {{typically}} orange and black, warning {{of their ability}} to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> with a powerful sting. As such they are models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the player}} enters the Throne Room with their prince, {{they become the}} king and takes control of the King's Guard. The other players lose {{the ability to control}} their men-at-arms, with their men staying in their rooms to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.|$|E
5|$|Strategies to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against predators {{include the}} {{expulsion}} of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, {{and their ability to}} hide. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.|$|E
5|$|Alienation is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4. The game is an isometric twin-stick shooter in which one to four players <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against an alien invasion on Earth through increasingly-difficult levels. Players can choose one of three character classes, {{each with its own}} abilities. Players can upgrade their weapons with collectables, known as upgrade cores.|$|E

5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{attack and}} <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or {{spraying}} chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments {{has been attributed to}} their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E

5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> and some species are {{parasitic}} or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Most rodents {{are small}} animals with robust bodies, short limbs, and long tails. They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food, {{excavate}} burrows, and <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> Most eat seeds or other plant material, but some have more varied diets. They {{tend to be}} social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other. Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy, to polygyny, to promiscuity. Many have litters of underdeveloped, altricial young, while others are precocial (relatively well developed) at birth.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel {{threatened}} or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves.</b> A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to <b>defend</b> <b>themselves</b> and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
