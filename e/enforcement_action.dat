25|$|The SEC {{formally}} investigated whether Brunson's {{offer and}} its publication violated federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud {{provisions of the}} Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of its investigation, the SEC subpoenaed documents and testimony from Brunson's lawyers. However, Brunson, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify in the investigation, directed his lawyers to withhold certain documents and not to testify on critical aspects of the offer, under the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine. The subpoena <b>enforcement</b> <b>action</b> sought to set aside these privileges on various legal grounds, including the crime-fraud exception, and to compel Brunson's firm to provide the requested documents and testimony.|$|E
25|$|Complaints to the U.K.'s Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{led to the}} FTC's <b>enforcement</b> <b>action.</b> In {{response}} to its initial complaint Judge Dean D.

Another, in the course of criticizing the failings of the European Union's Data Protection Directive when it came to dealing with cloud computing, did not criticize the <b>enforcement</b> <b>action</b> as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.|$|E
40|$|We {{highlight}} {{an important}} macro-financial linkage: Regulatory <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> on banks significantly reduce local economic growth. Exploiting {{the fact that}} regulatory <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> impose shocks on bank business activities {{beyond the control of}} bank executives, and controlling for loan demand conditions, we use difference-in-difference estimations to demonstrate that severe actions such as Formal agreements and Cease and desist orders imposed on single-market banks reduce personal income growth in rural U. S. counties by 0. 7 and 0. 4 percentage points, respectively. These effects are causally related to contractions in bank lending and liquidity creation. Our identification is sharpened by a series of tests based on placebo <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> that have no ramifications for local economic growth, and propensity score matching and instrumental variable techniques that account for the non-random assignment of regulatory actions.

SBTA president Kirby successfully established many new local councils, and resolved conflicts which threatened to sunder existing ones.

The offended larger union would then threaten {{to withdraw from the}} local alliance, taking its dues and influence with contractors went with it.

25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for a trademark owner to take <b>enforcement</b> <b>action</b> against all infringement {{if it can be}} shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E
25|$|Senior {{forestry}} officials cooperate {{on mutual}} issues concerning conservation {{and protection of}} forests and wildlife of the region. A regular conference of the forest ministers and forest officials of the southern states is held once a year, in rotation in each State. The Forest Ministers of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, senior officials of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, Forest Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Special Secretary for Forests, Andhra Pradesh, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, together with the senior forest officials of these states and the Union Territory of Pondicherry, met at Thiruvananthapuram on November 3 and 4, 2006 and resolved several mutual issues concerning conservation and protection of forests and wildlife of the region.

25|$|The Operations Section is {{composed}} of the five county field offices and certain units working citywide. Within the county field offices, deputy sheriffs assigned to civil law enforcement duties are referenced as Law Enforcement Bureau (LEB) personnel. LEB deputies perform {{a wide array of}} tasks such as evictions, warrants of arrest, orders to commit, and the seizure and sale of property pursuant to judicial mandates. Businesses and individuals that owe the city money pursuant to unpaid city tax warrants, environmental control board summons, and fire and health code violation fines, are targeted for <b>enforcement</b> <b>action.</b> LEB deputies also serve a wide variety of legal process, with orders of protection considered a priority. Each county field office is complemented by civilian support staff to assist in daily administrative functions and customer service. These field offices are accessible to the public, giving citizens of the county/borough a local place to file court process in need of enforcement. Deputies of the Operations Section may be assigned to duties separate from the LEB, either within a county field office or citywide. These duties include arrests and apprehensions on behalf of other city agencies such as the Human Resources Administration, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the Administration for Children's Services. Deputies may be assigned to scofflaw enforcement or security duties at the city treasury. The Operations Section will also provide deputies for any other assignment as deemed necessary by the agency.|$|E

40|$|One major {{purpose of}} federal and state {{regulation}} of banks is to ensure that institutions maintain safe-and-sound business practices. The main tool used to achieve this goal is bank supervision in general—and bank safety-and-soundness examinations in particular. Regulators conduct on-site examinations to ensure that bank operations are consistent with sound banking practices. When on-site examinations identify unsafe, unsound, or illegal banking practices, regulators use a variety of supervisory <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> to require institutions to take corrective measures. These <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> are intended to accomplish several things, including: bringing about alterations in the practices and behavior that caused the problems, stabilizing the institutions, and averting potential losses to the deposit insurance fund. Violations of enforcement agreements are a serious matter—noncompliance often carries heavy penalties, including the termination of deposit insurance. This article investigates the effects of bank examinations and <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> on the behavior of problem banks. We provide information on the effectiveness of supervision of distressed institutions through the issuance of formal <b>enforcement</b> <b>actions</b> during the 1980 s and 1990 s, a period of greater stress and turmoil for U.
