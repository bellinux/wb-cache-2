Patients with severe to profound hearing loss underwent Promontory Stimulation {{as well as a}} number of other diagnostic tests. One hundred and eighty eight ears comprised the study population and were grouped into congenital, non-congenital, cochlear, reirocochlear, sudden, and progressive hearing loss groups.

In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> rendering (HDR) and specular mapping.

In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the frame rate.

In August 2016, the Microsoft Windows version was updated to provide support for Nvidia's Ansel extension, which allows players to compose shots to be rendered in ultra-high resolutions or for 3D and virtual reality devices.

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} residue number system {{and how it}} {{can be used in a}} radio receiver. In this number system the numbers are divided up into several {{residues}}. Each of these residues is associated with one particular modulus. The main advantage of this number system is that, during arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication, the calculation for each residue can be done in parallel, independent of one another. This advantage can be utilised to improve the performance of several of the operations done in a radio receiver. In this thesis the operations FIR filtering, both using real and complex coefficients, and scaling is implemented using the residue number system for scaling and real FIR filter and the quadratic residue number system for the complex filter. In addition are RNS to binary and binary to RNS converters implemented. Both the RNS implementations of all these operations and their corresponding binary implementation are run through simulations to get data on their power consumption and area usage. The simulations are done for ASIC using a 55 nm technology library. The results illustrate that the chosen implementation of FIR filters, both real and complex, does not provide an advantage over the binary implementation unless the <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> required in the filter are very large. For filters covering <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> above 32 -bit, the area per tap is less for the RNS filter than for the binary. The power consumption per tap is assumed to be lower for filters with <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> above 24 -bit. The overhead by conversion increases as the <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> increases and thus counteracts the increased gain per tap in the same situation. The overhead by scaling is shown to be minimal, in therms of both area usage and power consumption, compared to the other components implemented in this thesis...|$|R
