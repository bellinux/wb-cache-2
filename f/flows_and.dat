The most destructive and most frequent events at Mount Baker have been lahars or debris <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> debris avalanches; many, if not most, {{of these were}} not related to magmatic eruptions but may have been induced by magma intrusion, steam eruptions, earthquakes, gravitational instability, or possibly even heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did not start before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E

30|$|As for DHN, {{there exists}} four {{different}} operating strategies, including constant <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> constant supply temperature (CF–CT), constant <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> variable supply temperature (CF–VT), variable <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> constant supply temperature (VF–CT), variable <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> variable supply temperature (VF–VT) [25, 34].

5|$|Exposed in {{the middle}} of the {{mountain}} range is an assemblage of deformed andesite to dacite lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> volcanoclastic sediments. These basement rocks were created during the late Mesozoic era, long before the Itcha Range formed.

5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|Mayon Volcano, the Philippines {{most active}} volcano. It {{has been the}} site of many {{different}} types of eruptions, Peléan included. Approximately 40 ravines radiate from the summit and provide pathways for frequent pyroclastic <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> mudslides to the lowlands below. Mayon's most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths.|$|E
30|$|The {{pressure}} dynamic {{flow curve}} {{can be divided}} into four stages: transient flow, first linear flow, first radial <b>flow,</b> <b>and</b> boundary dominated <b>flow.</b> The fracture length mainly affects the early linear <b>flow,</b> <b>and</b> permeability anisotropy mainly affects the mid-radial <b>flow,</b> <b>and</b> the degree of penetration in the reservoir and fracture orientation mainly affect the late spherical <b>flow,</b> <b>and</b> the boundary conditions and reservoir border width mainly affect the control flow. The method can be used to determine the optimal degree of opening shot, vertical permeability and other useful parameters.|$|R

5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic <b>flows,</b> <b>and</b> debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with trachytic texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> domes.|$|E

5|$|The Sugar Bowl eruptive {{period was}} short and {{markedly}} different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic <b>flows,</b> <b>and</b> lahars.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high-performance electronic devices and surge in power density accentuates {{the need for}} heat transfer enhancement. In this study, a thermal viscous dissipative Couette <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> Couette-Poiseuille <b>flow</b> in a channel filled with fluid saturated porous medium is looked into. Two cases of thermal boundary condition are considered: constant heat flux is applied on the moving wall while the fixed plate is insulated, and both plates are subjected to constant heat flux. The study would explore the fluid <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> heat transfer phenomenon for Couette <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> Couette-Poiseuille <b>flow</b> in a channel {{as well as to}} establish the relationship between the heat convection coefficient and viscous dissipation. A fully developed <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> local thermal equilibrium are assumed in the analysis. An analytical Nusselt number expression is developed for Couette <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> Couette-Poiseuille <b>flow</b> in terms of Brinkman number {{as a result of this}} study, thus providing essential information to gauge the thermal performance of a channel.

5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism at La Reforma began {{during the}} Pliocene, with ash <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> subaqueous pumice flows. Later {{activity}} became subaerial and generated pillow lava. Of the local volcanoes, La Reforma {{was the first}} to emerge from the sea. Four to five million years ago, basaltic dykes formed. Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava <b>flows</b> <b>and</b> the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{behavior}} of cerebral blood <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> oxygenation during prolonged brain activation was studied using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) sensitized to <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> oxygenation changes, as well as positron emission tomography sensitized to flow.

Nine types of activation stimuli or tasks, including motor activation, vibrotactile stimulation, and several types of visual stimulation, were used. Both <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> oxygenation were evaluated in separate time course series as well as simultaneously using two different MRI methods. In most cases, the activation-induced increase in <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> oxygenation remained elevated for the entire stimulation duration.
