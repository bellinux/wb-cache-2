The method was as follows: one of the metal electrodes usually employed in cardiology, {{was replaced by a}} water column by filling the catheter with a 20 % saline solution. The catheter, which is inserted via a wide vein (e. g. the internal jugular vein) was pushed upwards cm by cm until in the superior vena cava and further mm by mm until in the right atrium. The patient was connected with the 4 electrodes of an electrocardioscope; subsequently, at the ECG recording, either the electrodes for the left arm, or the thoracic electrodes were connected with the metal <b>extension</b> <b>piece</b> of the syringe containing the 20 % saline solution and attached to the endocavitary catheter. The morphological changes in the auriculogram, that could be followed on the electrocardioscope, allowed the determination of the exact localization of the catheter in the atrium at any moment during the moving of the catheter. Reading the auriculogram was simple, provided that some technical precautions were observed. The only obstacle in this method was formed by the patients having atrial fibrillation. The authors have abandoned the radiological control method in favour of the electrocardiographic control method, which, in their opinion, is the simplest, most correct and rapid method.

40|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} measurements {{have been}} performed to determine the full residual stress tensor along the expected crack path in an austenitic stainless steel (Esshete 1250) compact tension weld specimen. A destructive slitting method was then implemented on the same specimen to measure the stress intensity factor profile associated with the residual stress field {{as a function of}} crack length. Finally deformations of the cut surfaces were measured to determine a contour map of the residual stresses in the specimen prior to the cut. The distributions of transverse residual stress measured by the three techniques are in close agreement. A peak tensile stress in excess of 600 MPa was found to be associated with an electron beam weld used to attach an <b>extension</b> <b>piece</b> to the test sample, which had been extracted from a pipe manual metal arc butt weld. The neutron diffraction measurements show that exceptionally high residual stress triaxiality is present at crack depths likely to be used for creep crack growth testing and where a peak stress intensity factor of 35 MPa 2 ̆ 21 am was measured (crack depth of 21 mm). The neutron diffraction measurements identified maximum values of shear stress in the order of 50 MPa and showed that the principal stress directions were aligned to within 200 of the specimen orthogonal axes. Furthermore it was confirmed that measurement of strains by neutron diffraction in just the three specimen orthogonal directions would have been sufficient to provide a reasonably accurate characterisation of the stress state in welded CT specimens.

40|$|AbstractMuscle {{contraction}} {{results from}} rotation of actin-bound myosin crossbridges. Crossbridges consist of the globular N-terminal catalytic domain and the α-helical C-terminal regulatory domain containing the essential and regulatory light chains. The essential light chain exists in two isoforms, {{of which the}} larger one has a 41 -amino acid <b>extension</b> <b>piece</b> added at the N-terminus. The catalytic domain is responsible for binding to actin and for {{setting the stage for}} the main force-generating event, which is a “swing” of the regulatory domain. We measured the kinetics of the swing associated with the turnover of a single molecule of ATP. Muscle was labeled at the regulatory domain by replacing native essential or regulatory light chain with fluorescent adducts. The rotations were measured by the anisotropy of fluorescence originating from ∼ 400 crossbridges residing in a small volume defined by a confocal aperture of a microscope. The crossbridges were synchronized by rapid photogeneration of a stoichiometric amount of ATP. The rotations reflected dissociation from thin filaments followed by a slow reattachment. The dissociation was the same for each light chain (halftime ∼ 120 ms) but the rate of reattachment depended on the type of light chain. The halftimes were 920 ± 50 ms and 660 ± 100 ms for isoforms 1 and 3 of the essential light chain, respectively. The reason that the lifetimes were so long was creation of a small amount of ATP, enough only for a single turnover of crossbridges. A model was constructed that quantitized this effect. After accounting for the slowdown, the halftimes of dissociation and attachment were 34 and 200 ms, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Trawls and {{plankton}} nets {{are basically}} {{made up of}} conical and cylindrical net sections. In conical sections the flow will pass through the inclined net wall with a noticeable angle of attack, and then the flow, filtration and drag can be suitably modelled e. g. by a pressure drop approach [1]. In cylindrical and other non-tapered net sections, such as foreparts and <b>extension</b> <b>pieces</b> in trawls and plankton nets, the flow is directed along the net wall and is best considered {{in terms of a}} boundary layer. Boundary layer theory and turbulence models can be used to describe such flow, but this requires extensive numerical modelling and computational effort. Simplified approximate formulas providing a qualitative description of the flow with some quantitative accuracy are therefore also useful. This work presents simplified parametric expressions for boundary layer flow in cylindrical net sections, including the boundary layer thickness and growth rate along the net, the filtration velocity out of the net wall, the decrease in mass flux through the net due to the growing boundary layer, and the effect of twine thickness, flow (towing) velocity and the dimensions of the net. These expressions may be useful for assessing the existence and extension of a boundary layer, for appropriate scaling of boundary layer effects in model tests, for proper placement of velocity measurement probes, for assessing the influence on filtration and clogging of plankton net sections, and more...|$|R
40|$|Components {{operating}} at elevated temperatures can fail {{by the process}} of creep crack initiation CCI and growth CCG, which may be influenced by the presence of welding residual stresses. Therefore failures associated with welds are of major concern. CCG tests have previously been performed at 550 C on compact tension C T specimen weldments taken from a region of a circumferentially butt welded header. The specimens consisted of 316 L weld metal WM and 316 H parent material PM. The C T weldments were designed to allow the crack to grow along the fusion line within the heat affected zone HAZ. Electron beam EB welded <b>extension</b> <b>pieces</b> were attached to the extracted weldment to produce the required specimen dimensions. Both CCI and CCG in the HAZ of the weldment were found to be approximately six times faster than in similar parent material specimen tests. In this study, the presence of residual stresses in the specimen weldments is established by performing neutron diffraction measurements along the crack path. Measurements have been performed prior to and after the introduction and further extension of an EDM slit representing the crack in the C T specimens. Although high residual stresses were measured initially, these are found to relax significantly with the introduction of the slit and are approximately zero after slit extension. It is concluded from these results that the accelerated cracking in the specimen weldments can be attributed mainly to the reduced resistance to cracking in the HAZ material rather than the presence of residual stresse...|$|R
