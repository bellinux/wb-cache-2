Moreover, previous studies <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> behavior, to the extent that marital status is taken as given, may confound fertility and marriage behavior...|$|R

40|$|The present {{paper is}} the first to our {{knowledge}} that makes use of individual level data for a community of Southern Italy, Alghero, a town of about 10, 000 inhabitants situated on the North-western coast of Sardinia, a region whose demographic history has never been approached by means of nominative studies. As described in the next sections, the complex and detailed linkage of nominative information has been just finished, but it still needs some revision and data cleaning. For this reason, the present analysis is focused on the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> cohorts 1866 - 85 reconstructed on individual bases and investigated by means of micro-analytical techniques. Those couples married in a very peculiar phase of Italian history. In those years, in fact, it emerged a strong contraposition on marriage between the Church and the State. In 1866, the State introduced the new law on civil marriage, which in turn determined the legal invalidity <b>of</b> religious <b>marriages.</b> For the new Italian Kingdom, the sole legal marriage was the one celebrated before a civil official. This contrast between the Church and the State lasted until 1929, with consequences that make impossible any direct approach to the study <b>of</b> marital <b>fertility</b> based on official statistics (Livi Bacci 1977). In the present work, the nature and type <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> has been precisely used, along with other socio-cultural variables, such as profession and literacy level, to explain the pattern of reproductive behavior of the couples of Alghero in the very first stages of demographic transition...|$|R

40|$|Beyond natural sterility, {{there are}} two main types of childlessness: one driven by poverty and another by the high {{opportunity}} cost to child-rearing. We argue that taking childlessness and its causes into account matters for assessing the impact of development policies on fertility. We measure the importance of the components of childlessness with a structural model <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage.</b> Deep parameters are identified using census data from 36 developing countries. On average, one more year of education decreases poverty-driven childlessness by 0. 75 percentage points, but increases opportunity-cost-driven childlessness by 0. 57 percentage points from the 9 th year of schooling onwards. Neglecting the endogenous response <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and childlessness leads to overestimating the effectiveness of family planning policies, except where highly educated mothers are also heavily affected by unwanted births, and to underestimating the effect of promoting gender equality on fertility, except in countries where poverty-driven childlessness is high...|$|R
40|$|Unmarried {{fertility}} {{was a lot}} {{lower in}} the 1970 s than in the 1990 s. It was also the case that unmarried mothers had much lower marriage rates than non-mothers, a differential that has largely vanished over time. Could this marriage-market penalty have been strong enough to explain why unmarried fertility rates were lower then? To explore this issue, we introduce a new model <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage,</b> based on directed search. Relative to the existing literature, the essential contributions of the model are to allow for accumulation of children over the lifecycle and for the <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> single mothers. We use the model, in conjunction with US survey data, to explore the impact of marital prospects on the <b>fertility</b> decisions <b>of</b> unmarried women. We find that the decline, from the 1970 s to 1995, in <b>marriage</b> rates <b>of</b> unmarried women with no children, can account for the dramatic rise in unmarried women’s share of births over that period...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Based on {{aggregate}} statistics, {{the population}} of Israel, as compared to all or most other developed societies, has very high levels <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage</b> (e. g. TFR of 2. 96 in 2009 and only 9. 7 &#x 160; never married among women aged 40 - 44 in 2009). However, studying aggregate demographic measures is problematic, because Israel is an extremely heterogeneous society, with family formation patterns differing greatly across numerically important social groups. Until now, little has been documented about the basic <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage</b> behavior <b>of</b> different population groups. OBJECTIVE We describe the <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage</b> behavior <b>of</b> populations in Israel, broken down by nationality, religion, religiosity and nativity-status. Although our main focus is on a detailed presentation <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> patterns, we also look at marriage behavior, as it {{is closely related to}} fertility in Israel. METHODS We analyze recently available annual data from the Israel Social Surveys for 2002 - 2009, which, {{for the first time in}} several decades,, provides detailed information on family and household demographic behavior and direct information on level of religiosity. We focus primarily on comparisons across cohorts born from the late 1940 s to the late 1960 s and between periods in the early and late 2000 s. RESULTS We provide a detailed portrait of striking diversity in fertility and marriage behavior across population groups, along with important patterns of change and stability across cohorts and over time. We document findings and differential patterns, some unexpected, regarding comparisons across groups and across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The descriptive findings form the basis for a clearer understanding <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage</b> patterns in different population subgroups in Israel. In addition, the reported results suggest many questions for future research, which are outlined in the paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between migration process and marital behaviour in Kenya. Data for analysis came from the Kenya Demographic and Health Surveys (KDHS) of 1988 / 89 and 1993. The hypothesis was that, women who migrate comprise those that act rationally to maximise other lifetime aspirations {{at the expense of}} reproductive behaviours. That is, migrants are involved in behaviours that negatively influence <b>fertility</b> determining factor <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> compared to that of never-migrants. The paper contended that, migration dynamics are important in determining reproductive behaviour of women through time and space. The methods of estimating the association between migration process and marital behaviours were undertaken through several analysis techniques: Singulate mean age at marriage (SMAM); ordinary least squares (OLS) and; logistic regression (LR). Singulate mean age at <b>marriage</b> estimated patterns <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> by migration status by background variables. Ordinary least square regression was used to identify the impact of migration process on marriage behaviour relative to other factors. Logistic regression determined the probability that a woman will marry early or late among the migrants and never-migrants. Findings confirmed that migration negatively affects age at first marriage. Migrants marry relatively late compared to never-migrants...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present {{dissertation}} is to describe and analyse infant mortality in six German rural regions during the 18 th and 19 th century. The influence of possible causes or causative complexes on infant mortality is examined in a regional comparison. Depending on the factors to be checked, the inspection is performed on a macro-or microregional level. It is either based on exclusively quantitative or additional qualitative sources. The dissertation consists of two parts. In the first main part, factors are primarily treated that are only examinable on the basis of historical-demographical source material: e. g. sex, legitimacy/illegitimacy, age, <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> family size, birth status, seasonal patterns of mortality, and confession. The source basis is identical to that which had previously allowed the calculation of the values of infant mortality: based on vital statistics from church registers, families were reconstituted in village or community genealogies or with the help of genealogical tables. The data were encoded, computer-saved and prepared for further research in the Berlin Data Set. The Berlin Data Set {{is the result of a}} project in 1986 - 1990 led by A. E. Imhof at the Free University, Berlin, on the history of life expectancy in Germany from the 17 th to the 19 th century. In the second main part of the dissertation, the quantitative source basis is extended to qualitative sources. Medicinal topographies indicate region-specific differences in breast feeding and child care habits, while historical regional descriptions allow a contextual analysis of demographic and socio-economic change. The six rural surveyed regions that could be included in the comparison during the dissertation project are all situated in today`s western part of Germany: two in the north (eleven parishes in East Frisia and the parish of Hartum in the northern German lowland with four communities), two in the middle of Germany (eleven communities in the Hessian Schwalm region and nine parishes with 27 villages in the Saarland) and two in the south (six communities in Herrenberg/Wrttemberg and twelve communities in Ortenau in Baden on the upper Rhine river). During the surveyed period of time, the communities differed concerning law of inheritance and in economic, confessional, and cultural aspects. The total number of births (including stillbirths) per period that are included into the Berlin Data Set are approx. 12 000 in East Frisia, 10 000 in Hartum, 6000 in Schwalm, 13 000 in the Saarland, 12 500 in Herrenberg, and 35 000 in Ortenau. </FONT...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{demographic}} and genealogical history of # mountainous population, the Pomaks of Rodopi. Two administrative communities were studied, named Organi and Kehros. Respectively, they are located 40 and 70 Km away of Komotini, the capital of the Department of Rodopi in Greek Thrace. People are Muslims and they speak their own dialect. The economy of the area is confined to the primary sector of production and it can be characterized as pre-industrial. Raw data were collected concerning the natural movement of the population, the demographic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> system, immigration, emigration and the genealogical history of each member of the population. The pedigrees of the population were constructed and genealogical and demographic analysis took place. In the last case special emphasis was given to the demographic transition of the population. The results were compared with other local, regional or ethnic populations. After World War II a major fertility transition took place concerning both period and cohort rates. In the same manner, the <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriages</b> declines too. The marriage in this population is universal. Age at <b>marriage</b> <b>of</b> the grooms and the brides did not change substantially during time. On the contrary the age of the mother at her last child and the reproductive span decrease through time. As a result, between the marriage cohorts, the average number of births per mother and the final family size decline too. Mortality, and especially infant mortality, was quite high during 50 s and 60 s. With time, expectation of life at birth is improved and infant mortality diminishes. Fertility transition correlates positively with infant mortality transition. Later on, fertility transition {{is a result of the}} major sociocultural and economic transformations that took place in Pomaks society. Also some genealogical characteristics of the population were studied like territorial exogamy, mate exchanges and the marriages between relatives. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the impacts}} of HIV/AIDS on {{individual}} women and populations in severely affected areas of Sub-Saharan Africa is change in fertility levels. HIV/AIDS has influenced <b>fertility</b> <b>of</b> individual women through proximate determinants <b>of</b> <b>fertility,</b> namely, <b>marriage,</b> contraception, pregnancy, abortion, breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, pathological sterility and natural fecundity. Fertility may decline {{in the era of}} HIV/AIDS because of delayed onset of sexual relations and age at first union, reduced premarital sexual relations and remarriage and increased marital dissolution. Desired family size and condom use are also increased. HIV infected women experience reduced pregnancy rate and rising levels of induced and spontaneous abortion. HIV/AIDS induces sterility, increases foetal mortality and decreases frequency of sexual intercourse and production of spermatozoa. In contrast, the epidemic may increase fertility due to reduced extra marital relations, polygyny, breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, STD prevalence and spousal separation, increased infant mortality and switching to condom use from more effective contraceptives. Examples of sites in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia indicate that fertility has declined in populations hard hit by HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, it will take long durations of high HIV/AIDS prevalence to reduce fertility at a national scale...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of labor supply of women {{at different levels of}} poverty. It is widely demonstrated in the literature that variables such as age and level of education, as well as the demographic, social, and financial characteristics of the household affect the decision of labor supply. However, this study argues that these determinants work differently according to the poverty level or the well being of the household, adding another dimension to the literature on the female labor supply in MENA. There have been quite a few studies on the women’s labor supply in the MENA region.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the timing <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> and <b>marriage</b> in Sweden using exogenous {{variation in the}} age at school graduation that results from differences in birth month. Our analysis found that the difference of 11 months in the age at leaving school between women who were born in two consecutive months, December and January, implies a delay in the age at first birth of 4. 9 months. This effect of delayed graduation also persists for the timing of second births and first marriages, {{but it does not}} affect completed fertility or the overall probability <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> before age 45. These results suggest the existence of a relatively rigid sequencing of demographic events in early adulthood, and the age at graduation from school emerges as an important factor in determining the timing - but not the quantum - of family formation. In addition, these effects point to a potentially important influence of social age, defined by an individual's school cohort, instead of biological age. The relevance of social age is likely due to social interactions and peer-group influences exerted by individuals who are in the same school cohort but are not necessarily of the same age...|$|R

40|$|The Islamic Republic of Iran has {{experienced}} a remarkable demographic transition {{over the last three}} decades. As a result of social, demographic and economic changes, Iran’s fertility declined from 7. 0 births per woman in 1980 to around 1. 8 to 2. 0 in 2011 based on our estimation (McDonald et al. 2015). The initial rise and rapid fall <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> accompanied by a decline of child mortality led to a post-revolutionary youth bulge in the age distribution that will lead to rapid ageing in the longer-term future. Others have argued that Iran’s fertility has fallen to much lower levels - as low as 1. 5 births per woman (eg. Erfani 2013). Such low estimates led to the Government of Iran adopting a pronatalist policy with the aim <b>of</b> increasing <b>fertility,</b> although the components of the policy are still under discussion. Different views have been expressed on the role of family planning and other programs in meeting population policy goals in Iran in the future with some advocating the discontinuation of government assistance to family planning.

Using various datasets and detailed parity-based measures <b>of</b> <b>fertility,</b> the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>fertility</b> regulation practiced by Iranian couples are investigated. Our findings suggest that contraceptive use stabilized before 2000 and postponement of the first child and wide birth intervals are the main contributors to the level <b>of</b> <b>fertility.</b> Therefore, instead <b>of</b> discontinuation of the family planning program, policy to sustain fertility at its present level or a little higher needs to focus upon improving the economic circumstances of young people so that they are able to make less constrained choices about family formation than is the case at present...|$|R
