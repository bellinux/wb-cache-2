500|$|During {{her time}} with FERA, Hickok {{developed}} a dislike of reporters. In one report to Hopkins in 1934, she wrote, [...] "Believe me, the next state administrator who lets out any publicity on me is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> head cracked". In February 1934, Time called her [...] "a rotund lady with a husky voice, a peremptory manner, baggy clothes", a description that wounded Hickok. In {{a letter to}} Hopkins' secretary, she asked, [...] "Why the Hell CAN'T they leave me alone?" [...] Following the incident, Hickok and Roosevelt redoubled their efforts to keep their relationship out of the spotlight; on one occasion, Roosevelt wrote to her, [...] "we must must be careful this summer & {{keep it out of}} the papers when we are off together.|$|E
500|$|The third act {{continues}} in Gloria's bedroom suite. In the play's most controversial scene, {{a group of}} actresses enter the room while Wally hides in another room of the suite. They decide to play [...] "Stripping Cupid", a card-based strip game, and remove pieces of clothing onstage. One of them, Dot Madison, is down to her last two items of clothing when Wally returns to the room. The actresses leave, and Wally says he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> bag so he has it the next morning. While {{he is out of}} the room, Zeffie enters. Gloria asks Zeffie to hide in the bed, so when Wally returns she will see his advances firsthand. In a final plot twist, when Wally returns he has a telegram from his lawyer revealing that the Reno divorce is not valid. Gloria and Wally reconcile, and Zeffie gives her approval to the relationship between Betty and Chicky.|$|E
500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's {{going to change the}} image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
5000|$|... in October 2016, after 3 {{years at}} 5fm on the breakfast show and <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>his</b> own show (SOS) {{due to his}} growing {{popularity}} with listeners, Sol Phenduka resigned from 5FM with immediate to focus on other projects and his personal life. Some media outlets attributed this move to chronic depression that the radio personality suffered [...]|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile the {{students}} think Cap has died, blaming Zach and Hugh for his death. Both Zach and Hugh {{think they are}} ridiculous, but if Zach in particular is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>his</b> popular status he needs {{to take advantage of}} the situation. With Hugh he decides to arrange a memorial service for Cap in the school car parking lot.|$|R
50|$|Michael Allen Geist (born 11 July 1968) is a Canadian academic, and the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-Commerce Law at the University of Ottawa. Geist {{was educated}} at the University of Western Ontario where he {{received}} his Bachelor of Laws before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> Master of Laws at both Osgoode Hall Law School and Cambridge University. After that, he attended Columbia Law School where he got his Doctor of Law degree.|$|R
2500|$|... "A lot {{of times}} {{we thought he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> head cut off," [...] one Australian said. [...] "Everyone who was there would say that they got home because of Reg." [...] Another said: [...] "We were lucky to have Reg Newton and that is {{evidenced}} {{by the fact that the}} casualties in D Force were one of the lowest and it was definitely because of him." [...] His men realized his unorthodox measures gave them the best chance of survival.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Young Si's place," [...] said Agnes. [...] "He {{lives there}} night and day. Wouldn't it make anyone melancholy? No wonder he's mysterious. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> spyglass. He told me I might always use it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. He's {{only got}} two sides, a bad {{side and a}} worse side, which he sticks on on the {{strength}} of being fairly good at games. I wonder if he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> First this season. He's not a bad bat.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not so}} hard to eat as {{they had}} feared, for their slender necks enabled them to bend their heads low. Chubbins' hat fell off, a minute later, and he {{wondered}} how he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it on <b>his</b> head again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. Uncle Doc says I'm to go {{to school}} in a week or so. He says I must have an eddication, and he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help dad <b>get</b> <b>his</b> money and invest it so it's safe, and all that. Here's yer dollar." ...|$|R
60|$|Godolphin was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all <b>his</b> old company {{together}} {{as far as}} possible, {{with the exception of}} Miss Pettrell, and there was to be little or no delay, because the actors had mostly got back to New York, and were ready to renew their engagements. That no time might be lost, Grayson asked Maxwell to come the next morning and read the piece to such of them as he could get together in the Argosy greenroom, and give them his sense of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and that}} fellow may be fixed {{to change his}} {{appearance}} a good deal," [...] added Spud. [...] "A man isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on four thousand dollars without doing all he possibly can {{to get away with}} it, especially when he knows that if he is caught he will be sent to prison." ...|$|E
60|$|Just at this moment, Rollo's cousin James {{came into}} the yard, and Rollo ran to him, {{to explain to him}} about the parachute. After {{describing}} to him the construction of it, and its use by men who go up in balloons, he said he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> father's umbrella, which would make an excellent parachute.|$|E
60|$|When Mr Chivery, {{who was on}} duty, {{admitted}} {{them into}} the Lodge, he saw something in their faces which filled him with astonishment. He stood looking after them, when they hurried into the prison, as though he perceived that they had come back accompanied by a ghost a-piece. Two or three Collegians whom they passed, looked after them too, and presently joining Mr Chivery, formed a little group on the Lodge steps, {{in the midst of}} which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the Father was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> discharge. Within a few minutes, it was heard in the remotest room in the College.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think that's a {{beautiful}} plan, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{try to buy}} a fiddle any more; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Dan <b>his</b> net all myself, {{and if there is}} any money left, I'll do something to please poor Billy. He's fond of me, and though he isn't poor, he'd like some little thing from me, because I can make out what he wants better than the rest of you." [...] And Nat fell to wondering how much happiness could be got out of his precious three dollars.|$|R
60|$|When {{the third}} man arrived his wife gave him his supper, and after {{that he went to}} bed, just as usual. The next morning a boy knocked at the door, bidding him attend the burial of the man who was dead, and he was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up when <b>his</b> wife stopped him.|$|R
50|$|Juan's {{physical}} body keels over dead {{into an open}} grave, while his spirit is lowered into a trapdoor. Instead of being dragged into Hell as the legend suggests, the lifeless puppet merely falls into a compartment beneath the stage. Upon discovering an inanimate Don Juan, The Jester asks how he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> paid with <b>his</b> master dead.|$|R
6000|$|He {{fixed his}} large, {{colourless}} eyes upon her. [...] "That's {{where you can}} help him," [...] he answered. [...] "If he and I combine forces, we can pull this through {{in spite of the}} furious opposition {{that it is going to}} arouse. Without a good Press he is helpless; and where is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> Press backing if he turns me down? From half a dozen Socialist papers whose support will do him more harm than good. If he will bring the working class over to Protection I will undertake that the Tariff Reformers and the Agricultural Interest shall accept his Socialism. It will be a victory for both of us.|$|E
6000|$|He took {{leave of}} Miss Lynde, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> coat and hat for his walk {{home when he}} was mysteriously stopped {{in a corner of}} the stairs by one of the caterer's men whom he knew. It is so unnatural to be {{addressed}} by a servant at all unless he asks you if you will have something to eat or drink, that Westover was in a manner prepared to have him say something startling. [...] "It's about young Mr. Lynde, sor. We've got um in one of the rooms up-stairs, but he ain't fit to go home alone, and I've been lookin' for somebody that knows the family to help get um into a car'ge. He won't go for anny of us, sor." ...|$|E
60|$|As for Hilbert, who had set {{off from}} the smoke pipe deck {{at the same time}} with Jennie, and in an equally eager manner, his going below had been with an entirely {{different}} intent from hers. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> bow and arrows, in order to shoot the little bird. He found them on the seat where he had left them. He seized them hastily, and ran up by the forward gangway, which brought him out upon the forward deck not very far from where the bird was resting upon the coil of rigging. He crept softly up toward him, and adjusted, as he went, his arrow to his bow. Several of the sailors were near, and one of them, a man whom they called Hargo, immediately stopped the operation that he was engaged in, and demanded of Hilbert {{what he was going to}} do.|$|E
5000|$|... 2011: There {{were reports}} that Bea Alonzo was a snob to Gerald Anderson during the awards night as he was linked to her before. Alonzo denied the issue, however, {{explaining}} that her seat is far from him. Since she was already a latecomer, {{she does not want}} to make a scene by <b>going</b> there just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> attention.|$|R
60|$|To the {{careless}} eye {{the scene}} on the Main Street of a summer afternoon is one of deep and unbroken peace. The empty street sleeps in the sunshine. There is a horse and buggy tied to the hitching post in front of Glover's hardware store. There is, usually and commonly, the burly figure of Mr. Smith, proprietor of Smith's Hotel, standing in his chequered waistcoat {{on the steps of}} his hostelry, and perhaps, further up the street, Lawyer Macartney going for his afternoon mail, or the Rev. Mr. Drone, the Rural Dean of the Church of England Church, <b>going</b> home <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> fishing rod after a mothers' auxiliary meeting.|$|R
5000|$|That {{the verb}} go {{as used in}} this {{construction}} is distinct from the ordinary lexical verb go {{can be seen in}} the fact that the two can be used together: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go to the store now." [...] Also the lexical use of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> is not subject to the contractions to gonna and similar: [...] "I'm gonna <b>get</b> <b>his</b> autograph" [...] clearly implies the future meaning (intention), and not the meaning [...] "I'm <b>going</b> somewhere order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> autograph." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the morning}} of the Fourth, and Frank was so anxious to get through with his wood-sawing, and begin celebrating {{with the rest of the}} boys, that he hardly knew what to do. He had a levvy (as the old Spanish real used to be called in {{southern}} Ohio) in his pocket, and he was going to buy a pack of shooting-crackers for ten cents, and spend the other two cents for powder. He had no pistol, but he knew a fellow that would lend him his pistol part of the time, and he expected to have about the best Fourth he ever had. He had been up since three o'clock watching the men fire the old six-pounder on the river-bank; and he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> mother to let him go up to the fireworks in the court-house yard after dark.|$|E
60|$|The fourth {{member of}} the Board, Mr. Malan, was a foul and {{objectionable}} brute. His personal courage was better suited to insulting the prisoners in Pretoria than to fighting the enemy at the front. He was {{closely related to the}} President, but not even this advantage could altogether protect him from taunts of cowardice, which were made even in the Executive Council, and somehow filtered down to us. On one occasion he favoured me with some of his impertinence; but I reminded him that in war either side may win, and asked whether he was wise to place himself in a separate category as regards behaviour to the prisoners. 'Because,' quoth I, 'it might be so convenient to the British Government {{to be able to make}} one or two examples.' He was a great gross man, and his colour came and went on a large over-fed face; so that his uneasiness was obvious. He never came near me again, but some days later the news of a Boer success arrived, and on the strength of this he came to the prison and abused a subaltern in the Dublin Fusiliers, telling him that he was no gentleman, and other things which it is not right to say to a prisoner. The subaltern happens to be exceedingly handy with his fists, so that after the war is over Mr. Malan is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> head punched quite independently of the general settlement.|$|E
50|$|During the 1995 budget debates, after Democrats {{claimed that}} Social Security {{payments}} would leave seniors with {{no choice but}} to eat dog food, Rush Limbaugh said in jest that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> mother a can opener. Schroeder denounced Limbaugh's remark {{on the floor of the}} House.|$|E
5000|$|Another mob boss, called Apellido, {{begins to}} take over the city and sends a huge squad of [...] "bullet monkeys" [...] (inferior but cheaper gunsharks) after Billi Octavo. Sinister {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her out of the city but the other hitmen are chasing the two. Meanwhile, Dexter is with Detective Weld when he hears the news and rushes out of the house with his guns drawn. By chance he is seen by a police officer who tells him <b>to</b> freeze, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out <b>his</b> handcuffs. Dexter misinterprets this as the officer going for his gun and kills him, thereby breaking the gunshark code. He escapes but doesn't get very far before being surrounded. Fearful of being tortured in prison a standoff ensues, and he is eventually shot by Weld. Sinister is last seen speeding out of the city, with a wounded Billi octavo in the car, still pursued by the bullet monkeys.|$|R
60|$|When Captain Burke {{observed}} the Dunkery Beacon steaming in his direction, and soon afterwards perceived a signal on this steamer {{to the effect}} that she wished to speak with the yacht, he began to hope that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>his</b> difficulties. The natural surmise was that as one of the pirates had gone to join another just arriving upon the scene, the Dunkery Beacon--the Captain and crew of which must have turned traitors--was now coming to propose some arrangement, probably to give up Shirley if the yacht would agree to go its way and cease its harassing interference.|$|R
5000|$|Stephen Schneider said of {{him that}} [...] "Jaworowski is perhaps even more contrarian than most, {{claiming}} that he can prove the climate is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> colder through <b>his</b> work excavating glaciers on six different continents, which he says indicates what we should really be worrying about is 'The approaching new Ice Age...'."http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/CliSciFrameset.html?http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Climate/Climate_Science/Contrarians.html#Contrarians Jaworowski wrote The current sunspot cycle is weaker than the preceding cycles, and the next two cycles will be even weaker. Bashkirtsev and Mishnich (2003) expect that the minimum of the secular cycle of solar activity will occur between 2021 and 2026, which {{will result in the}} minimum global temperature of the surface air.

50|$|Cobb {{realizes he}} is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> woman and breaks down. Tommy realizes {{that there is a}} solution, namely that a pair of lonely women (ostensibly prostitutes) would {{certainly}} welcome Cobb's presence. Cobb proceeds to their house, and although it is across the border in Texas, where he is a wanted outlaw, the women roughly throw him off his horse and gleefully drag him across.|$|E
50|$|In The Gnome King of Oz, he is helped off {{the island}} by Peter Brown, an {{athletic}} boy from Philadelphia, making {{his first trip to}} Oz. As in Ozma of Oz, Ruggedo is quite friendly when he thinks he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> way.

50|$|The next morning, as Ponzi {{comes to}} pick up Silvio at his place, he tells him that the school has been shut down and they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> invade and occupy. When they reach the school, Silvio {{is one of the}} lads that <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> a backdoor. They rush in and let the rest of the crowd in. The school is taken, Silvio is {{exploring}} the grounds along with Martino's girl (who, we learn, is a long lost love interest of his). They break into the archives and Silvio tells her that Martino is bragging about having sex with her. She gets mad about it and they make out. Silvio is thrilled and ends up telling Ponzi all about it on his way out (he was <b>going</b> home <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> sleeping bag, <b>get</b> back and sleep over at the school, hoping <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more intimate with the girl). Ponzi couldn't keep the secret and so the rumour is out. And the story builds up as it <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> Martino's ear. He gets furious and decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things right with Silvio and his girlfriend. The rumours of the archive kisses reach the girl's ear, now she thinks Silvio is just another boy.|$|R
5000|$|Westaway told a {{reporter}} from Home and Away Official Collector's Edition that Kyle is a damaged individual {{who grew up with}} no love in his life because he was young when his mother died. His oldest brother Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) identifies good within Kyle and can see that he has been damaged and misplaced his trust with Danny. But Kyle's good side has been buried in the crimes he committed. Westaway's biggest challenge when portraying Kyle is [...] "keeping his edge because he's constantly trying to maintain a balance. If he becomes too vulnerable he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt, and if he shuts himself off he's never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anywhere with <b>his</b> brothers.". Westaway has to visit the show's make-up department who create a brush-on tattoo for his scenes as Kyle. The actor enjoys his character's dark persona and spent hours practicing Kyle's [...] "death stare" [...] in front of a mirror.|$|R
60|$|Dan at once {{agreed to}} {{accompany}} the girl to Mount Pleasant when he heard that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things for <b>his</b> master. Looking about he found an old basket and they started without delay by the one road from the clearing which led, they had no doubt, to the town. It was about two miles distant, and was really but a large village. A few Federal soldiers from the camp hard by were lounging about the streets, but these {{paid no attention to}} them. Lucy soon made her purchases, and then went to the house that had been pointed out to her as being inhabited by the doctor who attended {{to the needs of the}} people of Mount Pleasant and the surrounding district. Fortunately he was at home. Lucy looked at him closely as he entered the room and took his seat. He was a middle-aged man with a shrewd face, and she at once felt that she might have confidence in it.|$|R
