Each night, the band performed {{one of their}} first three albums (The Fall of Troy, Doppelgänger and Manipulator) in their entirety. During the VIP reunion show, the band announced they would continue making music in 2014 by releasing an album free of charge. In December 2014, Thomas Erak announced that he left Chiodos to focus on The Fall of Troy's new album and his family.

25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E

I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Li'l Sebastian, {{a miniature}} horse beloved by {{the residents of}} Pawnee, was first introduced in [...] "Harvest Festival", which was also written by Goor. The writers considered having a human character die in [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] rather than the miniature horse, like previously-mentioned characters Mayor Gunderson or Councilman Bill Dexhart. However, they decided that having an animal character die felt less morbid and more appropriate for the finale of a comedy series. The episode ends with Tom and Jean-Ralphio in their new Entertainment 720 headquarters, a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture. Schur described the setting as [...] "maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series. ...

But we feel comfortable with where he is relative to Sunday and where he’s capable of being next week." [...] Although the January 1 practice {{was expected to be}} normal, Tomlin allowed players to leave after team meetings and a walk-through.

Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault.

Originally, Joseph DaVinci & Soulja Boy created the song's beat but {{according}} to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later {{came up with the}} idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took [...] "about a day" [...] for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and it makes us feel like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's just putting on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'."

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode.

[...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Ron Swanson received critical acclaim; {{he developed a}} cult following and is widely considered the show's breakout character.

[...] Gabriel Perna of International Business Times wrote, [...] "Offerman's Ron Swanson {{is one of the main}} reasons to watch Parks and Recreation. Considering how funny the show is and the scope of its cast, that says a lot." [...] Likewise, Gail Pennington, television critic with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called Nick Offerman [...] "the funniest guy on TV," [...] and TV Fanatic writer Eric Hochberger said, [...] "There's certain character <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> this show for: Ron Swanson." [...] Jonah Weiner of Slate.com said Ron [...] "has regularly stolen his scenes" [...] and that Offerman has [...] "a gift for understated physical comedy," [...] and Steve Heisler of The A.V.

500|$|In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a {{film critic}} for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said [...] "Don’t expect a deep, {{underlying}} narrative.

First and foremost, it shocked me– and that’s not easy given how many movies <b>I</b> <b>watch.</b> It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious." [...] Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film {{takes a long time to}} [...] "get going" [...] due to a [...] "silly establishment skit". However, she concluded that [...] "there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [...] shores". Although opining that the film was [...] "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide [...] "challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag".|$|E
500|$|Robert Thompson, a {{professor}} of communications {{and director of the}} Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told The New York Times, [...] "There is something kind of unique about [...] It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it". In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the frames." [...] In a 2007 interview, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite TV character and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants is [...] "the show <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> with my daughters". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also said he watches the series with his children.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 {{asked about the}} Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> how people behave around them.
