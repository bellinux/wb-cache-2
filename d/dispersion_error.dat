Based on this approach, new high-order isogeometric elements with the reduced <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> {{have been developed}} for wave propagation problems in the 1 -D case. By the modification of the mass and stiffness matrices, the order of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> is improved from order 2 p (the conventional elements) to order 4 p (the new elements) where p is the order of the polynomial approximations. It was shown that the new approach yields the maximum order of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> for the stencil equations related to the high-order isogeometric elements. The analysis of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> of the high-order isogeometric elements with the lumped mass matrix has also shown that independent of the procedures for the calculation of the lumped mass matrix, the second order of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> cannot be improved with the conventional stiffness matrix.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 Finite Difference (FD) schemes {{have been}} used widely in {{computing}} approximations for partial differential equations for wave propagation, as they are simple, flexible and robust. However, even for stable and accurate schemes, waves in the numerical schemes can propa- gate at different wave speeds than in the true medium. This phenomenon is called numerical <b>dispersion</b> <b>error.</b> Traditionally, FD schemes are designed by forcing accuracy conditions, {{and in spite of}} the advantages mentioned above, such schemes suffer from numerical dispersion errors. Traditionally, two ways {{have been used}} for the purpose of reducing dispersion error: increasing the sampling rate and using higher order accuracy. More recently, Finkelstein and Kastner (2007, 2008) propose a unified methodology for deriving new schemes that can accommodate arbitrary requirements for reduced phase or group velocity dispersion errors, defined over any region in the frequency domain. Such schemes are based on enforcing exact phase or group velocity at certain preset wavenumbers. This method has been shown to reduce dispersion errors at large wavenumbers. In this dissertation, we study the construction and behaviors of FD schemes designed to have reduced numerical <b>dispersion</b> <b>error.</b> We prove that the system of equations to select the coefficients in a centered FD scheme for second order wave equations with specified order of accuracy and exact phase velocity at preset wavenumbers can always be solved. Furthermore, from the existence of such schemes, we can show that schemes which reduce the <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> uniformly in an interval of the frequency domain can be constructed from a Remez algorithm. In these new schemes we propose, we can also specify wavenumbers where the exact phase or group dispersion relation can be satisfied. For an incoming signal consisting of waves of different wavenumbers, our schemes can give more accurate wave propagation speeds. Furthermore, when we apply our schemes in two dimensional media, we can obtain schemes that give small <b>dispersion</b> <b>error</b> at all propagation angles...|$|E
