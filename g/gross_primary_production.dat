Macroalgae, {{which were the}} predominant primary producers of the lagoon, reduced markedly, but neither phytoplankton nor seagrasses replaced them. Temporal and spatial changes in macroalgal standing crop (SC) and phytoplankton concentration were investigated between 1987 and 1998. Maps of macroalgal SC show a marked declining trend. Biomass in fresh weight decreased from: 558 ktonnes in 1987, to 85 ktonnes in 1993 and to 8. 7 ktonnes in 1998. As a whole, the biomass in 1998 was only 1. 6 % of the biomass recorded in 1987. Similarly the macroalgal net (NPP) and <b>gross</b> (GPP) <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> decreased from ca. 1502 and 9721 ktonnes year(- 1) to ca. 44 and 229 ktonnes year(- 1), respectively.

Maps of chlorophyll a drawn according to data collected in parallel to macroalgal standing crop show unchanged concentrations. Macroalgae changes are enhanced by comparing annual trends in four areas of the central lagoon during 1989 - 1992 and 1998 - 1999. In those areas phytoplankton also decreased significantly.

This turbulence aids phytoplankton growth by supplying bottom-layer nutrients into the subsurface chlorophyll maximum but reduces phytoplankton concentrations in the thermocline by mixing cells from the base of the subsurface maximum into the bottom mixed layer. The turbulent dissipation observations were used to estimate an average nitrate flux into the thermocline of 2. 0 (0. 8 – 3. 2, 95 % confidence interval) mmol m 22 d 21, which is estimated to have been capable of supporting new phytoplankton growth at a rate of 160 (64 – 256) mg C m 22 d 21.
