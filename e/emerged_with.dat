5|$|However, {{since this}} initial skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.

5|$|In the 1890s, {{a dispute}} {{about how the}} club was to be owned and run <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> John Houlding, Anfield's {{majority}} owner and Everton's Chairman, at the forefront. Houlding and the club's committee initially disagreed about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell escalating into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. Two such disagreements included Houlding wanting Everton to sell only his brewery produce during an event and for the Everton players to use his public house The Sandon as changing room facilities.|$|E
5|$|Middle English {{literature}} <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> Geoffrey Chaucer, {{author of}} The Canterbury Tales, along with Gower, the Pearl Poet and Langland. William of Ockham and Roger Bacon, who were Franciscans, were major philosophers of the Middle Ages. Julian of Norwich, who wrote Revelations of Divine Love, {{was a prominent}} Christian mystic. With the English Renaissance literature in the Early Modern English style appeared.

Despite limited experience in top level half marathon races, Wilson Kiprop and Florence Kiplagat won their respective races. Kiprop broke Zersenay Tadese's winning streak which dated back to 2006, out-sprinting the defending champion in the final stages. Sammy Kitwara won the men's bronze medal and helped Kenya to the men's team title. Led by Zersenay, the Eritrean men beat Ethiopia to the team silver medal spot.|$|E
5|$|The band <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> a {{heavy metal}} sound {{on their first}} studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a {{dominant}} act in the alternative metal movement, {{with the release of}} their second album, Ænima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued, with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim, and commercial success around the world.|$|E

5|$|After {{a troubled}} {{pre-production}} characterized by legal disputes, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> the franchise's property rights in early 1990. This {{paved the way}} for the completion of the screenplay by a Cameron-led production team, and the October 1990 start of a shortened 186-day filming schedule. The production of Terminator 2 required a $102 million budget making it the most expensive film made up to that point. Much of the film's massive budget was spent on filming and special effects. The film was released on July 3, 1991, in time for the U.S. Independence Day weekend. In 2017, Terminator2 was re-released in 3D, 4K resolution for AMC and Cineplex theaters. The re-released debuted at number one in the United Kingdom during the weekend of its release.|$|E
5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), and Zero History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E

The party had won 69.5 percent of the popular vote, the highest popular vote share ever attained by the PC party in the province. Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district. The next month Williams' Progressive Conservatives increased their seat count to 44 out of 48, after winning a deferred election in Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans following the death of Liberal candidate Gerry Tobin on October 1.|$|E
5|$|At Stanford, Hammonds {{was named}} an All-American. The Orioles {{selected}} Hammonds with the fourth overall {{selection of the}} 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was seen {{as one of the}} best prospects in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed a three-year, $21.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that off-season, but continued to struggle with injuries. He had a resurgence with the Giants in 2003, after he was released by the Brewers, but struggled with the Giants in 2004 and Nationals in 2005 before retiring.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical disaster for the communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E

5|$|In Albrecht's {{role with}} the 2012–13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 {{points in a}} game before the NCAA Tournament. In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 lead and never led by less than 10 {{the rest of the}} game. Several players had career-highs in the game, including Albrecht who had 7 points and 3 steals. The national championship rounds were held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. In the April 6 national semifinal against Syracuse, Michigan <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> its thirty-first victory, the most since the 1992–93 team went 31–5.

5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set out to prove the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure <b>emerged</b> <b>with</b> large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
