Strip historian Allan Holtz notes {{over the years}} these strips have featured regular NEA characters, adapted classic Christmas stories, and original stories with single-appearance characters. The 1942 strip, [...] "Santa's Victory Christmas," [...] had a WWII-era theme of conserving raw materials to further the war effort and was drawn by Superman ghost artist Leo Nowak. The 1967 entry, Bucky's Christmas Caper, was written and drawn by famed comic book creator Wally Wood.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Hedonic Treadmill" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Brickman and Campbell in their article [...] "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" [...] (1971), {{describing}} the tendency of people to keep a fairly stable baseline level of happiness despite external events and fluctuations in demographic circumstances. The idea of relative happiness had been around for decades when in 1978 Brickman et al. began to approach hedonic pleasure {{within the framework of}} Helson's adaptation level theory, which holds that perception of stimulation is dependent upon comparison of former stimulations. The hedonic treadmill functions similarly to most adaptations that serve to protect and enhance perception. In the case of hedonics, the sensitization or desensitization to circumstances or environment can redirect motivation. This reorientation functions to protect against complacency, but also to accept unchangeable circumstances, and redirect efforts towards more effective goals. Frederick and Lowenstein classify three types of processes in hedonic adaptation: shifting adaptation levels, desensitization, and sensitization. Shifting adaptation levels occurs when a person experiences a shift in what is perceived as a [...] "neutral" [...] stimulus, but maintains sensitivity to stimulus differences. For example, if Sam gets a raise he will initially be happier, and then habituate to the larger salary and return to his happiness set point. But he will still be pleased when he gets a <b>holiday</b> <b>bonus.</b> Desensitization decreases sensitivity in general, which reduces sensitivity to change. Those who have lived in war zones for extended periods of time may become desensitized to the destruction that happens on a daily basis, and be less affected by the occurrence of serious injuries or losses that may once have been shocking and upsetting. Sensitization is an increase of hedonic response from continuous exposure, such as the increased pleasure and selectivity of connoisseurs for wine, or food.|$|E

5000|$|While small {{businesses}} employ {{over half the}} workforce in the US [...] and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation, {{the quality of the}} jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the Secondary labour market. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms. Additionally, many {{small businesses}} struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid <b>holidays,</b> <b>bonuses,</b> insurance, and retirement plans. Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms. Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that {{they are more likely to}} lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation. The U.S. Small Business Administration counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as [...] "small businesses", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.|$|R

50|$|In 1959 he and {{his friends}} took the {{historic}} trip down the River Kwai. They made their way through the thick forest from Kanchanaburi, a small town northwest of Bangkok, to the Burmese border. They lashed together a raft from bamboo poles {{with the help of a}} local who had plied through the forest to reclaim rails from the death railway built by Allied war prisoners during the Second World War, a task made famous by the movie, “The Bridge on the River Kwai”. From the source of the River Kwai they floated down the river on a handmade raft, capsizing at times on unexpected steep rapids. It was supposed to be a seven-day adventure trip. No one had any idea where exactly they were and how many more days were needed to get back to the office. Being late or absent was a serious offense in a tightly run Swiss office. They got finally back five days late and paid the price - a cut in <b>holidays</b> and <b>bonuses.</b> An image that Rolf Schnyder took during this adventure appeared on the cover of the Swiss magazine, Schweizer Illustrierte. An account of this trip, penned by Schnyder, could be found within its pages. It was the first of many travel reports published in Swiss and other European papers and magazines. In the next few years, Schnyder continued to explore Thailand, Laos, Bali, Cambodia and South Vietnam, where the war had just started.|$|R
30|$|Whatever {{the root}} causes, our {{contention}} {{is that such}} research is potentially fruitful and may offer insights that are not apparent in the existing broader literature. First, {{there is certainly a}} need to continue to test alternative theories of the turnover—performance relationships that already appear in the literature. Indeed, as Shaw, Gupta, et al., (2005) and others have pointed out, tests of differential or competing theories are needed in the literature, as are attempts to integrate these alternative theories (see Nyberg and Ployhart, 2013; Shaw et al., 2013). Second, it is certainly possible that turnover—performance dynamics operate differently in Chinese organizations, leaving open the possibility for new theoretical development and empirical comparisons against existing conceptual foundations. Third, there are many clear differences in employment relationships, workforce management, and the labor market in China. These contextual factors could be brought to bear as antecedents of turnover rates, or as moderating factors between workforce outflow and performance. Fourth, Chinese organizations face some temporal and seasonal challenges that are unique. For example, there are severe, yet somewhat predictable, mass turnover events after the Lunar Year <b>Holiday</b> and/or after <b>bonus</b> payments. In addition, many organizations near metropolitan centers deal with frequent influx and outflow of migrant workers, which creates administrative, hiring, exit, and productivity-related challenges that are not seen in Western countries where the residential population and labor market are more stable.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} the pre-CLNY (Chinese Lunar New Year) {{effect in the}} pre-holiday returns of the Hang Seng index by using simplest generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticty - GARCH (1, 1) model. The period investigated is from 2002 to 2007. This study reveals two major findings. First, by testing the returns on trading days preceding 11 Hong Kong public holidays, empirical results indicates that pre-holiday returns are significant higher than mean returns of any other trading days and therefore implying unusual returns patterns for Hang Seng index on trading days prior to holidays closing. The second results of this paper are consistent with prior research in {{that there is a}} strong pre-CLNY effect in many Asian stock markets especially in Hong Kong market. Strong evidence shows the highest mean returns can be achieved on two trading days immediately prior to Chinese Lunar New Year and this effect tend to be more persistent compared to other pre-holiday returns over the sample period in Hong Kong stock market. Three related explanations including cultural effect, positive <b>holiday</b> sentiment and <b>bonus</b> payment factor play important role in explaining the significant pre-CLNY effect. The current empirical findings benefit both big investment institutions and small individual stock traders. Hence, investors may able to improve their returns by taking better trading strategy and drawing more profitable decisions based on the presence of pre-CLNY effect in Hong Kong stock market. The investment suggestion recommended in the study suggests investors selling stocks out on two days prior to Chinese Lunar New Year as it generates the highest return. In other words, it is also the worst day to purchase stocks...|$|R
