40|$|This chapter {{describes}} a personal aerosol sampler with size fractionation and time resolution that gives samples for elemental analysis. An <b>impaction</b> <b>stage</b> collects coarse particles and a filtration stage collects finer ones. Sampling in consecutive time intervals is performed on different impaction and filtration surfaces. These sampling surfaces corresponding, for example, to 15 -min intervals, may be analyzed with particle-induced X-ray emission analysis (PIXE) for fast, low-cost determination {{of most of}} the elements of hygienic interest that are present in aerosols in concentrations far below their current threshold limit values (TLV). The sampler is intended to be used for aerosol measurements in work environments to obtain detailed information on exposures...|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{successful}} real-time {{detection of}} airborne pathogenic microorganisms, the problem {{must be considered}} in terms of their physical size and biological characteristics. We developed an airborne microorganism detection chip to realize the detection of microorganisms, ensuring compactness, sensitivity, cost-efficiency, and portability, using three key components: an inertial impaction system, a cartridge-type impaction plate, and a mini-fluorescent microscope. The inertial impaction system was used to separate microorganisms in terms of their aerodynamic particle size, and was fabricated with three impaction stages. Numerical analysis was performed to design the system; the calculated cutoff diameter at each <b>impaction</b> <b>stage</b> was 2. 02 (first stage), 0. 88 (second stage), and 0. 54 μm (third stage). The measured cutoff diameters were 2. 24, 0. 91, and 0. 49 μm, respectively. A cartridge-type impaction plate was used, composed of molded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and an actual impaction region made of a SYBR green I dye-stained agar plate. A mini-fluorescent microscope was used to distinguish microbes from non-biological particles. Images of the microorganisms deposited at the impaction zone were obtained via mini-fluorescent microscopy, and fluorescent intensities of the images were calculated using in-house image-processing software. The results showed that the developed system successfully identified aerosolized biological particles from non-biological particles in real time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFly ashes from {{combustion}} {{sources are}} great of interest since {{they can be}} a risk for health and environment. Number size distribution of aerosols can be obtained using the Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI), which is dependent on the density ρ. However, the density ρ of the particles is specified by the user and assumed to be constant for the twelve stages. Besides, ρ cannot be measured with usual methods since there is not enough matter collected on each stage of the ELPI. ρ is proportional to the square of the aerodynamic diameter dae over the equivalent (Stokes) diameter deq. Our approach uses electronic microscopy to evaluate ρ at each stage to increase the accuracy of the number size distributions given by the ELPI. Firstly, particles were collected on glass substrates stuck by capillarity on the <b>impaction</b> <b>stages.</b> Then, images were acquired with an electron microscope, and finally, processing tools were applied : pretreatment (noise and contrast), segmentation (discrimination of the particles) and measurement (form factor to check the circularity and area to deduce deq). This method was applied to Silica particles which are defined to have a constant density (ρ = 2. 5 g. cm- 3 with the pycnometer) : density was found to be 2. 2 g. cm- 3 and 2. 4 g. cm- 3 for stages 2 (dae 57 nm to 95 nm) and 3 (dae 95 nm to 158 nm), respectively. The results match reality for fly ashes from wood combustion with ρ varying from 1. 1 g. cm- 3 to 2. 4 g. cm- 3, respectively for <b>impaction</b> <b>stages</b> 2 to 8...|$|R
40|$|Samplings of {{atmospheric}} particulate matter (PM) were carried out between the months of March and April of 2007, simultaneously in two areas of Londrina, an urban (Historical Museum) and other rural (Farm School-UEL). PM was collected using the cascade impactor consisting of four <b>impaction</b> <b>stages</b> (0. 25 to 10 &# 956;m). The {{results indicated that the}} fine fraction (PM 2. 5) represented {{a significant portion of the}} mass of PM 10 (70 and 67 % in the urban and rural places, respectively). Cl-, NO 3 - and SO 4 (2 -) were determined by ion chromatography and the size distribution is presented.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a compact high volume cascade impactor (HVCI). The HVCI operates at a ow rate of 900 l/min and consists of 4 <b>impaction</b> <b>stages</b> equipped with circular slit-shaped acceleration nozzles and a backup l-ter. The backup lter is placed downstream of the fourth stage and is used to collect the ultra ne particles (dp < 0. 1 m). The major feature of this novel sampler {{is its ability to}} collect relatively large amounts of particles (mg–g levels) onto relatively small polyurethane foam substrates without using adhesives. As previously reported, the capacity of the impaction substrate is 2. 15 g of collected particles per cm 2 of foam. Although the im-paction substrates are not coated with adhesives such as grease or mineral oil, particle bounce and re-entrainment losses were found not to be signi cant. Particles can be easily recovered from the foam substrates using aqueous extraction. The impactor was calibrated using polydisperse particles. The 50 % cutpoints of the 4 stages were 9. 90, 2. 46, 1. 0, and 0. 1 m, respectively. In-terstage losses of ultra ne and ne particles were < 10 % and for coarse particleswere< 20 %. The pressure drop across the 4 stages and the backup lter were 0. 25, 0. 75, 1. 25, 19. 9, and 3. 3 kPa, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAerosols from {{combustion}} {{sources are}} of high concern since they present a risk {{for health and}} environment. Particle size distribution of aerosols and in particular number size distribution are easily and quickly obtained using an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI). However, this technique is depending of aerosol density; q, which may lead to biased particle size distributions. Aerosol density from combustion sources is usually not well known and depends on several parameters. Aerosol density cannot be measured with usual methods since there is generally not enough matter collected on each stage of the ELPI. Our approach uses electronic microscopy to evaluate q at each <b>impaction</b> <b>stage</b> {{in order to increase}} the accuracy of the number size distributions resulting from the ELPI measurements. Particles were collected on glass substrates deposited on each impaction stages. Images were obtained using a scanning electron microscope and image processing tools were applied. This method was first tested with silica particles resulting from a combustion process which have a constant density found to be comprised between 2. 2 and 2. 4 g cm 3 for stages 2 (57 and 95 nm) and 3 (95 and 158 nm), respectively. Once validated, this method was used to determine the density of wood combustion aerosols. The results match well for fly ashes from wood combustion with densities varying from 1. 1 to 3. 0 g cm 3 for particles of mean equivalent diameter ranging from 69 to 157 nm, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCascade impactors {{are widely}} used to provide {{particle}} size distributions {{for the study of}} aerosols in workplaces and ambient air. In the frame of exposure assessment to airborne particles, one of their main advantages is the possibility to perform further off-line analysis (e. g. electron microscopy, physical-chemical characterization by XRD, ICP-MS, etc.) on the collected samples according to particle size. However, the large channel width makes the particle size distributions not enough size-resolved. Furthermore, in spite of the sharpness of the collection efficiency curves, the existence of an overlap between stages renders data interpretation difficult. This work aim was to develop a modular program allowing the inversion of data stemming from cascade impactors based on the mass (or any quantity) collected on each <b>impaction</b> <b>stage.</b> Through a precise description of the collection efficiency curves of the different stages, the software provides a continuous curve (from 100 to 1000 points) using the Markowski method, and more particularly the Twomey iterative algorithm, according to several publications about inverse problems in cascade impactors. An additional option consists in determining the experimental error at each point of the inverse curve, performed by realizing several consecutive inversions. The inversion procedure was first tested and optimized for the case of the SIOUTAS personal sampler. Validation of the calculation was performed considering theoretical aerosols. Then, the software was used for two sets of data obtained during field measurement campaigns...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{relative}} precision of two different abbreviated impactor measurement (AIM) systems and a traditional multi-stage cascade impactor (CI). The experimental design was chosen to provide separate estimates of variability for each impactor type. Full-resolution CIs are useful for characterizing the aerosol aerodynamic particle size distribution of orally inhaled products during development but are too cumbersome, time-consuming, and resource-intensive for other applications, such as routine quality control (QC). This article presents a proof-of-concept experiment, where two AIM systems configured to provide metrics pertinent to QC (QC-system) and human respiratory tract (HRT-system) were evaluated using a hydrofluoroalkane-albuterol pressurized metered dose inhaler. The Andersen eight-stage CI (ACI) served as the benchmark apparatus. The statistical design allowed estimation of precision with each CI configuration. Apart from one source of systematic error affecting extra-fine particle fraction from the HRT-system, no other bias was detected with either abbreviated system. The observed bias was shown to be caused by particle bounce following the displacement of surfactant by the shear force of the airflow diverging above the collection plate of the second <b>impaction</b> <b>stage.</b> A procedure was subsequently developed that eliminated this source of error, as described in the second article of this series (submitted to AAPS PharmSciTech). Measurements obtained with both abbreviated impactors were very similar in precision to the ACI for all measures of in vitro performance evaluated. Such abbreviated impactors can therefore be substituted for the ACI in certain situations, such as inhaler QC or add-on device testing...|$|E
40|$|PhDElectrostatics of {{aerosols}} for inhalation is {{a relatively}} new research area. Charge properties of these particles are largely unknown but electrostatic forces have been proposed to potentially influence lung deposition. Investigation on the relationship between formulation and aerosol charging is required to understand the fundamental mechanisms. A modified electrical low pressure impactor was employed to measure the particles generated from metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers. This equipment provides detailed size and charge information of the aerosols. The particles were sized by <b>impaction</b> onto thirteen <b>stages.</b> The net charges in twelve of the size fractions were detected and recorded by sensitive electrometers. The drug deposits were quantified by chemical assay. The aerosol charge profiles of commercial metered dose inhalers were product-dependent, which was due to differences in the drug, formulation, and valve stem material. The calculated number of elementary charges per drug particle of size ≤ 6. 06 μm ranged from zero to several ten thousands. The high charge levels on particles may have a potential effect on the deposition of the aerosol particles in the lung when inhaled. New plastic spacers marketed for use with metered dose inhalers were found to possess high surface charges on the internal walls, which was successfully removed by detergent-coating. Detergent-coated spacer had higher drug output than the new ones due to the reduced electrostatic particle deposition inside the spacer. Particles delivered from spacers carried lower inherent charges than those directly from metered dose inhalers. Those with higher charges might be susceptible to electrostatic forces inside the spacers and were thus retained. The electrostatic low pressure impactor was further modified to disperse two commercial Tubuhaler® products at 60 L/min. The DPIs showed drug-specific responses to particle charging at different RHs. The difference in hygroscopicity of the drugs may play a major role. A dual mechanistic charging model was proposed to explain the charging behaviours. The charge levels on drug particles delivered from these inhalers were sufficiently high to potentially affect deposition in the airways when inhaled. Drug-free metered dose inhalers containing HFA- 134 a and 227 produced highly variable charge profiles but on average the puffs were negatively charged, which was thought to be due to the electronegative fluorine atoms in the HFA molecules. The charges of both HFAs shifted towards neutrality or positive polarity with increasing water content. The spiked water might have increased the electrical conductivity and/or decreased the electronegativity of the bulk propellant solution. The number of elementary charges per droplet decreased with decreasing droplet size. This trend was probably due to the redistribution of charges amongst small droplets following electrostatic fission of a bigger droplet when the Raleigh limit was reached...|$|R
40|$|The {{abbreviated}} impactor measurement (AIM) {{concept is}} a potential solution to the labor-intensive full-resolution cascade impactor (CI) methodology for inhaler aerosol aerodynamic particle size measurement. In this validation study, the effect of increasing the internal dead volume on determined mass fractions relating to aerodynamic particle size was explored with two abbreviated impactors both based on the Andersen nonviable cascade impactor (ACI) operating principle (Copley fast screening Andersen impactor [C-FSA] and Trudell fast screening Andersen impactor [T-FSA]). A pressurized metered dose inhaler-delivered aerosol producing liquid ethanol droplets after propellant evaporation was chosen to characterize these systems. Measures of extrafine, fine, and coarse particle mass fractions from the abbreviated systems were compared with corresponding data obtained by a full-resolution ACI. The use of liquid ethanol-sensitive filter paper provided insight by rendering locations visible where partly evaporated droplets were still present when the “droplet-producing” aerosol was sampled. Extrafine particle fractions based on impactor-sized mass were near equivalent in the range 48. 6 % to 54 %, comparing either abbreviated system with the benchmark ACI-measured data. The fine particle fraction of the impactor-sized mass determined by the T-FSA (94. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 7 %) was greater than using the C-FSA (90. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 4 %) and almost identical with the ACI-measured value (95. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 4 %). The improved agreement between T-FSA and ACI is likely the result of increasing the dead space between the entry to the induction port and the uppermost <b>impaction</b> <b>stage,</b> compared with that for the C-FSA. This dead space is needed to provide comparable conditions for ethanol evaporation in the uppermost parts of these impactors...|$|E
40|$|Impaktoren ermoeglichen eine groessenabhaengige Auftrennung und Abscheidung von atmosphaerischen Aerosolpartikeln sowie die nachgeschaltete chemische Analyse dieser Partikelfraktionen. Leider sind diese Instrumente mit dem Mangel behaftet, dass Partikeln auf den Abscheideflaechen nicht immer haften bleiben, sondern abprallen und auf der nachfolgenden Stufe gesammelt werden. Die vorliegende Untersuchung widmet sich den Sammelverlusten eines Berner Niederdruck Impaktors. In Zusammenarbeit mit der InAMed GmbH in 82131 Gauting wurden radioaktiv markierte Testaerosole erzeugt und die Sammeleigenschaften des Impaktors unter verschiedenen Feuchtebedingungen untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Impaktor, wenn auf den Abscheideflaechen kein Haftmittel eingesetzt wird, erst bei relativen Feuchten groesser etwa 60 % ein geeignetes Messinstrument darstellt. Bei geringen Feuchten von 30 % prallen bis 80 % der 0. 25 #mu#m Testaerosole von den Sammelstufen ab, bei 60 % immer noch um 30 %. Unguenstige Stroemungsverhaeltnisse auf den hinteren Impaktorstufen verschlechtern die Abscheidequalitaet, so dass hier etwa 10 % Wandverluste auftreten. Ausserdem werden Nebenabscheidungen sichtbar, wodurch die hinteren Impaktorstufen an Trennschaerfe verlieren. Da der Einsatz von Haftmitteln haeufig Probleme fuer die nachfolgende chemische Analyse der Impaktorproben mit sich bringt, kommt eigentlich nur der Betrieb des Impaktors unter kontrollierten Feuchtebedingungen in Frage. Fuer zukuenftige Messungen an ''global {{atmosphere}} watch'' (GAW) -Stationen muss daher ein Konzept entwickelt werden, wie die Probenahme feuchtekontrolliert verbessert werden kann. (orig.) Impactors {{offer the}} opportunity for a size-dependent separation and collection of atmospheric aerosol particles as well as for a chemical analysis of the particle fraction afterwards. Unfortunately, impactors suffer from bounce-off of particles being collected on an <b>impaction</b> <b>stage</b> that is designed to collect smaller particles. This research deals with collection losses of a Berner low pressure impactor. In cooperation with InAMed GmbH in 82131 Gauting radioactive labelled test aerosols were generated in order to check the collection efficiency of this impactor type under different humidity conditions. The results clearly show, that the impactor being operated without coating impaction substrates with grease or a sticky oil is only a suitable instrument at relative humidity above 60 %. At 30 % humidity about 80 % of the 0. 25 #mu#m test aerosol bounced and at 60 % humidity about 30 %. Non ideal streamlines at the backward impaction stages deteriorate the collection efficiency causing wall losses of about 10 %. Additionally depositions have been observed, resulting in a shift of the cutoff curve for small particles. Because coating may interfere with the chemical analysis of the collected particles it would be advantageous to run the impactor at controlled relative humidity. For future impactor measurements at global atmosphere watch (GAW) stations a concept should be developed how to improve particle collection at controlled relative humidity. (orig.)
