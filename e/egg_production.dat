5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to {{the complete loss of}} quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies. These quail are closely related to the common quail, and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E

5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. This is the most labour saving and economical method of <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E

The gross {{domestic}} product for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow economic growth rate, further declined following the extensive damage. The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens, and {{in the face of}} high repair costs the island saw below-standard levels of holiday season consumption.|$|E
5|$|Silkies lay a {{fair number}} of eggs, of a cream color, but {{production}} is often interrupted due to their extreme tendency to go broody; a hen will produce 100 eggs in an ideal year. Their capacity for incubation, which has been selectively bred out of most fowl bred especially for <b>egg</b> <b>production,</b> is often exploited by poultry keepers by allowing Silkies to raise the offspring of other birds. In addition to being good mothers, Silkies are universally renowned for their calm, friendly temperament. They do well in confinement, and interact very well with children. This docility can cause Silkies to be bullied by more active or aggressive birds when kept in mixed flocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of {{a mature}} colony includes a fertile female and male, {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for <b>egg</b> <b>production.</b> The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and <b>egg</b> <b>production</b> may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

40|$|To make inferences {{concerning}} a population, parametric methods are traditionally used for sample data analysis assuming that these come from ordinary populations, which not always happens. Most {{of the times}} such assumption leads to inadequate conclusions and decisions, especially when the data are distributed asymmetrically. It was aimed on this work to adjust some plausible models {{for this type of}} data, aiming to compare <b>eggs</b> <b>productions</b> in quails of different lines through frequentist and Bayesian methods. In the analyzed data it could be verified that the parametric and non-parametric frequentist procedures were, in general, equally conclusive. The Bayesian procedure was the only one which detected difference between the yellow and red lines, regarding the preconized energy diet, and between the blue and yellow for the second eclosion group. By the frequentist methods differences between the blue and red lines were not found; however, given a Poisson distribution for the <b>eggs</b> <b>production,</b> through multiple comparisons between the posterior mean under the Bayesian focus, differences were found between all lines. For being more sensitive, besides flexible, such procedure detected differences not observed by the traditional methods between the yellow and red lines, in the higher energy diet; between the blue and the red one in the second eclosion group and in general. It was concluded that quails of the yellow line showed bigger <b>eggs</b> <b>production,</b> regardless of the eclosion group and diet. Such results raise the discussion on the appropriate use of methods and procedures for statistical data analysis...|$|R

A resistance index (RI) was generated for each pure line or accession by combining the root galling severity and nematode <b>egg</b> mass <b>production</b> ratings such that RI = (root galling severity rating 2 + <b>egg</b> mass <b>production</b> rating 2). Reaction classes were defined as immune (RI = 2), highly resistant (RI = 3 8), resistant (RI = 9 18), moderately resistant (RI = 19 32), intermediate (RI = 33 50), moderately susceptible (RI = 51 72), susceptible (RI = 73 98), and highly susceptible (RI = 99 162).
