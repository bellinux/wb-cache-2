40|$|The CODE Theory of Visual Attention (CTVA) is a {{mathematical}} model explaining the effects of grouping by proximity and distance upon reaction times and accuracy of response with regard to elements in the visual display. The predictions of the theory agree quite acceptably in one and two dimensions (CTVA- 2 D) with the experimental results (reaction times and accuracy of response). The difference between reaction-times for the compatible and incompatible responses, known as the response-compatibility effect, is also acceptably predicted, except at small distances and <b>high</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> distractors. <b>Further</b> results using the same paradigm at even smaller distances have been now obtained, showing greater discrepancies.

40|$|Published online: 2 December 2013 This paper {{presents}} a game-theoretic {{model of a}} liberalized railway market, in which train operation and ownership of infrastructure are vertically separated. We analyze how the regulatory agency will optimally set the charges that operators {{have to pay to}} the infrastructure manager for access to the tracks and how these charges change with increased competition in the railway market. Our analysis shows that an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> competitors in the freight and/or passenger segment reduces prices per kilometer and increases total output in train kilometers. The regulatory agency reacts to more competition with a reduction in access charges in the corresponding segment. Consumers benefit through lower prices, while individual profits of each operator decrease through a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> competitors. We <b>further</b> show that the welfare effect of increased competition in the freight and/or passenger segment is ambiguous and depends on the level of competition.

In this paper, a novel reconfigurable architecture for networks-on-chip (NoC) on which arbitrary application-specific topologies can be implemented with backtracking which provides guaranteed throughput is presented. The proposed NoC supports {{multiple applications}} by configuring its topology to the topology which matches the input application and also supports a dead-and-live lock free dynamic path set-up scheme.

40|$|Abstract—Linguistic fuzzy {{modeling}} in high-dimensional regres-sion problems {{poses the}} challenge of exponential-rule explosion when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables and/or instances becomes high. One way {{to address this problem}} is by determining the used variables, the linguistic partitioning and the rule set together, in order to only evolve very simple, but still accurate models. However, evolv-ing these components together is a difficult task, which involves a complex search space. In this study, we propose an effective multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that, based on embedded genetic database (DB) learning (involved variables, granularities, and slight fuzzy-partition displacements), allows the fast learn-ing of simple and quite-accurate linguistic models. Some efficient mechanisms have been designed to ensure a very fast, but not pre-mature, convergence in problems with a <b>high</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables. <b>Further,</b> since additional problems could arise for datasets with a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instances, we also propose a general mechanism for the estimation of the model error when using evolutionary al-gorithms, by only considering a reduced subset of the examples. By doing so, we can also apply a fast postprocessing stage for fur-ther refining the learned solutions. We tested our approach on 17 real-world datasets with different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> variables and in-stances. Three well-known methods based on embedded genetic DB learning have been executed as references. We compared the different approaches by applying nonparametric statistical tests for multiple comparisons. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method {{not only in terms of}} scalability but in terms of the simplicity and generalizability of the obtained models as well.

40|$|Background and objectivesHemodialysis {{is one of}} the {{therapeutic}} modalities of the end stage renal disease (ESRD). As inadequate dialysis is considered a risk factor leading to higher morbidity and mortality, determination of adequacy of dialysis is necessary. This study was conducted to determine adequacy of dialysis in continuous hemodialysis patients in Kamkar and Hazrat Vali Asr Hospitals in the state of Qom, Iran. Methods This cross sectional descriptive-analytic study was conducted in 2006. The study variables were age, gender, height, weight and duration of dialysis. Data were collected by a questionnaire and URR, dKt/V, eKt/V and pKt/V were calculated. For statistical analysis, t-test, Fisher’s exact test and Pearson correlation were employed. Results Of 238 patients, 51. 7 % and 48. 3 % were males and females respectively. The average age was 55. 27 ± 16. 79 years. Mean values of dKt/V, eKt/V, pKt/V and URR were 1. 03 ± 0. 232, 0. 89 ± 0. 196, 1. 18 ± 0. 254, and 57. 46 ± 8. 42 respectively. The percent of adequate dialysis in eKt/V, pKt/V and URR were 26. 5 %, 44. 5 % and 21 % respectively. The mean age of insufficient eKt/V group was higher than adequate eKt/V group and t test showed a significant statistical correlation. Fisher’s exact test showed a significant correlation between adequate eKt/V and female gender, and also between eKt/V and URR. But chi-square test did not show a significant correlation between eKt/V and underling disease. Conclusion We found that hemodialysis is inadequate in a <b>high</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patients. <b>Further</b> studies with larger sample numbers are recommended to determine the underlying cause of this inadequacy.

Less {{is known about}} the outcomes of MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin in pediatric patients. This study reviews the outcomes and clinical characteristics of MRSA bacteremia in children treated with vancomycin and characterizes the microbiologic and molecular features of the bloodstream isolates. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin for > 5 days from 1 August 2005 to 31 May 2007 in a large tertiary care center. MRSA bloodstream isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR analysis of virulence genes, and Diversilab typing. Clinical records were reviewed for outcomes and comorbidities. A total of 22 pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia were identified. Eleven cases (50. 0 %) were considered vancomycin treatment failures. Features significantly associated with vancomycin treatment failure were prematurity (P = 0. 02) and isolates positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) (P = 0. 008). Features typically associated with community-associated MRSA strains were identified in hospital-associated isolates. A dominant clone was not responsible for the <b>high</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> treatment failures. <b>Further</b> studies are needed to determine if vancomycin should be the first-line treatment for MRSA bacteremia in premature infants and for PVL-positive isolates...|$|R

40|$|Chemokines, such as CXCL 10, promote hepatic {{inflammation}} {{in chronic}} or acute liver injury through recruitment of leukocytes to the liver parenchyma. The CXCL 10 receptor CXCR 3, which is expressed on {{a subset of}} leukocytes, plays {{an important part in}} Th 1 -dependent inflammatory responses. Here, we investigated the role of CXCL 10 in chemically induced liver fibrosis. We used carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) to trigger chronic liver damage in wildtype C 57 BL/ 6 and CXCL 10 -deficient mice. Fibrosis severity was assessed by Sirius Red staining and intrahepatic leukocyte subsets were investigated by immunohistochemistry. We have further analyzed hepatic stellate cell (HSC) distribution and activation and investigated the effect of CXCL 10 on HSC motility and proliferation. In order to demonstrate a possible therapeutic intervention strategy, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of a neutralizing anti-CXCL 10 antibody. Upon CCl(4) administration, CXCL 10 -deficient mice showed massively reduced liver fibrosis, when compared to wildtype mice. CXCL 10 -deficient mice had less B- and T lymphocyte and dendritic cell infiltrations within the liver and the <b>number</b> and activity <b>of</b> HSCs was reduced. In contrast, natural killer (NK) cells were more abundant in CXCL 10 -deficient mice and granzyme B expression was increased in areas with <b>high</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> NK cells. <b>Further</b> detailed analysis revealed that HSCs express CXCR 3, respond to CXCL 10 and secrete CXCL 10 when stimulated with IFN. Blockade of CXCL 10 with a neutralizing antibody exhibited a significant anti-fibrotic effect. Our data suggest that CXCL 10 is a pro-fibrotic factor, which participates in a crosstalk between hepatocytes, HSCs and immune cells. NK cells seem {{to play an important role}} in controlling HSC activity and fibrosis. CXCL 10 blockade may constitute a possible therapeutic intervention for hepatic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCalculation of tail probabilities {{remains very}} {{challenging}} {{even with the}} most recent and performing uncertainty quantification techniques. To tackle this problem, this work aims at proposing an efficient method basing on Monte Carlo method, importance sampling and interpolation methods making use of Adjoint states. Several approaches are proposed in literature for using adjoint evaluations for accelerating Monte Carlo convergence. Generally, they rely on {{the building of a}} linear approximation in order to compute the small probability that the objective function exceeds a certain critical value, usually representing the probability that a system fails or suffers catastrophic losses. The adjoint calculation is then used to calculate the sensitivity gradient, which can be used to approximate the objective function as a linear function of the random variables describing the sources of uncertainty. The information provided by this linear approximation permits to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo method using control variate and importance sampling. The method proposed here is based on a continuous update of the interpolation function via the gradient computation, which is then used with the importance sampling technique. The advantages of such an approach is to improve and retain the good convergence properties of MC methods when treating a very <b>high</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dimension, by <b>further</b> accelerating the convergence by using the interpolation on functional evaluations and gradients. The interest of this kind of approach for predicting non-classical gasdynamics phenomena is then demonstrated with several examples, such as the computation of a rarefaction shock wave (RSW) in a dense-gas shock tube. In this case, since a RSW is relatively weak and that the prediction of its occurrence and intensity are highly sensitive to uncertainties on the initial flow conditions and on the fluid thermodynamic model, the objective is to obtain a reliable estimate for the RSW probability of occurrence...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examines {{three major}} research questions: 1) {{the role of}} impulsivity and emotional intelligence in restrained eaters 2 ̆ 7 behaviors, 2) if menu calorie labeling will be utilized by restrained eaters to make healthier eating decisions, and 3) if mindful eating can effectively alter a restrained eater 2 ̆ 7 s behavior. Specifically study one examines the role of impulsivity and emotional intelligence in restrained eaters 2 ̆ 7 behavior. Previous research has found restrained eaters to have less healthy eating behaviors than unrestrained eaters. Emotional intelligence {{has been shown to}} result in healthier eating behaviors, whereas impulsivity negatively impacts eating behavior. Results show impulsivity does not moderate the relationship between restraint and unhealthy eating behaviors in this data. More restraint was associated with higher BMI. Restrained eaters are characterized as having episodes of disinhibited eating, which result in weight gain despite constant dieting. Increased emotional intelligence was associated with higher BMI and a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> calories selected. <b>Further,</b> increased impulsivity was associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> calories selected as well. Results also indicate that the three commonly used measures of restraint yielded similar results when used separately in the model, indicating they measure the same construct. The Herman and Polivy (1980) restraint scale showed two interaction effects that the Eating Inventory (formerly Three Factor Eating Questionnaire) and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire did not. Study two investigates whether new Affordable Care Act legislation requiring restaurants to provide menu calorie labeling will be effective in reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> calories restrained eaters consume. This legislation has spurred numerous studies on this topic recently. Study two is unique, however, because it uses an eye tracking methodology to investigate this relationship. In this research, restrained eaters were found to dwell on menu calorie information significantly longer than unrestrained eaters. Finally, study three explores a mindful eating intervention as a method by which to train restrained eaters to make healthier decisions. Recent psychology literature has found mindfulness to be an effective treatment method for numerous disorders, including eating disorders.

Under this generalized framework of higher order nonclassicality, conditions of higher order squeezing and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics are derived. A simpler {{form of the}} Hong-Mandel higher order squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an operator ordering theorem introduced by us in [J. Phys. A. 33 (2000) 5607]. It is also generalized for multi-photon Bose operators of Brandt and Greenberg. Similarly, condition for higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is derived by normal ordering <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>number</b> operator. <b>Further,</b> {{with the help of}} simple density matrices, it is shown that the higher order antibunching (HOA) and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA and HOSPS may exist even in absence of the corresponding lower order phenomenon. Binomial state, nonlinear first order excited squeezed state (NLESS) and nonlinear vacuum squeezed state (NLVSS) are used as examples of quantum state and it is shown that these states may show higher order nonclssical characteristics. It is observed that the Binomial state which is always antibunched, is not always higher order squeezed and NLVSS which shows higher order squeezing does not show HOSPS and HOA. The opposite is observed in NLESS and consequently it is established that the HOSPS and HOS are two independent signatures of higher order nonclassicalityComment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To use {{data from}} the fourth {{national}} survey of morbidity in general practice to investigate the association between home visiting rates and patients' characteristics. DESIGN [...] Survey of diagnostic data on all home visits by general practitioners. SETTING [...] 60 general practices in England and Wales. SUBJECTS [...] 502 493 patients visited at home between September 1991 and August 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Home visiting rates per 1000 patient years and home visiting ratios standardised for age and sex. RESULTS [...] 10. 1 % (139 801 / 1 378 510) of contacts with general practitioners took place in patients' homes. The average annual home visiting rate was 299 / 1000 patient years. Rates showed a J shaped relation with age and were lowest in people aged 16 - 24 years (103 / 1000) and highest in people aged > or = 85 years (3009 / 1000). 1. 3 % of patients were visited five or more times and received 39 % of visits. Age and sex standardised home visiting ratios increased from 69 (95 % confidence interval 68 to 70) in social class I to 129 (128 to 130) in social class V. The commonest diagnostic group was diseases of the respiratory system. In older age groups, diseases of the circulatory system was also a common diagnostic group. Standardised home visiting ratios for the 60 practices in the study varied nearly eightfold, from 28 to 218 (interquartile range 67 to 126). CONCLUSIONS [...] Home visits remain {{an important component of}} general practitioners' workload.
