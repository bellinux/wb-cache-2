Effects of vibration on metal forming processes can be attributed to two causes. First, the volume effect links lowering of yield stress with the influence of vibration on the dislocation movement. Second, the surface effect explains lowering of the effective coefficient of friction by periodic reduction contact area. This work is related to vibration assisted forming process in viscoplastic domain. Impact of change in vibration waveform has been analyzed. For this purpose, two analytical models have been developed for two different types of vibration waveforms (sinusoidal and triangular).

Design/methodology/approach: The incremental sheet metal forming process was performed on the CNC controlled milling machine Moiri Seiki with the FANUC MSC- 521 control system. The forming forces were measured using specially designed force measuring system which is connected with the milling machine. In contrast to force measuring, the deformations of the specimen were measured by using the graphometric analysis based on the size and direction investigation of the major strains of the particular sheet metal area. Findings: The results show that the <b>forming</b> <b>force</b> is very small in comparison to the deep drawing process and it does not depend on the product size. That is why the production of very large products is absolutely appropriate for forming. Beside this, the deformations and forces distribution are mostly dependent on the size of the wall angle of forming, tool diameter and vertical step sizes of the tool. Research limitations/implications: The deformations and forces analyses are researched only for the steel DC 05 of 1 mm in thickness.

40|$|Roll bending is an {{efficient}} metal forming technique, where plates are bent {{to a desired}} curvature using forming rolls. This type of sheet forming process {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques for manufacturing axisymmetric hollow shapes. Moreover, this process is beginning to be taken into serious consideration by industries for producing large, thick parts such as the conically shaped crown of a Francis turbine runner or of a wind turbine tower. Because of the numerous processing parameters, reducing the bending force and improving the accuracy of the final shape are significant challenges in the roll bending process. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to find the strategies for reducing <b>forming</b> <b>forces</b> and improving final part quality by employing numerical and experimental methods. In this thesis, a 3 D dynamic Finite Element (FE) model of an asymmetrical roll bending process is developed using the Ansys/LS-Dyna software. The simulation results are then compared with experiments performed with instrumented parts and roll bending machine. The parameters that affect the accuracy of the final shape, the bending forces and the residual strain left in the formed plate have been investigated. Applying this 3 D dynamic FE model in an industrial context may predict the <b>forming</b> <b>forces</b> or the accuracy of the final shapeâ€™s radius and thus will decrease the setup time before manufacturing. The <b>forming</b> <b>forces</b> can be reduced by heating the plate. In this research, the relationships between the heating plate temperature and the output parameters of roll bending process such as applied forces and final shape quality have been studied by performing FE simulation and analytical computations. These results yield to a better understanding of the mechanism of the process and provide an opportunity for the design of {{an efficient}} heating system to control the heat energy to be input in the plate during the roll bending process. This research also proposes a new, simple approach for reducing flat areas and <b>forming</b> <b>forces.</b> This approach includes moving the bottom roll slightly along the feeding direction and adjusting the bottom roll location. The FE results indicate that this new approach effectively minimizes the flat area extents and reduces also the <b>forming</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
