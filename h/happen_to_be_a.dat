500|$|In {{contrast}} with the creative equality he enjoyed with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock, Harrison returned to the Beatles fold and found the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the White Album sessions in 1968. Early on during the Get Back rehearsals – and tellingly, music journalist John Harris notes, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his partner Yoko Ono – Harrison enthused with fellow Beatles Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney about the Band's camaraderie and group ethos, saying: [...] "They're just living, and they <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> band as well." ...|$|E

"The Next Messiah", a nine-minute [...] "ode to Barbra Streisand and the devil," [...] was [...] "tracked {{completely}} live, {{with all}} the transitions, and it's {{the most exciting thing}} I've ever been involved with in the studio. I wish the rest of the record had been more like that." [...] The song is [...] "actually three different songs that Johnathan Rice and myself wrote together," [...] according to Lewis. [...] "I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Barbra Streisand fan, and Barbra Streisand fancies a medley, so we discussed stringing the three songs together." ...|$|E

500|$|Underoath's {{members are}} Christian and {{have stated that}} they are a Christian band. However, as vocalist Spencer Chamberlain explains, [...] " [...] in a {{different}} way. We're not like your average Christian band." [...] He explains that Christianity is the [...] "backbone of our lives, especially in the way that we handle certain things, but it's not so much the backbone of our lyrics. It's not like every song is a lesson from the Bible or something. It's just normal life struggles." [...] Keyboardist Christopher Dudley stated that a majority of Underoath's audience is not Christian, nor are the bands with whom they would often tour. Though the band has been noted for [...] "setting precedent in both Christian rock and beyond", only a portion of their albums are sold in the Christian marketplace. Chamberlain said, [...] "I look at us as just another band in the secular market like with all these other hardcore bands and we just <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Christian band that has different beliefs." [...] However, in an interview with Alternative Press, Drummer Aaron Gillespie stated that [...] "I'm definitely a Christian, but I don't think Underoath should be a 'Christian band'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E

Look at the bailout of Wall Street. Why not the bailout of Main Street?

[...] In a CBS 60 Minutes II segment, a spokesman for the defendants' families charges that the boys were punished not for what they did, but for who was killed. [...] The spokesman says, [...] "It's about a police officer's son who died. [...] And the only way they could convict all these kids was use the felony murder rule." [...] James Farris Sr., the victim's father, says [...] "The fact that I'm a policeman {{has nothing to do with}} anything. I just <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> policeman whose son was murdered. That's it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world....

Well, you can look {{it up in a}} book I’m {{going to tell you about}} that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{production}} of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was [...] "amazed" [...] by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a [...] "buffoon". He felt that the character had gotten [...] "progressively braver" [...] throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying [...] "how they love this guy now". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she [...] "likes to keep her life separate" [...] and [...] "wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey [...] "earns his spot on board the TARDIS". Clarke stated that he didn't {{want to focus on}} his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating [...] "the fact that I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.|$|E
