As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more {{force is applied to}} the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite.

After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven <b>heating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the disc to return.|$|E

Thermocouples can be placed either as side entry (one that enters {{the center of the}} cube from and edge) or can be a top entry thermocouple (one that enters the top face). In the case of the top entry thermocouple, it can be simultaneously be used as the top piston, but the temperature is being read far from the sample center. The side entry thermocouple reads the temperature closer to the sample center, but the placement usually involves a hole to be drilled {{in the middle of the}} furnace, altering the <b>heating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the furnace. To avoid both downside associated with wither thermocouple some sample assemblies do not use a thermocouple; temperature is instead either calibrated from the relationship of watts vs. temperature or calculated using the known pressure and calculated sample volume from in-situ x-ray diffraction data.|$|E

It is desirable to develop an applicator with the potential for heating a limited region, but achieving this objective is impossible with present technology. Therefore, our goal is to develop an applicator that can uniformly heat to deep regions of the human body. In this paper, we describe fundamental <b>heating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of an RF hyperthermic system using a rectangular resonant cavity applicator for deep-seated tumors. First, electromagnetic and heat-transfer equations were solved to investigate fundamental <b>heating</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the resonant cavity applicator.

In comparisons of the measured and calculated results, the tendencies of both heat distributions were in accordance.
