40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the influence of tree age on the assimilates partitioning and its significance for the <b>formation</b> of <b>heartwood</b> extractives in Robinia pseudoacacia L. (black locust). Assimilate translocation in 6 - and 15 -year-old plants was measured in May and August 2006 using the 14 CO 2 feeding method. The heartwood extractives content in the sapwood-heartwood transition zone and in individual tree rings of the pure heartwood were analysed by HPLC-chromatography. All plants, buds and young leaves showed the strongest 14 C specific activity compared to other plant parts in May and August(14 C specific activity in buds/leaves of 6 -years old plants: 35. 2 - 37. 0 %, 15 -years old plants: 31. 4 - 32. 2 %). However, in plants labelled in August 2006 at the sapwood-heartwood transition zone also showed a strong assimilates sink, while only small amounts of assimilates were translocated to the sapwood-heartwood transition zone in the plants labelled in May 2006. The amount of assimilates transported to the sapwood-heartwood transition zone was significantly higher in the 15 -year-old plants compared to the 6 -year-old plants. This was monitored by a higher content of extractives in the heartwood formed by the older plants compared to heartwood formed by the younger plants. The results indicate that uneven assimilate partitioning in younger and older black locust plants affects the <b>heartwood</b> extractives <b>formation,</b> which {{might lead to a}} lower natural durability of the heartwood formed by younger trees compared to heartwood formed by older trees...|$|R

30|$|<b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is {{a unique}} feature of woody plants. Heartwood is {{important}} both for a tree’s life and wood usage. The roles of heartwood {{are considered to be}} optimizing sapwood volumes, recycling nutrients, and providing mechanical support with durability [1, 2]. For the usage of wood, heartwood has positive or negative effect on wood properties due to the presence of extractives [3]. To utilize trees more efficiently as wood sources, it is crucial to understand the mechanism of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> toward regulation of the formation. <b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> has been studied from anatomical, chemical and biochemical perspectives [3 – 5]. However, why and how heartwood is formed remains largely elusive. It has been proposed that <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is an actively regulated physiological process [3, 5 – 7] and it is regarded as the final stage of wood differentiation [8]. The early stage is mature xylem formation, which includes cell division from vascular cambium, cell expansion, cell wall thickening and lignifications [1]. For this stage, expressed genes were collected and changes in gene expression were investigated on a large scale for several tree species belonging to Pinus [9 – 12], Populus [13 – 16], Eucalyptus [17 – 20] and Acacia [21]. In contrast, there have been only a few large-scale gene analyses for <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> Studies have been conducted on broad-leaved trees, Robinia pseudoacacia [22, 23] and Juglans nigra [24, 25], but there have been no reports on conifers. The sugi tree (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) has sharply defined heartwood, and usually also a readily recognized transition zone (TZ) between sapwood and heartwood [26]. Thus, C. japonica is a good sample material to study events having occurred during <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> To obtain clues to elucidate the mechanism of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> at a molecular level, we collected expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the TZ in November, in which <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is considered to proceed. The ESTs were assembled and the resulting sequences were functionally categorized. Furthermore, the expression of genes selected as having potential involvement in <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> was quantified in various organs.|$|E
30|$|Physiological changes between sapwood and {{heartwood}} were visualised in parenchyma cells. Labelling of cell organelles was challenging due to unspecific binding {{and high}} background signals.

30|$|<b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> in {{temperate}} zone trees {{results from}} the death of xylem parenchyma cells {{that is associated with}} the annual life cycle of the tree. The death of xylem parenchyma cells progresses from the inner toward the outer region of the stem. Therefore, the death of xylem parenchyma cells might be expected to begin in the tissues at the center of branches and stems, where the pith, consisting of parenchyma cells, is located [6]. If this hypothesis is correct, the parenchyma cells in the pith might be involved in the initiation of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> However, the site of initiation of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> remains to be identified.|$|E

30|$|Okada et al. [21] {{reported}} that abrupt changes {{were observed in}} metal element concentrations near the sapwood–heartwood boundary, although most elements were evenly distributed in the heartwood. They also concluded that physiological processes, such as <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation,</b> might exert an important influence {{on the distribution of}} trace elements under ordinary growing conditions. Therefore, the diffusion of 137 Cs and K within heartwood might be related to physiological changes related to <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as a form of}} programmed cell death (PCD) [7, 8]. A key factor in PCD is proteases [61]. PCD in animal cells are known to be executed by caspases, which belong to a class of specific cysteine proteases. In plants, functionally similar proteases, including papain-type cysteine proteases, are involved in some cases of PCD [62, 63]. We found an EST predicted to encode a papain-type cysteine protease. The predicted protease showed significant sequence similarity to those isolated from the leaves and petals undergoing PCD during senescence [64 – 67], suggesting that the protease may be involved in PCD in the TZ as <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is thought to be a senescence process. The expression level of the corresponding gene for the protease in the TZ was about 5 times higher in June than that in November (Fig.  2 m). Taking into consideration this expression pattern and a lack of putative norlignan biosynthetic genes, the gene expression associated with <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> might be initiated before the onset of cytological changes observed in late summer [32], and the expression of genes for enzymes related to <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> ceased in November.|$|E

It {{has been shown in}} this study {{that it is possible to}} use microscopy with appropriate staining to study physiological processes during <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> However, autofluorescence and unspecific staining made the use of several common staining techniques impractical. Investigating <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> will aid the development of a hardwood industry based on E. bosistoana, which needs to ensure consistent wood properties. Early selections for heartwood in breeding programmes (Li et al., 2018) rely on the correct identification of fully developed heartwood (Mishra et al., 2018).

40|$|Heartwood is the dead, inner {{layers of}} {{wood in the}} tree which no longer {{transport}} water. It is usually dark in colour and has increased decay-resistance compared to the sapwood. Heartwood forms in the transition zone when the ray cells die and deposit chemical extractives in the surrounding xylem. These chemicals convey natural durability which is of value to the forest and timber industry. Despite its value the formation of heartwood is poorly understood. The objective of this PhD is to improve our understanding of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> in Sitka spruce and Scots pine, the most widely planted species in Britain. Separating heartwood and sapwood at the sawmill can increase timber value {{due to differences in}} wood properties. The amount of heartwood varies both with height within, and between trees. Empirical models were developed to describe heartwood and sapwood distribution by diameter, area and ring number 1) within any wood disc 2) with height in the standing tree using taper functions, and 3) its variation between trees. Models will be incorporated into wood quality models to optimise heartwood utilisation. According to pipe theory a certain area of sapwood sustains a volume of canopy, with redundant sapwood converted to heartwood. Sap flux was examined across the sapwood and transition zone in Sitka spruce to understand water transport in relation to <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> and identify seasonal change in transport in the transition zone. Results suggest that the transition zone ceases water transport around dormancy and the amount of heartwood formed may be driven by new wood formation, maintaining sapwood depth. <b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is a seasonal process, however this has not been confirmed in Sitka spruce or Scots pine, or under UK climatic conditions. Seasonal variation in carbon dioxide and ethylene production by the transition zone were measured to identify the time of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation,</b> which was late summer through dormancy, consistent with published literature. The role of ethylene in <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is confirmed. <b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is an active developmental process, a form of programmed cell death, and as such must be carefully regulated temporally and spatially. Regulation by phytohormones has been proposed but not confirmed. Screening for a broad range of phytohormones during the proposed season of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> identified an increase in abscisic acid and a decrease in auxin concentration in the transition zone. Abscisic acid, auxin and ethylene also regulate xylogenesis, therefore the same signals that initiate cambial dormancy may also provide the temporal regulation of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> The results of this PhD will optimise the use of heartwood in Sitka spruce and Scots pine in the UK and contribute towards selective tree breeding for increased heartwood volume worldwide.

40|$|The {{greatest}} {{difference between}} trees and grasses is that grasses show only elongation growth whereas trees show both elongation and thickening growth.

30|$|When {{and how is}} K {{accumulated}} in heartwood of Japanese cedar? Rb injection in present and previous [4] experiments suggests that while moving up in sapwood, K is transferred gradually and continuously to heartwood both in the growing and resting periods. The process of radial movement of K inferred {{from the results of}} Rb injection experiment is likely to be (1) active transport via ray parenchyma from sapwood to heartwood, and (2) diffusion in heartwood. Although the relocation seems to be closely related with <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation,</b> its timing is different from cytological changes of ray parenchyma accompanying <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E

30|$|<b>Heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> is {{a genetically}} and metabolically {{controlled}} {{programmed cell death}} process, {{which leads to the}} formation of heartwood extractives (Magel et al., 2001).

The extractives formed by the living parenchyma cells in the transition zone are released and deposited in the neighbouring cells, imparting durability and colour in some species. It is postulated that <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> regulates the amount and function of sapwood, controlling water transport and storage of reserve materials (Spicer, 2005).

Results showed that only about 17 % (1, 253 vs. 7 K) of the probes in the microarray hybridized with genes from black walnut. Most of the genes that hybridized were unclassified or “no hits” but some, such as the orthologs of At 2 g 14900 and At 3 g 04710, were putatively related to cell rescue and defense.

40|$|Abstract The {{value of}} black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) is {{affected}} by {{the quality and quantity of}} darkly colored heartwood in its stem. We are exploring the regulation of heartwood production by identifying genes associated with the transition from sapwood to heartwood. Previous microarray data indicated that <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> may be related to programmed cell death (PCD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the region of <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> in walnut stems (i. e., the transition zone, TZ) for the expression of 80 ESTs putatively associated with PCD. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR was per-formed to detect the expression changes in candidate genes in the TZ and sapwood of trees harvested in summer and fall. The results revealed that the transcript of a clone that encodes a presumed homeobox protein knotted- 1 -like 3 (KNAT 3) was highly expressed in the TZ when compared with other tissues. Analysis of the full-length coding sequence revealed that the black walnut gene contains regions with 67 % similarity to Knox 1 and Knox 2 domains from the Arabidopsis thaliana KNAT 3, as well as a putative homeodomain known to be a transcription factor in other plants. JnKNAT 3 -like transcript was detected in the pith meristem, roots, embryogenic callus, vascular cambium, female flowers, male flowers, green leaves, and partially and fully senescent leaves of black walnut, although tran-script abundance varied considerably among tissues.

40|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of a}} log, sapwood and heartwood, have {{different}} properties. With regard to utilization in the wood industry, the latter is of great importance because of its higher durability and better mechanical properties. In case of wood species with colored heartwood, this fact is considered through {{the removal of the}} sapwood. This is especially true for oak, {{which is one of the}} most valuable dominant hardwood species in Hungary that prefers full sunlight and has a wide range of utilization. More than one third of the domestic wood volume consists of oak species. The <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> process of oak – just like in any other wood species – is influenced by many factors. Perhaps the most important is the genetic features of the tree, namely the wood species. There are several external determinative factors, however, like the growing conditions and ecological circumstances (geographical situation, climate, site, hydrology, etc.). Unfortunately, the effect of the circumstances is usually not taken in account despite its high importance. In terms of the quality improvement of oak stands, the examination of the relationship between heartwood-sapwood ratio and environmental factors can be a new approa ch. Increasing heartwood ratio, among numerous other benefits, primarily results in economic asset, therefore the investigation of the <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> rate cannot be neglected.

30|$|Tracheary {{elements}} often differentiate {{in vitro}} as single cells or in random groups {{and do not}} form complete vascular tissue, such as wood.

In ESTs previously collected from different organs of woody plants and functionally classified using the KOG [30, 38, 39], categories “O” and “J” were ranked in the top four in terms of abundance. Thus, it appears that the translational regulation of protein synthesis is maintained in the TZ in November as well as in other organs. Meanwhile, sequences that did not match known sequences in the KOG and UniProt databases accounted for 39 % of all unique sequences. This proportion is higher than that of C. japonica male strobili (30 %) [30], suggesting that the expression of genes specific to the TZ would occur.|$|E

40|$|The radial {{trends of}} {{vibrational}} properties, {{represented by the}} specifi c dynamic modulus (E /?) and damping coeffi cient (tan ?), were investigated for three tropical rainforest hardwood species (Simarouba amara, Carapa procera, and Symphonia globulifera) using free-free fl exural vibration tests. The microfi bril angle (MFA) was estimated using X-ray diffraction. Consistent patterns of radial variations were observed for all studied properties. E /? was found to decrease from pith to bark, which was strongly related to the increasing pith-bark trend of MFA. The variation of tan ? along the radius could be partly explained by MFA and partly by the gradient of extractives due to <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation.</b> The coupling effect of MFA and extractives could be separated through analysis of the log(tan ?) versus log(E /?) diagram. For the species studied, the extractive content putatively associated with <b>heartwood</b> <b>formation</b> generally tends to decrease the wood damping coeffi cient. However, this weakening effect of extractives was not observed for the inner part of the heartwood, suggesting that the mechanical action of extractives was reduced during their chemical ageing.
