5|$|Following {{issues with}} his make-up {{throughout}} the first season, Michael Dorn's Klingon prosthetics were modified. Michael Westmore made the <b>headpiece</b> simpler, and Dorn took to wearing a headband under the <b>headpiece</b> to reduce a skin rash on his forehead. The <b>headpiece</b> was then glued down around the edges.|$|E
5|$|The agents authorize Jones {{to recover}} the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the <b>headpiece</b> is in the {{possession}} of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the <b>headpiece,</b> and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the <b>headpiece,</b> but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the <b>headpiece</b> ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot <b>headpiece,</b> and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the <b>headpiece,</b> and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.|$|E
5|$|Further in Skáldskaparmál, Snorri relates a story where Loki {{cuts off}} Sif's hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he {{grabs hold of}} Loki, {{resulting}} in Loki swearing to have a <b>headpiece</b> made of gold to replace Sif's locks. Loki fulfills this promise by having a <b>headpiece</b> made by dwarfs, the Sons of Ivaldi. Along with the <b>headpiece,</b> the dwarfs produced Odin's spear, Gungnir. As the story progresses, the incident leads {{to the creation of}} the ship Skíðblaðnir and the boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the multiplying ring Draupnir for Odin, and the mighty hammer Mjöllnir for Thor.|$|E

5|$|In the Prose Edda, Sif {{is named}} {{as the mother}} of the goddess Þrúðr by Thor and of Ullr with a father whose name is not recorded. The Prose Edda also recounts that Sif once had her hair shorn by Loki, and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden <b>headpiece</b> made for Sif, {{resulting}} in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five other objects for other gods.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her <b>headpiece</b> is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E

50|$|Horned helmets {{were worn}} {{by many people}} around the world, but not, {{contrary}} to the modern myth, the Vikings. <b>Headpieces</b> mounted with animal horns or replicas were also worn, as in the Mesolithic Star Carr. These were probably used for religious ceremonial or ritual purposes. Much of the evidence for these helmets and <b>headpieces</b> comes from depictions rather than the items themselves.|$|R

5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The <b>headpiece</b> is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the <b>headpiece</b> by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a <b>headpiece.</b> Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{travels to}} Cairo, where they {{meet up with}} Indy's friend Sallah, a skilled excavator. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with {{a replica of the}} <b>headpiece</b> (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi <b>headpiece</b> is {{incomplete}} and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Indy and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Indy discovers Marion is alive, bound and gagged in a tent, but does not release her for fear of alerting the Nazis. Indy, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive, seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the <b>headpiece</b> of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the {{symbolic}} meaning of the helmet's design. The griffin was the companion of Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and fate. They were both seen as agents of death and were often linked with gladiatorial combat. The meaning of the face and <b>headpiece</b> are less clearly identifiable. Suggestions have ranged from the Greek god Attis and the hero Perseus, to the Roman gods Mithras and Jupiter Dolichenus, to a more general Eastern Mediterranean appearance that could possibly have been meant to suggest a Trojan identity. The Phrygian cap was often used by the Romans as a visual motif representing the Trojans.|$|E
5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard and a number of tentacles attached to the dress as well as a <b>headpiece</b> with two tentacles from it.|$|E

5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise {{that he had}} found a Roman artefact and thought at first that it was a Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the <b>headpiece,</b> visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E
