25|$|Lightning {{protection}} for aircraft {{is provided by}} mounting devices on the aircraft structure. The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an <b>electrical</b> <b>path</b> having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E

50|$|Dielectric unions, with {{dielectric}} insulation, separate dissimilar metals (such as {{copper and}} galvanized steel) to prevent galvanic corrosion. When two dissimilar metals are {{in contact with}} an electrically conductive solution (ordinary tap water is conductive), they form an electrochemical couple which generates a voltage by electrolysis. When the metals are {{in direct contact with}} each other, the electric current {{from one to the other}} also moves metallic ions from one to the other; this dissolves one metal, depositing it on the other. A dielectric union breaks the <b>electrical</b> <b>path</b> with a plastic liner between its halves, limiting galvanic corrosion.|$|E

50|$|The Enigma {{machines}} {{produced a}} polyalphabetic substitution cipher. During World War I, inventors {{in several countries}} realized that a purely random key sequence, containing no repetitive pattern, would, in principle, make a polyalphabetic substitution cipher unbreakable.

40|$|The ac {{electrical}} {{response is}} studied in thin films composed of well-defined nanometric Co particles embedded in an insulating ZrO 2 matrix {{which tends to}} coat them, preventing the formation of aggregates. In the dielectric regime, ac transport originates from the competition between interparticle capacitive Cp and tunneling Rt channels, the latter being thermally assisted. This competition yields an absorption phenomenon at a characteristic frequency 1 /(RtCp), which is observed in the range 1010 000 Hz. In this way, the effective ac properties mimic the universal response of disordered dielectric materials.

5000|$|In complex, {{multiple}} channel systems, where the fault/s {{might be in}} an interconnection, the ideal method of finding an intermittent fault {{is to be able}} to monitor, detect and isolate all channels or <b>electrical</b> <b>paths</b> continuously and simultaneously. This methodology allows the system under test to benefit from continuous and complete test coverage while any environmental stressing of the system is performed. This type cannot be performed by scanning testing technology but needs to have some form of electronic neural-network which can perform these test without the need for any scanning and/or digital averaging; this testing regime is covered by the DoD's MIL-PRF-32516 published in March 2015 and it calls for testing technology to operate in the Class 1 category in order to combat intermittent faults effectively.|$|R
50|$|Clinically speaking, {{the blocks}} {{tend to have}} more serious {{potential}} the closer they are to the 'end' of the <b>electrical</b> <b>path</b> (the muscles of the heart regulated by the heartbeat), and less serious effects the closer they are to the 'start' (at the SA node), because the potential disruption becomes greater as more of the 'path' is 'blocked' from its 'end' point. Therefore, most of the important heart blocks are AV nodal blocks and infra-Hisian blocks. SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40 - 60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals.|$|E
50|$|The {{repeated}} {{changes of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>path</b> through an Enigma scrambler implemented a {{polyalphabetic substitution cipher}} that provided Enigma's security. The diagram on the right shows how the electrical pathway changed with each key depression, which caused rotation of at least the right-hand rotor. Current passed into the set of rotors, into and {{back out of the}} reflector, and out through the rotors again. The greyed-out lines are other possible paths within each rotor; these are hard-wired from one side of each rotor to the other. The letter A encrypts differently with consecutive key presses, first to G, and then to C. This is because the right-hand rotor has stepped, sending the signal on a completely different route. Eventually other rotors step with a key press.|$|E
50|$|Electrically {{connecting}} the failing pin to a ground pin produced the electric current path {{shown in figure}} 2. This <b>electrical</b> <b>path</b> strongly suggests that the current is somehow flowing through all the ground nets though a conductive path located {{very close to the}} wirebond pads from the top down view of the package. Based on electrical and layout analysis of the package, it can be inferred that current is either flowing through the wirebond pads or that the wirebonds are somehow touching a conductive structure at the specified location. After obtaining similar SSM results on the two units under test, further destructive analysis focused around the small potential short region, and it showed that the failing pin wirebond is touching the bottom of one of the stacked dice at the specific XY position highlighted by SSM analysis. The cross section view of one of those units is shown in figure 3.|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} technology roadmap for semiconductors (ITRS) 2012 report foresees {{the use of}} {{porous dielectric}} materials with a low dielectric constant in conjunction with copper interconnects {{as a way to}} reduce the resistive-capacitive (RC) delay in microelectronic applications. However, the introduction of pores in the dielectric not only serves as stress raisers but also diminishes the structural strength of the material. The challenge therefore with the implementation of low-k dielectrics for high-performance flip-chip packages is to create a reliable die to organic substrate interconnect solution which induces low stresses on the die to prevent the cohesive cracking and the interfacial delamination of the dielectric material. Potential interconnect solutions that meet this challenge are MEMS-like compliant freestanding micro-structures. These structures are designed to work as spring-like elements which allow the free lateral and out-of-plane motion between the silicon die and the organic substrate under assembly conditions as well as under thermal or power cycling. Thus, the focus of this research is to design, fabricate, and characterize electrically and mechanically an innovative compliant interconnect approach that addresses these challenges. The proposed interconnect is scalable in dimensions and pitch, and consists multiple <b>electrical</b> <b>paths</b> which will provide redundancy against interconnect failure. The multi-path design employs parallel <b>electrical</b> <b>paths</b> which effectively split a larger cross-sectional area into several smaller areas making the overall design more compliant than otherwise. This research proposes wafer-level, high-yield, CMOS-compatible fabrication procedure using sequential photolithography and copper electroplating. The proposed interconnects are symmetric and are amenable to easy reflow assembly to substrates. The mechanical compliance of the fabricated structures is studied through nano-indentation, while the electrical characteristics are assessed through fabricated prototypes. The xvi thermo-mechanical reliability of compliant interconnects is also demonstrated. Lastly, the dimensional scalability of the interconnects is also demonstrated. Ph. D...|$|R
