50|$|The <b>E.161</b> layout is {{primarily}} {{based on the}} layout used on American telephones since the 1930s for telephone exchange names. Until the 1990s, Q and Z {{were not included in}} the standard layout, and since the letters served mainly as mnemonic devices, they were not necessary (Q and Z were not used in phonewords); telephones either omitted them, placed Q and Z onto the 1 key, or included Q and Z on the current locations, with PRS on 7 and with WXY on 9, respectively. The development of text messaging on mobile phones, which required the full range of the alphabet, led to the need to standardize locations for Q and Z on mobile devices. <b>E.161</b> adopted the current layout in response to this.|$|R
50|$|There {{had been}} some {{interest}} in using part of this country's numbering scheme to run international SMS promotions or competitions, as when +CNN is spelt out on an <b>E.161</b> standard telephone keypad, it translates to +266.

5000|$|All PIN entry devices shall allow {{entry of}} the digits zero to nine. Numeric keys {{may also have}} letters printed on them, e.g. as per <b>E.161.</b> These letters are only for the customers' convenience; internally, the PIN entry device only handles digits. (E.g. the {{standard}} does not support multi-tap or similar.) The standard also recommends that customers should be warned that not all devices may have letters.|$|R
5000|$|Many dials {{on modern}} {{telephones}} {{in use in}} the NANP service areas maintain the tradition of alphabetic dialing. Usually each pushbutton from digit 2 to 9 also displays three letters, which is standardized in ISO 9995-8 and, in Europe, <b>E.161.</b> Historically, the letters Q and Z were omitted, although some modern telephones contain them. SMS-capable devices have all 26 letters. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|A keypad {{is a set}} {{of buttons}} {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad. Numeric keypads are found on alphanumeric keyboards and on other devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, push-button telephones, vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the <b>E.161</b> standard for their arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Letters did not re-appear on {{phones in}} Europe until the {{introduction}} of mobile phones, and the layout followed the new international standard ITU E.161/ISO 9995-8. The ITU established an international standard (ITU <b>E.161)</b> in the mid-1990s, {{and that should be}} the layout used for any new devices. There is a standard, ETSI ES 202 130, that covers European languages and other languages used in Europe, published by the independent ETSI organisation in 2003 and updated in 2007. [...] Work describing some principles of the standard is available.|$|R
