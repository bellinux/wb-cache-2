Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through {{for example the}} Dominicans Francisco de Vitoria (particularly noteworthy {{for his work in}} natural law theory), Domingo de Soto (notable for his work on economic theory), John of St. Thomas, and Domingo Báñez; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the Salmanticenses); and even, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Jesuits, particularly Francisco Suárez, and Luis de Molina.|$|E

Upon touchdown, the captain misused the reverse thrusters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> No. 1 engine failed to provide reverse thrust. Coupled with the fact the captain was confused with crosswind conditions and the first officer was preoccupied and {{not paying attention to}} the landing, the 747 failed to stop {{before the end of the}} runway. The aircraft swerved to the right and slid into a ditch at 50 knots with the fuselage splitting up.|$|E

Among other influences, the last minute inclusion of a decree on sacred images was a French initiative, and the text, never discussed {{on the floor of}} the council or referred to council theologians, was based on a French draft.|$|E

And, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> little boy who is the conduit, who is also perhaps touched by the aliens, is essentially Mulder. These little touches the fans seem to respond to.

500|$|The {{sense that}} Anarky is {{appreciated}} by certain fans is one shared by Alan Grant, who {{noted that the}} character's stories routinely generated more reader mail than any other he wrote. Commenting on {{the popularity of the}} Anarky series, Grant acknowledged the failure of the series, but pointed out that it was very popular among some readers: [...] "It wasn't terribly popular in the States, although I received quite a few letters (especially from philosophy students) saying the comic had changed their entire mindset. But Anarky was very popular in South America, where people have had a long and painful taste of totalitarianism, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> US is just entering." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that [...] "everything had to be 'over the top this time around so as to distinguish Saints Row: The Third from other open world titles and to make the franchise into a AAA title. The team increased playtesting to check for the action's pacing and [...] "setpiece moments" [...] within its overall flow. Producer Greg Donovan considered Saints Row: The Third a reboot of the franchise, [...] "cohesive" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> prior two [...] "semi-serious" [...] entries were not. Other than [...] "over the top" [...] themes, the team wanted [...] "holy shit" [...] "water cooler moments" [...] that players would remember forever and want to share.

500|$|The first {{third of}} the novel {{provides}} a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: [...] "Ici se termine, en quelque sorte, l'introduction de cette histoire."

At {{the start of the}} novel, Adeline Hulot– wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot– is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named Célestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the hand of the singer Josépha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine. Mme. Hulot resists Crevel's advances, and he turns his attention elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} by Fox in July 2013 to premiere {{in the fall}} of 2014. In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is [...] "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other." [...] The Simpsons creator Groening added, [...] "In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out".|$|E
500|$|Just {{like his}} comic book counterpart, Smallvilles Clark Kent was a {{symbolic}} representation of Jesus Christ. Established early on, the pilot episode contained {{a moment when}} Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, [...] "Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?" [...] Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: [...] "Superman is, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all {{for the greater good}} of humanity, and Smallville shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role." ...|$|E

So they resonated with me <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

500|$|Aside from this, however, Madonna {{also wanted}} to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. In such a way, she decided to work with several European {{producers}} and composers within the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his [...] "very European sensibility". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, sessions started {{taking place in the}} Chappell Studios of Encino, California. Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna's album, and wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious". Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, felt that the album's title was a pun; [...] " [...] is referring to (possible erotic) stories told at bedtime (in bed). <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> (<b>the</b> album) is really a book of stories you can tell your kids at bedtime [...] sexuality explained to children [...] Madonna has always thought that children should be better informed in that aspect".|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> more violent they are, the less you want them in your community." ...|$|E

Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic {{to get out of}} her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, [...] "Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode". She elaborated by praising Olivia's [...] "B story" [...] about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of [...] "cold-blooded" [...] villains, and believed [...] "the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel like the end of a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale." ...|$|E
