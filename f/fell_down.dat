5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, <b>fell</b> <b>down</b> and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some of his contemporaries considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E

30|$|A {{damaged tree}} was <b>felled</b> <b>down,</b> logged, and sliced into ca. 30  mm-length discs. The {{stiffness}} of the degraded part and the co-existing non-degraded {{part in the}} disk was measured with the wood decay tester, Pilodyn 6 J Standard (Proceq Co., Ltd., Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). The maximal inserted spring length of the Pilodyn, which indicates minimal stiffness of wood decay, is 40  mm; lower lengths indicate greater stiffness of damage. The measurements were done in the horizontal (arrow in Fig.  1 I) and vertical (arrowhead in Fig.  1 I) directions.|$|R
