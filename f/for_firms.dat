Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

25|$|Overall, in 2007, 33% of {{employers}} gave employees the day off, a 2% {{increase over the}} previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers. The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence {{just two weeks after}} the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a floating or movable holiday.|$|E

25|$|According to a European Commission working paper, {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at least to some extent in lower current share prices. <b>For</b> <b>firms</b> which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the issue price of new shares would be lower than without the tax.|$|E

Besides its own police force, fire department, rail system, steam and power plants, and deep-water piers, workers in the terminal created their own court system as a form of self-policing.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{incremental}} effect of shareholder litigation risk on market reaction to earnings surprise warnings, that is, the warning effect.

In addition, we find negative and positive warning effects, respectively, for Jirms reporting small bad and good earnings news, suggesting that the insignijicant warning effect <b>for</b> good news <b>firms</b> is restricted to large earnings news. More importantly, we find that litigation risk magnijies the warning effect-for bad news firms, the warning effect is more negative <b>for</b> high-litigation-risk <b>firms</b> than <b>for</b> low-litigation-risk <b>firms,</b> but <b>for</b> good news <b>firms,</b> the warning effect is more positive <b>for</b> high-litigation-risk <b>firms</b> than <b>for</b> low-litigation-risk <b>firms</b> 1...|$|R

25|$|As {{chief of}} the {{artillery}} department Grand Duke Sergei came under fire {{of the president of}} the Duma, Michael Rodzianko.

The grand duke was blamed for not uncovering a band of thieves and protecting the dealings of his mistress. A special commission launched an investigation on the matter and in January 1916, Grand Duke Sergei had to resign as head of the artillery department. He was then appointed Field Inspector General of Artillery at Stavka.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline of}} Broadstone Mills was {{accompanied}} by high farce. In November 1958 the company sold a number of spinning mules as scrap for just over £3,000. By agreement, the machines remained in the mill over the winter. A small number had been broken and removed by April 1959, when the government announced a compensation package <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> that agreed to scrap spinning capacity. As the title in the mules had passed to the scrapman, {{it was decided that}} the company was not entitled to compensation amounting to over £60,000, {{despite the fact that the}} machinery was still on its premises.

25|$|Despite its {{reliance}} on manufacturing, Indiana has been less affected by declines in traditional Rust Belt manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the farm}} equipment, {{construction}} equipment, and heavy electrical industries {{were not as}} profitable for Allis-Chalmers {{as they had been}} in the 1930s through 1950s. Reasonable prosperity continued in the farm equipment line, but the economics of all the industries shifted toward greater uncertainty and brittler success <b>for</b> <b>firms</b> that didn't become number one or two in a field. Allis-Chalmers was often number three or four, as Deere and International Harvester led in farm machinery, Caterpillar and Case led in construction, and Westinghouse and General Electric led in heavy electric markets. In the late 1960s, a trend of conglomeration flared, as mega-conglomerates like Ling-Temco-Vought, Gulf+Western, and White Consolidated Industries went on buying sprees. Several takeover attempts by those firms were made on Allis-Chalmers. It was during the same era and business climate that Tenneco acquired Case.|$|E
