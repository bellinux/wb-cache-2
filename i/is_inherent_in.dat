5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} text's from the school's Louguan period is called the Xishengjing (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to India and the transmission of the Daode Jing to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the Dao that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 Deagan {{introduced}} a model, the Electravibe, that dispensed with resonator tubes entirely {{and took a}} signal directly off the bars, adding a tremolo in a preamplifier. This improved the portability of the instrument as well as solving the problem of miking the bars evenly that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> all the tuned mallet instruments.|$|E
25|$|While some U.S. policymakers, {{including}} Condoleezza Rice, {{have linked}} democracy promotion to achieving peace and security, the relationship {{may not be}} so clear, some scholars maintain, given that a level of instability <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the democratization process in the short-run, even if a politically reformed Middle East in the long-term could be an asset for international security.|$|E

25|$|Biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis {{suggested}} that biological immortality in humans is an inevitable consequence of natural evolution. His theory of extreme lifespans through perpetual-equalising interventions (ELPIs) proposes {{that the ability}} to attain indefinite lifespans <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> human biology, and that there will come a time when humans will continue to develop their intelligence by living indefinitely, rather than through evolution by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Just like Nazism {{started with}} Hitler's vision, the Islamic vision is a {{caliphate}} – a society ruled by Sharia law – {{in which women}} who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism.... Violence <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> Islam – it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.|$|E
25|$|Many culture groups, {{past and}} present, did not {{or do not}} gender names strongly, so that many or all of their names are unisex. On the other hand, in many {{languages}} including most Indo-European languages (but not English), gender <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the grammar. Some countries have laws preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names. Names may have different gender connotations {{from country to country}} or language to language.|$|E

25|$|According to Mahabharata epic, the God {{of death}} {{took the form}} of a woman and resides {{on the banks of the}} river to limit {{population}} growth. Kosi resonates with the folklore of Mithila. The most important depictions of Kosi folklore are Kosi as a virgin absolutely care free and full of energy and as a frustrated wife of old hermit Richeek wandering in the Himalayas. Kosi is also invoked as the mother - 'Kosi Ma'. These images capture the contradiction that <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the Kosi River as a source of life and death, prosperity and destruction; a mother and an enchanting virgin.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} of outcomes <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> democracy, which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for {{the realization of}} their interests, being the devolution of power {{from a group of}} people to a set of rules. Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in city states such as Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.|$|E
25|$|The {{value and}} safety of deep stops {{additional}} to the decompression schedule derived from a decompression algorithm is unclear. Decompression experts {{have pointed out that}} deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, and that the addition of deep stops of any kind {{should be included in the}} hyperbaric exposure for which the decompression schedule is computed, and not added afterwards, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Deep stops performed during a dive where the decompression is calculated in real-time are simply part of a multi-level dive to the computer, and add no risk beyond that which <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the algorithm.|$|E

25|$|The {{balancing}} {{process that}} <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> reconciling the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms with Tuvaluan values or culture was considered in Teonea v Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga. In that case the High Court of Tuvalu, then subsequently the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu had {{to determine whether}} the freedoms of belief (s. 23); expression (s. 24) and assembly and association (s. 25) and the freedom from discrimination (s. 27) could be restricted when the Falekaupule (the traditional assembly of elders) of Nanumaga passed a resolution that had the effect of banning the Brethren Church from seeking converts in Nanumaga. The Falekaupule were on the view that the preaching of the Brethren Church was causing division in the Nanumaga community.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish Riksbank was the world's first central bank, {{created in}} 1668. Many nations {{followed}} suit {{in the late}} 1600s to establish central banks which were given the legal power to set the reserve requirement, and to specify the form in which such assets (called the monetary base) are required to be held. In order to mitigate the impact of bank failures and financial crises, central banks were also granted the authority to centralize banks' storage of precious metal reserves, thereby facilitating transfer of gold {{in the event of}} bank runs, to regulate commercial banks, impose reserve requirements, and to act as lender-of-last-resort if any bank faced a bank run. The emergence of central banks reduced the risk of bank runs which <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> fractional-reserve banking, and it allowed the practice to continue as it does today.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{devised the}} scene in which Rick shot and killed Dave and Tony in a bar, and {{presented}} it to Reilly. Johnson sought to authorize man's animalistic qualities during a state of disaster. Reilly contacted showrunner Glen Mazzara via cell phone, and wanted to add the scene to the episode's script. [...] "That was an incredible scene," [...] reflected Lincoln. [...] "We were so lucky to get such cracking actors. And we didn't play the problem, we just played {{the fact that this}} is a reunion of human beings. The tension <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the fact that they encounter this other group." ...|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{suppliers}} and fabricators have created crowd control barricades, {{but over the}} years, some unofficial standards have been generally accepted. These characteristics have <b>been</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the barricades offered by the leading suppliers since the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Some governments grant broad {{exclusions}} {{from all}} taxation for {{certain types of}} organization. The exclusions may be restricted to entities having various characteristics.

500|$|The Islamic {{concept of}} Taqwa {{is closely related}} to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to [...] "right conduct" [...] or [...] "piety", [...] "guarding of oneself" [...] or [...] "guarding against evil". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the {{ultimate}} source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a postdoc at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information <b>is</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E
