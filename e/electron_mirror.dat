Along the density ramp, premature wavebreaking due to thermal effects is shown to be well mitigated. Under sufficiently high amplitudes of wake excitation, overcritical dense <b>electron</b> <b>mirrors</b> can pile up when approaching {{the end of the}} up-ramp. The consequent mirror speed can be stably driven to the group velocity of the laser propagating in a corresponding uniform plasma.

40|$|Nonlinear {{electron}} {{whistler mode}} wave particle interactions {{in the near}} earth magnetosphere suggest several candidate mechanisms for phase space diffusion of electrons into the loss cone to provide a source of auroral precipitating electrons. A unidirectional whistler mode wave propagating parallel to the background magnetic field and interacting with an electron can be shown to produce resonance (trapping of electrons) but the process is not stochastic. Chaos can be introduced by resonance between <b>electrons</b> that <b>mirror</b> {{many times in the}} earth's field, and a whistler wavefield. Here, we show that an electron interacting with two oppositely directed, parallel propagating whistler mode waves exhibits stochastic behaviour in addition to resonance. The background field is uniform, so that stochasticity arises solely due to the presence of the wavefield without requiring bounce motion of <b>electrons</b> between <b>mirror</b> points. Stochasticity first appears for wave amplitudes not inconsistent with observations at disturbed times in the near earth magnetosphere and therefore may contribute to pitch angle diffusion...|$|R

The objective in this setting is to measure the phase shift of the probe electron wave to a precision Δθ within the number of electrons N that does not destroy the specimen. In conventional electron microscopy Δθ scales as ∼ 1 /N^ 1 / 2, which falls short of the Heisenberg limit ∼ 1 /N.

40|$|A new {{high-resolution}} aberration corrected photoemission {{electron microscope}} (PEEM 3) will be installed on an undulator beam {{line at the}} Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The aim of this instrument {{is to provide a}} substantial flux and resolution improvement by employing an <b>electron</b> <b>mirror</b> for correcting both the third-order spherical aberration and the primary chromatic aberration. In order to utilize this concept of correction, a beam separator is a prerequisite. Crucial to achieving a resolution of 5 nm for the high resolution mode, and a sixteen-fold increase in throughput at the same resolution as its predecessor, PEEM 2, specified as 20 nm at 2 % transmission, for the high flux mode is the double symmetric design of the beam separator, which eliminates all the second order geometric aberrations. Nonetheless, substantial tuning capabilities must be incorporated into the PEEM 3 design to compensate for both systematic and random errors. In this paper, we investigate how to correct for non-systematic imperfections and for systematic uncertainties in the accuracy of the magnetic fields and focus on how degradation of the resolution and the field of view can be minimized.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{hyperbolic}} electrostatic <b>electron</b> <b>mirror</b> is presented. The focal properties of the mirror are determined both theoretically and experimentally. In the theoretical study the mirror field is formed between a positive hyperbolic potential surface and the negative asymptotic cone of half angle arctan 1 : 2 [square root of 2]. The focal properties are obtained from the solutions of the equations for the radial and axial motions of the electron in the mirror field. The analysis includes the effect of an axial aperture (for entrance and exit of electrons) in the positive surface. The paraxial values of focal length arid focal distance and their second order spherical aberrations are calculated by expanding the expressions for the focal properties {{in terms of the}} incident radial height. The mirror field in the experimental study is formed between a similar negative electrode and a flat apertured positive electrode. The experimental values of the focal properties are determined by a ray tracing method in which the pattern of shadows cast by a grid in the incident and reflected beams is analyzed. Comparison of the experimentally measured and the theoretically calculated focal properties shows satisfactory agreement.

This thesis investigates the generation of a relativistic <b>electron</b> <b>mirror</b> from a nanometer foil with current state-of-the-art high intensity laser pulses and demonstrates {{for the first time the}} reflection from those structures in an experiment. To achieve this result, the electron acceleration from high intensity laser nanometer foil interactions was studied in a series of experiments using three inherently different high power laser systems and free-standing foils as thin as 3 nm. A drastic increase in the electron energies was observed when reducing the target thickness from the micrometer to the nanometer scale. Quasi-monoenergetic electron beams were measured for the first time from ultrathin (≤ 5 nm) foils, reaching energies up to 35 MeV. The acceleration process was studied in simulations well-adapted to the experiments, indicating the transition from plasma to free electron dynamics as the target thickness is reduced to the few nanometer range. The experience gained from those studies allowed proceeding to the central goal, the demonstration of the relativistically flying mirror, which was achieved at the Astra Gemini dual beam laser facility. In this experiment, a frequency shift in the backscatter signal from the visible (800 nm) to the extreme ultraviolet (60 nm) was observed when irradiating the interaction region with a counter-propagating probe pulse simultaneously. Complementary to the experimental observations, a detailed numerical study on the dual beam interaction is presented, explaining the mirror formation and reflection process in great depth, indicating a > 10 ^ 4 fold increase in the backscatter efficiency as compared to the expected incoherent signal. The simulations show that the created electron mirrors propagate freely at relativistic velocities while reflecting off the counter-propagating laser, thereby truly acting like the relativistic mirror first discussed in Einstein's thought experiment.

40|$|The time-energy {{dispersion}} (TED) {{characteristics of}} a spherical electrostatic mirror are used to design an unusual electron energy analyzer. It is shown that TED of a retarding spherical field in an <b>electron</b> <b>mirror</b> configuration is positive and it increases with the electron kinetic energy. This is due to an increasing penetration of electrons with high kinetic energy in the retarding field and provides the basis for developing {{a new type of}} time-of-flight spectrometer (TOF). Two limiting cases for the geometry of the proposed spectrometer are considered and for both of them the energy resolution of the TOF device depends on the combined time resolution of electron detector and readout electronics. In the case of a 10 -cm inner sphere radius (22 cm outer sphere radius) for the electrostatic mirror, the spectrometer is expected to have an energy resolution of about 0. 5 eV/ns and an acceptance solid angle of about 2. 2 srad for electrons of 75 eV kinetic energy. A position sensitive detector allows retrieving the energy and the emission angle {{on the basis of the}} measured time-of-flight and detection point position. In the second case the inner sphere radius is 6 cm and the outer spherical segment has a radius of 120 cm. The energy resolution is expected to be about 160 meV/ns at the electron kinetic energy of 1 keV and the acceptance solid angle is 0. 1 srad. In both cases changing the retarding potential can easily change the energy range within which the TOF analysis is performed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
