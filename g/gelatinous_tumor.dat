40|$|Myxoma {{is a rare}} mesenchymal tumor and it {{is mainly}} seen in heart and skin. Renal myxoma is {{extremely}} rare. To date, eleven cases of kidney myxomas {{have been reported in}} the literature. One of them is myxoma of the renal sinus. Our case was an 82 -year-old man admitted to our hospital symptoms related to the urinary tract obstruction. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a solid, hypodense mass 9 cm in diameter infiltrating the renal parenchyma in the renal pelvis. The patient underwent nephrectomy. The resected kidney contained <b>gelatinous</b> <b>tumor</b> with indistinct borders. The tumor was composed of slender, bland, spindle-shaped cells with large amounts of mucoid material. Tumor cells were positively stained with vimentin, focally stained positive for smooth muscle actin and had negative reactivity for S- 100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen and pancytokeratin. Herein we report the second case of renal myxoma arising from the renal sinus...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Pericardial {{synovial}} sarcoma {{is an extremely}} rare tumor with poor prognosis. Timely diagnosis and aggressive multimodal management improves patient outcome. We present our experience of diagnosis and management of a young patient with monophasic {{synovial sarcoma}} arising from pericardium. Case: A 27 -year-old man presented with dyspnea and cough of three weeks duration. Examination revealed sinus tachycardia, distant heart sounds and elevated jugular venous pressure. Chest X-ray showed widened mediastinum. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) noted large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Therapeutic pericardiocentesis yielded hemorrhagic fluid. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed persistent pericardial effusion and a left anterior mediastinal mass. Left anterior thoracotomy, pericardial window and left anterior mediastinotomy were done, revealing a well-encapsulated <b>gelatinous</b> <b>tumor</b> originating from the pericardium. Histology and immunohistochemical profile showed the tumor to be a monophasic synovial sarcoma. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was positive for SS 18 (SYT) gene rearrangement on chromosome 18 q 11, substantiating the diagnosis. Work-up for metastases was negative. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide led to substantial reduction {{in the size of}} the tumor. The patient underwent surgical resection and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) post surgery. He had symptom-free survival for 8 months prior to local recurrence. This was managed with left lung upper lobectomy and follow-up chemotherapy with docetaxel. The patient is currently stable with an acceptable functional status. Conclusion: In patients with pericardial effusions of unknown etiology, multiple modalities of cardiac imaging must be employed if there is suspicion of a pericardial mass. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful to evaluate for pericardial thickening or masses in addition to TTE. Treatment of synovial sarcoma is not well established. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment. In non-resectable tumors, aggressive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide followed by surgical resection and EBRT may lead to improved outcome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Most of gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} can {{be simply}} diagnosed by microscopic examination of biopsy specimen. Rarely the structural and cellular atypia of tumor cells is too insignificant to discriminate from benign foveolar epithelium. Case presentation A 67 -year-old male {{presented with a}} gastric mass incidentally found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) for routine medical examination. Gastric endoscopic examination revealed a huge fungating mass at the cardia and mucosal biopsy was performed. Microscopically the biopsy specimen showed proliferation of bland looking foveolar epithelia in the inflammatory background and diagnosed as foveolar epithelial hyperplasia. Because the clinical and endoscopic features of this patient were strongly suggestive of malignancy, the patient underwent radical total gastrectomy. The resected stomach revealed a huge fungating tumor at the cardia. The cut surface of the <b>tumor</b> was whitish <b>gelatinous.</b> Microscopically the <b>tumor</b> was sharply demarcated from surrounding mucosa and composed of very well formed glandular structures without significant cellular atypia, which invaded into the whole layer of the gastric wall. Tumor glands were occasionally complicated or dilated, and glandular lumina were filled with abundant mucin. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells revealed no overexpression of p 53 protein but high Ki- 67 labeling index. The tumor cells and intraluminal mucin were diffusely expressed MUC 1 and MUC 5 AC and only focally expressed MUC 2. On abdominal CT taken after 12 months demonstrated peritoneal carcinomatosis and multiple metastatic foci in the lung. Conclusion The clinicopathologic profiles of gastric extremely well differentiated adenocarcinoma of gastric phenotype include cardiac location, fungating gross type, very similar histology to foveolar epithelial hyperplasia, foveolar mucin phenotype, lack of p 53 overexpressoin and high proliferative index. </p...|$|R
