This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's <b>greeting</b> comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

40|$|This practice-based thesis {{examines}} ways {{in which}} the cultural patterning of <b>greetings</b> can be understood through their visualisation. The graphic design practice uses a range of digital tools and software to develop an animated graphic notation system for analysing nonverbal aspects of <b>greetings</b> both within and across cultures. The thesis explicates the process of this development and outlines its context and significance. Previous systems of visualisation devised by anthropologists for the study of <b>greetings</b> have stopped short of using contemporary digital technology. Further, although intercultural contact has increased, most existing <b>greetings</b> studies still focus on intracultural <b>greetings...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Greetings</b> {{involving}} {{exchanges of}} ritualized sexual gestures {{are a common}} form of interaction among adult male baboons, although relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to them. In this study, we investigate how <b>greetings</b> reflect important aspects of the male's social relationships, including dominance rank, age/residence status, and cooperative tendencies. The results are based on over 600 <b>greetings</b> among 12 adult males recorded during a 4 -month study of a troop of wild olive baboons near Gilgil, Kenya. Four of the adult males were older, lower-ranking, long-term residents, which frequently formed coalitions to take estrous females away from the eight young, higher-ranking males. Virtually all dyads greeted: <b>greetings</b> occurred more than twice as often as other types of male-male interactions; and nearly all <b>greetings</b> occurred in a neutral context, in which there was no resource at stake. The percentage of <b>greetings</b> completed, the frequency with which different gestures were employed, and the roles adopted by each male varied significantly across old-old, old-young, and young-young dyads. <b>Greetings</b> between young adult males were often interrupted or actively resisted, consistent with their unstable and ambiguous dominance relationships. <b>Greetings</b> between old-old dyads were usually completed and appeared consistent with their cooperative relationships. One pair of old males formed a stable, reciprocal coalition against young males, and this pair's <b>greetings</b> showed remarkable symmetry of roles. <b>Greetings,</b> we hypothesize, function to allow males to negotiate important aspects of their relationships, including cooperation...|$|R

5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly <b>greeting,</b> and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common <b>greeting</b> and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E
