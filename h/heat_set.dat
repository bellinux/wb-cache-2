During the winning streak, James led the Heat in defeating his former team by scoring 38 points (tying a Heat record for points in a quarter with 24 in the third) {{in a game that}} drew nearly 7.1 million viewers and earned a 25.4 rating in Miami. ESPN 3D aired its first NBA game in the third dimension on December 17, 2010 when the Heat defeated the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden., The <b>Heat</b> <b>set</b> a franchise record for wins in December with 15 and set an NBA record for consecutive road victories in a calendar month with 10 (including the Christmas Day match-up with the reigning two-time champion Los Angeles Lakers, which the team won 96–80).|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} of reborning a play doll typically involves {{a number of}} steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to {{give the appearance of}} realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> paints are used, the doll parts must be <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. [...] There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names. [...] Many feel that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time. [...] In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.|$|E
500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{associated}} with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a [...] "labyrinth" [...] or [...] "maze". Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of films noir take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of White <b>Heat,</b> <b>set</b> at a chemical plant. In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always rains.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> is a {{term used}} in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as <b>heat</b> <b>setting.</b> The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|R
50|$|The {{unprocessed}} yarn {{is provided}} on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At {{a speed of}} up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a “figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).The <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After <b>heat</b> <b>setting,</b> the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.|$|R

In the playoffs, Payton did not start but averaged 24.3 minutes a game after averaging 28.5 minutes during the regular season, often playing during pressure situations in the 4th quarter of games.

True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the 2013 NBA Playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West. Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the <b>Heat</b> <b>set</b> a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It {{was the first time the}} Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992.

50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in {{cut-pile}} carpets by all means.

In the machine design, a better airflow circulation strategy for an efficient drying is addressed. Equations for heat and mass transfer in moist porous materials and theories on thermo- and fluid-dynamics are used to support the machine design.
