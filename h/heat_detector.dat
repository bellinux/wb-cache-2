25|$|The first {{automatic}} electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton, {{an associate of}} Thomas Edison. George Andrew Darby patented the first European electrical <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> in 1902 in Birmingham, England. In the late 1930s Swiss physicist Walter Jaeger tried to invent a sensor for poison gas. He expected that gas entering the sensor would bind to ionized air molecules and thereby alter an electric current in a circuit in the instrument. His device did not meet its purpose: small concentrations of gas {{had no effect on}} the sensor's conductivity. Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette and was soon surprised to notice that a meter on the instrument had registered a drop in current. Smoke particles from his cigarette had apparently done what poison gas could not. Jaeger's experiment was one of the advances that {{paved the way for the}} modern smoke detector. In 1939 Swiss physicist Ernst Meili devised an ionization chamber device capable of detecting combustible gases in mines. He also invented a cold cathode tube that could amplify the small signal generated by the detection mechanism to a strength sufficient to activate an alarm.|$|E

The most severe fires {{generally}} start outside the building and spread up along the façade and into the attic through ventilation openings in the eaves. Linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> can be placed on façades to detect these types of fires. Such devices detect fire when short-circuited at a specific temperature. In this article, an attempt to simulate linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> is presented. Data from small-scale and full-scale experiments are compared with these simulations. The small-scale experiments and simulations demonstrate that the cable failure model in Fire Dynamics Simulator can be used to predict detection in linear <b>heat</b> <b>detectors</b> that use short-circuiting as the means of signaling an overheated condition.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the smoke {{transport}} lag time at the early stage of fires in long-narrow spaces, which {{is defined as the}} time from fire onset to the time when smoke reaches a given position on the ceiling. For a <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> at a specific location on the ceiling, the smoke transport lag time {{is a part of the}} response time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> Especially when the heat release rate is relatively small at the early stage of fires, the smoke transport lag time will be very long, which will hence lead to the increase of <b>heat</b> <b>detector</b> response time. It is clear that the prediction of smoke transport lag time is critical to the activation time of the <b>heat</b> <b>detector.</b> However, previous studies have much focused on fire characteristics in long-narrow spaces, leaving very few on the transport time lag. Therefore, in this study, a theoretical model regarding smoke transport time lag was developed for both steady and time-dependent fires based on the weak-plume theory. This model was validated by a series of reduced-scale experiments. It can be concluded from comparison that the predictions of this model agree reasonably well with the corresponding experimental results. Using the proposed method, the dimensionless equations of smoke transport time lag, velocity and temperature considering the smoke lag effect in a long-narrow space for time-squared fires were also theoretically deduced. Additionally, to further determine the applicability of &# 039;Quasi-steady&# 039; state assumption for time-squared fires, a calculation method regarding the critical time was also developed. The outcomes from this study will be beneficial to the development of fire detection model in long-narrow spaces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFire {{detector}} {{plays an}} important role in ship fire safety system. Usually, there are two types of fire detectors including fire smoke detector and <b>heat</b> <b>detector,</b> which are widely used in exit passageway, corridor, ladderway, and other long and narrow spaces in ship.

This work is to develop a new detection time calculating model based on the fire plume rules including characteristics of temperature and velocity of fire smoke distributing in long and narrow spaces. Numeric method for calculating detection time is also presented. Finally, some calculations and analysis for a given fire scenario are performed. The numeric results are compared with that of the existing detection time calculating model based on free plume theory, which demonstrate the applicability of the model proposed in this article...|$|E
