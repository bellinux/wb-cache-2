40|$|We {{introduce}} HandLog, a novel handheld interaction {{device that}} supports single handed deformation through finger flexion {{as a continuous}} digital input. It consists of a 3 D printed core inserted within a <b>foam</b> <b>sleeve</b> embedded with conductive foam columns. By measuring resistance changes across the columns during deformation, whole hand or individual finger flexion motions can be mapped to digital data in real-time. We conducted a user study that demonstrated the successful use of the device for game input and identified users could quickly become competent with the device and that its supported interactions when compared with discrete controls created a more engaging experience. There is great potential for HandLog to be applicable in other application domains, including hand exercise for rehabilitation and handheld controllers for smart homes in ubiquitous computing...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} theoretical development, design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} two remote sensing antennas. The antennas operate in Ku and Ka bands and must support multiple beams, polarizations, and frequencies with a single aperture. ^ The first antenna, developed for NASA 2 ̆ 7 s High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler, is a single, offset-fed reflector that supports dual-band beams incident at 30 ° and 40 ° off-nadir. The antenna uses two compact, dual-band feeds {{moved away from the}} reflector 2 ̆ 7 s focal point to meet the dual beam requirement. The radar is to be flown on the Global Hawk Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle which has a small payload bay requiring the feeds to be both rugged and compact. ^ The second antenna, developed for Remote Sensing Solutions 2 ̆ 7 Dual-Wavelength Precipitation Radar, is a dual-offset Gregorian reflector. The antenna supports a single, dual-band, beam with dual-polarization at each band. Additionally, the antenna has high polarization purity and matched half power beamwidths at Ku and Ka bands. The strict requirements of the antenna are met by precisely controlling feed radiation characteristics. ^ The two antennas necessitated several advances in feed design. A <b>foam</b> <b>sleeve</b> is demonstrated as an effective method to reduce the beamwidth of a tapered dielectric rod antenna. The <b>foam</b> <b>sleeve</b> is an attractive design because it allows dual-band feeds where a corrugated horn is used to control radiation at lower frequencies and the sleeve corrected rod is used to control the upper band. By judiciously choosing sleeve material, independent control of the radiation pattern and phase center at each band is achieved allowing higher performance feeds. This dissertation also focuses on new developments in the backend design of feeds. Specifically, the use of tuning arms in the feed backend and double ridged waveguide to couple the signal into the feed allow more compact designs with greater bandwidth. ...|$|E
5000|$|Long Dong Silver (born April 20, 1960), is {{a retired}} porn star. Famed for the {{apparent}} size of his penis (reputedly 24 inches / 65 centimeters), he appeared in several pornographic movies in the UK and US during the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, photographer Jay Myrdal has revealed that although Silver “was immensely endowed… a good nine or ten inches,” the penis featured in his porn shoots was faked. After at first successfully utilising “complicated multi-exposure techniques” to enhance Silver’s natural endowments for still photography, Myrdal later persuaded the makeup artist for the film The Elephant Man to create the prosthetic which greatly contributed to the notoriety of Long Dong Silver. Myrdal comments that, “It was very light, a very delicate <b>foam</b> latex <b>sleeve</b> that fit on over the cock, carefully glued down underneath by the pubes and then made up.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Alternatively, the wet/dry filter may {{be placed}} below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium. Prefiltered water is {{delivered}} to a perforated plate (drip plate). Prefiltering may {{take place in}} the aquarium via a <b>foam</b> block or <b>sleeve</b> in the overflow, or weir siphon, or it may be prefiltered by filter wool resting on the perforated plate. The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over the drip plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or [...] "Double Layer Spiral") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO2 is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.|$|R

A quasi-experimental study was conducted in Chiang Rai Province. The MEI model was designed on the basis of four core components: cognitive behavior therapy, ergonomic education training, stretching exercise, and the <b>foam</b> <b>sleeve</b> broom handle grip. Seventy-five street sweepers volunteered for the screening process on MSD of having level score ≥ 4 by physiotherapist. Face to face interviews were used mainly in order to diagnose MSD. Physical examination was performed by physiotherapist and physical performance by sports scientist. The findings showed that the MEI model among the intervention group significantly reduced MSD compared with that among control group at exit model and follow-up (P< 0. 01). This research suggests that the MEI model was appropriate to reduce MSD associated with repetitive movement and awkward postures on task.
