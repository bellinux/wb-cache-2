40|$|New {{discoveries in}} {{biotechnology}} nowadays allow us treating the so-far incurable diseases with creating <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> Although {{the use of}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> can bring us benefits, the genetic engineering still raises a lot of moral questions. Schools are not systems isolated from social problems {{that come with the}} use of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> They take a more or less neutral position towards those organisms. Teachers with their work and attitude have an important influence on the behavior of the students. In some cases teacher is the only source of information about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> That is what I decided to investigate in my diploma thesis: how knowledge and interest influence the position that students take towards the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> On the basis of questionnaire of Šorgo et al. (2011 b) we prepared a poll, which was tested in the eight and ninth grade of a primary school. Results of our survey have shown that students who have more knowledge about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> have higher interest for learning about those organisms. It has been discovered that older students have higher interest for learning about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> than younger students. Survey also showed that girls expres higher interest for learning about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organizms. We believe that the teacher with her or his attitude and with the chosen teaching methods can importantly influence the formation of student's perception of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> The perception will be based on the risk assessment of the use of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|In the 1970 and 1980s, {{scientists}} {{passed this}} hurdle by inventing procedures for combining the DNA of two vastly different species with genetic engineering. The organisms produced by these procedures were termed transgenic. Transgenesis {{is the same}} as gene therapy {{in the sense that they}} both transform cells for a specific purpose. However, they are completely different in their purposes, as gene therapy aims to cure a defect in cells, and transgenesis seeks to produce a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> by incorporating the specific transgene into every cell and changing the genome. Transgenesis will therefore change the germ cells, not only the somatic cells, in order to ensure that the transgenes are passed down to the offspring when the organisms reproduce. Transgenes alter the genome by blocking the function of a host gene; they can either replace the host gene with one that codes for a different protein, or introduce an additional gene.|$|E
25|$|The mustard Arabidopsis thaliana, {{one of the}} best-studied {{plants in}} the world, {{normally}} turns red under harsh conditions. But {{using a combination of}} natural mutations and genetic manipulation, scientists from Danish biotechnology company Aresa Biodetection, created a strain that only changes color in response to the nitrous oxide that leaks from landmines and other explosives. Because nitrous oxide can also be formed by denitrifying bacteria, there is some risk of false positives using this technique, and researchers are attempting to make the plant less sensitive. The plants would aid demining by indicating the presence of mines through color change, and could either be sown from aircraft or by people walking through demined corridors in minefields. As of February 2005, no studies have been conducted with actual landmines, though successful studies have been done in greenhouses. In order {{to prevent the spread of}} this <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> into the wild, the plants have been further modified so that they will only sprout when provided with an external growth factor.|$|E
25|$|The US has an elaborate, {{interdepartmental}} {{regulatory system}} to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 gives the USDA {{the authority to}} oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized. In 2015, Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom. Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated under by the USDA under Section 340.2. Yang's white button mushroom was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation. In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With {{the help of the}} US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play. With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the FDA has begun issuing new regulations.|$|E

40|$|The {{focal point}} of this thesis is the {{regulation}} of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> in the European Union.

Another aim of the thesis is to suggest necessary modifications of the legal framework based on the analysis.
