50|$|The Hop Aphid, or <b>Damson-hop</b> <b>aphid,</b> (Phorodon humuli), is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap.|$|E
50|$|Various Prunus {{species are}} winter hosts of the <b>Damson-hop</b> <b>aphid,</b> Phorodon humuli, which is {{destructive}} to hops Humulus lupulus {{just at the}} time of their maturity, so it is recommended that plum trees not be grown in the vicinity of hop fields.|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of dwarf hops (Humulus lupulus) by <b>damson-hop</b> <b>aphid</b> (Phorodon humuli (Schrank)) migrating from Prunus spp. was investigated at six plant spacings and {{where some of}} the hops were replaced by oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), a non-host of the aphid. The number of migrant aphids that accumulated on hop stems (bines) increased with increasing bine size and density. The numbers of aphids that colonised hops interplanted with oilseed rape reflected the density of the hop plants only and not the overall plant density. As the physical size of the wind shadow within which flying aphids can manoeuvre and land was unimportant unless provided by a host plant, the finding supports the theory that flying aphids respond to olfactory stimuli associated with their hosts. Variation in bine height (as a measure of plant size) explained 29 – 93 % of the variance in aphid counts during the 3 years' study and bine density 1 – 14 %. Standardising the data as the numbers of aphids per metre of bine and taking a square-root transformation of these standardised counts improved the precision of the analyses and, by stabilising variances, facilitated comparisons between years as growth became more vigorous as the plants matured. Each year, the rate of increase in numbers of aphids settling on plots of hops declined curvilinearly with increasing bine density. Maximum colonisation by P. humuli occurred at a bine density of five per metre row, a density similar to that used commercially by growers of dwarf hops...|$|E
