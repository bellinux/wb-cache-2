5|$|Although Kane adamantly {{refused to}} share credit {{for many of}} <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> (and refuted Robinson's claim until Kane's death), many comic historians credit Robinson with the Joker's {{creation}} and Finger with the character's development. By 2011, Finger, Kane, and Robinson had died, leaving the story unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Some have accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot {{and many of}} <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution {{despite the lack of}} originality.|$|E
5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did not reflect the dreams of <b>his</b> <b>characters.</b> Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of <b>his</b> <b>characters,</b> especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E
5|$|The Jim Henson Museum, {{located in}} Leland, Mississippi, {{features}} {{an assortment of}} original Muppet characters, official certificates from the Mississippi Legislature honoring Henson and <b>his</b> <b>characters,</b> and a statue of Kermit {{in the middle of}} the stream behind the museum.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Grant Cramer, {{who starred}} in the {{original}} film, revealed that <b>his</b> <b>character</b> would make a return as a town drunk whom nobody believes. <b>His</b> <b>character</b> {{would serve as a}} mentor to young street performers who must fight the Killer Klowns when they return. He described <b>his</b> <b>character</b> as [...] "somewhere between the energy of Kris Kristofferson's character in Blade and Christopher Lloyd's character in Back to the Future".|$|R

5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of <b>his</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} {{some readers}} to visit Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E
5|$|Fielding was {{concerned}} with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in {{the actions of the}} character Merital in Love in Several Masques in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{realized}} {{after reading}} the script for the pilot episode that <b>his</b> <b>character</b> {{was not going to}} be around for the entirety of the series. This became even clearer when <b>his</b> <b>character's</b> storylines began to develop quickly. While filming [...] "Obscura", Johnson was informed that <b>his</b> <b>character</b> would not be returning as a series regular for season two. Initially fearing that he had made some mistake and that they were going to kill <b>his</b> <b>character</b> off, Johnson learned that Whitney would be enlisting into the Marines. The actor has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.|$|R

5000|$|George Clooney {{left the}} show in the Season 5 episode [...] "The Storm, Part 2," [...] when <b>his</b> <b>character,</b> Doug Ross, quit before being fired for his {{involvement}} in a patient's death.

5|$|In {{one shot}} Guinness appears as seven of <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> at {{once in a}} single frame. This was {{accomplished}} by masking the lens. The film was re-exposed several times with Guinness in different positions over several days. Douglas Slocombe, the cinematographer {{in charge of the}} effect, recalled sleeping in the studio to make sure nobody touched the camera.|$|E
5|$|Keane {{is known}} for basing <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> on members of his family; Rapunzel's passion for art and {{painting}} {{was inspired by the}} interests of his daughter, Claire. Several of Claire's original drawings and paintings are used to decorate Rapunzel's tower. While Keane working on Tangled, Claire gave birth to his first grandchild, Matisse, whose appearance served as the animator's inspiration for the infant Rapunzel.|$|E
5|$|Kobayashi {{allowed the}} voice actors who voiced <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> {{significant}} freedom to interpret {{them as they}} chose. There {{were a number of}} cast changes throughout the production; Ami Koshimizu, the voice actress for Tenma, had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo, and between School Rumbles first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. Mako Sakurai took over Karen's role from Yuuka Nanri, and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, Gabel {{was cast}} {{for just the}} finale, and did not hear about <b>his</b> <b>character's</b> return {{until the end of}} the {{following}} summer. To date he has played four versions of <b>his</b> <b>character,</b> one in each universe and timeline. The actor was promoted to a full-time regular for the series' fourth season before departing at the end when <b>his</b> <b>character</b> remained in the alternate universe. Lee returned at the end of the fifth season, in the episode [...] "Liberty".|$|R

5|$|Light House {{intentionally}} references the satirical {{novels of}} the early 19th-century British author and satirist Thomas Love Peacock, such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey. Peacock's novels have little plot and are best known for parodying the intellectual modes and pretenses of his contemporaries; <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> normally assemble in characteristic English country houses and predominantly engage in conversation. Nightmare Abbey satirized the English romantic movement and included characters based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of <b>his</b> <b>characters,</b> particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has been}} known to allow his {{collaborative}} partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him; Kyle MacLachlan has several times persuaded Lynch to rewrite scenes, including in 1986's Blue Velvet and the television series Twin Peaks, as he felt they were not right for <b>his</b> <b>characters.</b> The following lists include all of the cast and crew members with whom Lynch has worked on three or more separate projects.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Fassbender as Burke: A bowler hat-wearing, tattooed, psychopathic Irishman and Turnbull's {{right-hand}} man.

5000|$|... by damning <b>his</b> <b>character</b> with monitory {{footnotes}} and authorial intrusions, Richardson {{was free}} to develop in his fiction his villain's fantasy world. Schemes of mass rape would be legitimate as long as Richardson emphasized the negative aspects of <b>his</b> <b>character</b> at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Santoro {{joined the}} cast of Lost as {{survivor}} of Oceanic Flight 815, Paulo.

He also voices <b>his</b> <b>character</b> Paulo in the Portuguese dub for Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of <b>his</b> <b>characters.</b> He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E
5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by <b>his</b> <b>characters,</b> focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are {{generally}} known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually {{a part of a}} different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. Sophocles influenced the development of drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed <b>his</b> <b>characters</b> {{to a greater extent than}} earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.|$|E
