50|$|Thrombin is {{produced}} by the enzymatic cleavage of two sites on prothrombin by activated Factor X (Xa). The activity of factor Xa is greatly enhanced by binding to activated Factor V (Va), termed the prothrombinase complex. Prothrombin {{is produced}} in the liver and is co-translationally modified in a vitamin K-dependent reaction that converts 10-12 glutamic acids in the N terminus of the molecule to <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gla). In the presence of calcium, the Gla residues promote the binding of prothrombin to phospholipid bilayers. Deficiency of vitamin K or administration of the anticoagulant warfarin inhibits the production of <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> residues, slowing the activation of the coagulation cascade.|$|E

The carboxylation reaction will only proceed if the carboxylase enzyme {{is able to}} oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time; the carboxylation and epoxidation reactions {{are said to be}} coupled reactions.|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of genome sequences, affordable mass spectrometers and high-resolution two-dimensional gels has {{made possible the}} identification of hundreds of proteins from many organisms by peptide mass fingerprinting. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to how information generated by these means can be utilised for detailed protein characterisation. Here we present an approach for the systematic characterisation of proteins using mass spectrometry and a software tool FindMod. This tool, available on the internet at [URL], examines peptide mass fingerprinting data for mass differences between empirical and theoretical peptides. Where mass differences correspond to a post-translational modification, intelligent rules are applied to predict the amino acids in the peptide, if any, that might carry the modification. FindMod rules were constructed by examining 5153 incidences of post-translational modifications documented in the SWISS-PROT database, and for the 22 post-translational modifications currently considered (acetylation, amidation, biotinylation, C-mannosylation, deamidation, flavinylation, farnesylation, formylation, geranyl-geranylation, <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acids,</b> hydroxylation, lipoylation, methylation, myristoylation, N -acyl diglyceride (tripalmitate), O-GlcNAc, palmitoylation, phosphorylation, pyridoxal phosphate, phospho-pantetheine, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, sulphation) a total of 29 different rules were made. These consider which amino acids can carry a modification, whether the modification occurs on N-terminal, C-terminal or internal amino acids, and the type of organisms on which the modification can be found. We illustrate the utility of the approach with proteins from 2 -D gels of Escherichia coli and sheep wool, where post-translational modifications predicted by FindMod were confirmed by MALDI post-source decay peptide fragmentation. As the approach is amenable to automation, it presents a potentially large-scale means of protein characterisation in proteome projects...|$|R
40|$|Keutel {{syndrome}} (KS, MIM 245150) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by abnormal cartilage calcification, peripheral pulmonary stenosis and midfacial hypoplasia(1). A genome search using homozygosity mapping provided evidence of linkage to chromosome 12 p 12. 3 - 13. 1 (maximum multipoint lod score, 4. 06). MGP was a candidate {{on the basis}} of its localization to this chromosomal region and the known function of its protein(2 - 4). MGP maps to chromosome 12 p near D 12 S 363 (refs 2, 3). Human MCP is a 10 -kD skeletal extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that consists of an 84 -aa mature protein and a 19 -aa transmembrane signal peptide(5). It is a member of the Gla protein family, which includes osteocalcin(6), another skeletal ECM protein, and a number of coagulation factors(7) (factors II, VII, IX, X and proteins S and C). All members of this family have glutamic acid residues modified to <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acids</b> (Gla) by a specific gamma-carboxylase using Vitamin K as a cofactors(8, 9). The modified glutamic acid residues of Gla proteins confer a high affinity for mineral ions such as calcium, phosphate and hydroxyapatite crystals, the mineral components of the skeletal ECM. The pattern and tissue distribution of Mgp expression in mice suggest a role for Mgp in regulating ECM calcification(10). Mglap-deficient mice (Mglap(-/-)) have been reported to have inappropriate calcification of cartilage(4). Mutational analysis of MGP in three unrelated probands identified three different mutations: c. 69 delG, IVS 1 - 2 A [...] >G and c. 113 T [...] >A. All three mutations predict a non-functional MGP. Our data indicate that mutations in MGP are responsible for KS and confirm its role in the regulation of extracellular matrix calcification...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{residues}} play {{an important}} role in coagulation. The high-affinity calcium binding sites in the GLA domain of factor IX, which is a serine protease of the coagulation system, were found to partially mediate the binding of factor IXa to platelets and in factor-X activation. In addition, upon mechanical injury to the blood vessel wall, a cell-associated tissue factor becomes exposed and initiates a series of enzymatic reactions localized on a membrane surface generally provided by cells and accumulating platelets. Gla residues partly govern the activation and binding of circulating blood-clotting enzymes and zymogens to this exposed cell membrane surface. Specifically, gla residues are needed in calcium binding and in exposing hydrophobic membrane binding regions to the cell bilayer. Lack of these gla residues results in impaired coagulation or even anticoagulation, which may lead to bleeding diathesis or thrombosis.|$|E
5000|$|Multiple cbEGF domains {{are often}} {{connected}} {{by one or}} two amino acids to form larger, repetitive arrays, here referred to as 'cbEGF modules'. In the blood-clotting cascade, coagulation factors VII, IX and X and protein C contain a tandem of two cbEGF modules, whereas protein S has four. Impressively, in fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, 43 cbEGF modules have been found. The modularity of these proteins adds complexity to protein-protein but also module-module interaction. In factors VII, IX and X, the two cbEGF modules are preceded by an N-terminal <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gla) containing module (the Gla module). In vitro studies on the Gla-cbEGF tandem isolated from factor X revealed a Kd-value of 0.1 mM for calcium binding [...] with the free calcium blood plasma concentrations being approximately 1.2 mM. Surprisingly, {{in the absence of}} the Gla module, the cbEGF module exhibits a Kd-value of 2.2 mM for calcium. Thus, the presence of the Gla module increases calcium affinity 20-fold. Similarly, the activity of Gla and serine protease modules are modified by the cbEGF modules. In the absence of calcium, the Gla and cbEGF modules are highly mobile. As the cbEGF module associates with calcium, however, movement of the Gla module is significantly restricted because the cbEGF module now adopts a conformation that locks the neighboring Gla module in a fixed position. Therefore, calcium coordination induces conformational changes which, in turn, might modulate enzymatic activity.|$|E

The presence of Ama has important biological implications because the malonic acid moiety potentially imparts calcium binding properties to protein. Ama {{was obtained by}} anaerobic alkaline hydrolysis and identified by chromatographic behavior, quantitative acid-mediated decarboxylation to glycine, and unambiguous gas chromatographic/mass spectral detection. The chromatographic, chemical, and mass spectral properties of naturally occurring Ama were identical {{to those of the}} synthetic compound. Amino acid analysis and GC/mass spectrometry also revealed the presence of beta-carboxyaspartic acid and <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> in the base hydrolysate of human atherosclerotic plaque. The ratio of Ama to beta-carboxyaspartic acid to <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> was 20 : 1 : 10, and the quantity of Ama per 1, 000 glycine residues was 0. 2. Ama is a relatively unstable, minor amino acid in complex structures such as bacteria or tissues. This may explain why it has escaped detection previously, despite intensive investigation...|$|E

The patient's plasma contained 5 % Factor IX clotting activity but 100 % Factor IX antigenic activity as determined by immunological assays, which included inhibitor neutralization and a radioimmunoassay for Factor IX. This abnormal Factor IX is called Factor IX Chapel Hill (Factor IXCH). Both normal Factor IX and Factor IXCH have tyrosine as the NH 2 -terminal amino acid. The two proteins have a similar molecular weight, a similar amino acid analysis, {{the same number of}} <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> residues (10 <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> residues), and a similar carbohydrate content. Both exist as a single-chain glycoprotein in plasma.

40|$|Rat type II pneumocytes {{expressed}} vitamin K-dependent carboxylase {{activity that}} incorporated 14 CO 2 into microsomal protein precursors of molecular weights {{similar to those}} of surfactant-associated proteins (SAP). Compared to carboxylated precursor proteins present in the liver, these molecules appeared to be unique to the lung. Antibodies raised against purified rat surfactant reacted with SAP resolved by NaDodSO 4 /PAGE and with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies in type II pneumocyte cytoplasm. NaDodSO 4 /PAGE of microsomal proteins, after carboxylase-catalyzed incorporation of 14 CO 2, demonstrated radiolabeled, immunoreactive products identical to SAP. The presence of <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> in these proteins was confirmed by HPLC analysis of SAP hydrolysates. Furthermore, lung carboxylase activity and SAP matured over similar time courses during fetal lung development. These results show that SAP are carboxylated by type II cells via a vitamin K-dependent pathway analogous to that for hepatic carboxylation of clotting factors. Further analogy to the clotting system suggests that <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> residues in SAP polypeptides play a role in Ca 2 + binding and thus in the known requirements for both the cation and SAP in the physiological function of pulmonary surfactant...|$|E

In adult articular cartilage MGP was present primarily in chondrocytes and the pericellular matrix. Immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed an association between MGP and vesicular structures with an appearance consistent with matrix vesicles.

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of bovine blood coagulation Factor IX (Christmas Factor) is presented and compared with the sequences of other vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins and pancreatic trypsinogen. The 416 -residue sequence of Factor IX was determined largely by automated Edman degradation of two large segments, containing 181 and 235 residues, isolated after activating Factor IX with a protease from Russell's viper venom. Subfragments of the two segments were produced by enzymatic digestion and by chemical cleavage of methionyl, tryptophyl, and asparaginyl-glycyl bonds. Comparison of the {{amino acid sequence}}s of Factor IX, Factor X, and Protein C demonstrates that they are homologous throughout.

40|$|An {{important}} feedback {{mechanism in}} blood coagulation is {{supplied by the}} protein C/protein S anticoagulant pathway. In this study we demonstrate that the binding of human protein S to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) {{is required for the}} expression of cofactor activity of protein S toward factor Va inactivation by activated protein C (APC). The initial rate of endothelial cell-mediated factor Va inactivation was 21. 7 pM factor Va/ 50 pM APC min- 1, which could be enhanced twice at a protein S concentration of 5 nM. This increase appeared to be specific for protein S because it could be inhibited by C 4 b-binding protein and polyclonal antibodies against protein S. Furthermore, thrombin-cleaved protein S did not accelerate factor Va inactivation by APC on endothelial cells. The binding of 125 I-protein S to endothelial cells was time-dependent, specific, saturable, and required the presence of calcium ions. Scatchard analysis revealed (8. 0 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (5) binding sites per cell with an apparent Kd of 24. 4 +/- 2. 2 nM. To study the physiological importance of the binding of protein S to human endothelial cells, seven monoclonal antibodies were examined for their ability to influence the protein S cofactor activity and binding capacity. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> domain and the thrombin-sensitive region of protein S completely inhibited the protein S cofactor function in factor Va inactivation by APC on HUVECs. These monoclonal antibodies also inhibited 125 I-protein S binding to HUVECs. Another monoclonal antibody, directed against an epitope on the third and/or fourth epidermal growth factor-like region, did not influence either protein S cofactor activity or binding of protein S to HUVECs. We conclude that binding of protein S to HUVECs is essential for the expression of its cofactor activity for APC. At least two regions in protein S, the <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> domain and the thrombin-sensitive region, are involved in the expression of cofactor activit...|$|E

Comparing bovine and human prothrombin fragment 1 we found 131 residues to be identical (84 %). In prothrombin fragment 2, 84 residues were identical (71 %). Assuming a time span of 90 million years since the radiation of several orders of placental mammals, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 incorporated one substitution site per 100 amino acid sites every 11. 2 and 6. 3 million years, respectively.

40|$|Protein C {{activation}} on {{the surface}} of the endothelium is critical to the negative regulation of blood coagulation. We now demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies that block protein C binding to the endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) reduce protein C activation rates by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on endothelium, but that antibodies that bind to EPCR without blocking protein C binding have no effect. The kinetic result of blocking the EPCR-protein C interaction is an increased apparent Km for the activation without altering the affinity of thrombin for thrombomodulin. Activation rates of the protein C derivative lacking the <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> domain, which is required for binding to EPCR, are not altered by the anti-EPCR antibodies. These data indicate that the protein C activation complex involves protein C, thrombin, thrombomodulin, and EPCR.

The variables investigated were distal forearm bone mineral content (BMC), biochemical markers of bone formation: serum alkaline phosphatase and serum bone <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> containing protein (BGP) and biochemical markers of bone resorption: fasting urinary calcium and fasting urinary hydroxyproline. Significant relationships were found between BMC and functional impairment and duration of the disease. Indices of bone formation and bone resorption rose with increasing functional impairment, particularly those of bone resorption.

Four of the five DEAE peaks corresponded to those usually found in nephrocalcin from urine; the fifth eluted at a lower ionic strength than any found in urine. Amino acid compositions and surface properties of nephrocalcins isolated from kidney stones closely resembled those of nephrocalcins isolated from urine of stone-forming patients: they differed from normal in lacking <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> residues, and in forming air-water interfacial films that were less stable than those formed by nephrocalcin from normal urine...|$|E

The subsequent molecular dynamics trajectories were calculated using the second-generation AMBER force field. The long-range electrostatic forces were evaluated by the particle mesh Ewald method. The structures that stabilized over a 400 -ps time interval were compared with the corresponding region of the simulated solution structure of bovine prothrombin fragment 1. Structural properties of the <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gla) domains obtained from simulations and calcium binding were found to be conserved for all three proteins. Analysis of the predicted solution structure of the Gla domain of Gas 6 suggests that this domain should bind with negatively charged phospholipid surfaces analogous to bovine prothrombin fragment 1 and protein S...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{aztreonam}} on fecal flora and on descarboxy prothrombin (PIVKA-II) in plasma and <b>gamma-carboxyglutamic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gla) in urine as {{an index of}} vitamin K metabolism were studied in seven children (age range, 2 months to 2 years) with urinary tract infections. Daily doses of aztreonam were 60 to 80 mg/kg. Stool specimens were obtained before the treatment, on days 3 to 5 of aztreonam use, and from 3 to 5 days after the cessation of treatment. The counts of enterobacteria decreased (P less than 0. 01) and those of streptococci increased (P less than 0. 05) during aztreonam treatment. The anaerobic organisms, especially bifidobacteria and bacteroides, showed no marked change. PIVKA-II and Gla were investigated {{before and during the}} treatment with aztreonam. PIVKA-II was not detected in seven patients before or during aztreonam use. There {{were no significant differences in}} the levels of Gla in urine before or during the treatment...|$|E
