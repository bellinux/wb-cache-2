5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic <b>gerrymandering</b> of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a deadlock in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through <b>gerrymandering</b> election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for <b>gerrymandering</b> him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} Liberals repeatedly {{attempted to}} deprive Diefenbaker of his parliamentary seat. In 1948, Lake Centre was redistricted to remove areas which strongly supported Diefenbaker. In spite of that, he was returned in the 1949 election, the only PC member from Saskatchewan. In 1952, a redistricting committee dominated by Liberals abolished Lake Centre entirely, dividing its voters among three other ridings. Diefenbaker stated {{in his memoirs}} that he had considered retiring from the House; with Drew only {{a year older than}} he was, the Westerner saw little prospect of advancement, and had received tempting offers from Ontario law firms. However, the <b>gerrymandering</b> so angered him that he decided to fight for a seat. Diefenbaker's party had taken Prince Albert only once, in 1911, but he decided to stand in that riding for the 1953 election, and was successful. He would hold that seat {{for the rest of his}} life. Even though Diefenbaker campaigned nationally for party candidates, the Progressive Conservatives gained little, rising to 51 seats as St. Laurent led the Liberals to a fifth successive majority. In addition to trying to secure his departure from Parliament, the government opened a home for unwed Indian mothers next door to Diefenbaker's home in Prince Albert.|$|E
25|$|Mixed member {{systems are}} {{susceptible}} to <b>gerrymandering</b> for the local seats that remain a part of such systems. Under parallel voting, a semi-proportional system, there is no compensation for the effects that such <b>gerrymandering</b> might have. Under MMP, the use of compensatory list seats makes <b>gerrymandering</b> less of an issue. However, its effectiveness in this regard depends upon {{the features of the}} system, including the size of the regional districts, the relative share of list seats in the total, and opportunities for collusion that might exist. A striking example of how the compensatory mechanism can be undermined {{can be seen in the}} 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election, where the leading party, Fidesz, combined <b>gerrymandering</b> and decoy lists, which resulted in a two-thirds parliamentary majority from a 45% vote. This illustrates how certain implementations of MMP can produce moderately proportional outcomes, similar to parallel voting.|$|E
25|$|Especially in Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian areas, {{critics have}} {{attacked}} the administrative division of Slovakia {{as a case}} of <b>gerrymandering,</b> designed so that in all eight regions, Hungarians are in the minority. Under the 1996 law of reorganization, only two districts (Dunajská Streda and Komárno) have a Hungarian-majority population. While also done to maximize {{the success of the}} party Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the <b>gerrymandering</b> in ethnic Hungarian areas worked to minimize the Hungarians' voting power. In all eight regions, Hungarians are in the minority, though five regions have Hungarian populations within the 10 to 30 per cent range. The Slovak government established new territorial districts from north to south, dividing the Hungarian community into five administrative units, where they became a minority in each administrative unit. The Hungarian community saw a substantial loss of political influence in this <b>gerrymandering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eventually the Texas Eleven was vindicated by the United States Supreme Court {{through its}} rulings that the re-districting could be {{considered}} <b>gerrymandering</b> and did bear unconstitutional elements.|$|E
25|$|His {{campaign}} platform {{was unique}} for its clear priority on passing one thing first: the Citizen Equality Act, {{a proposal that}} coupled campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing <b>gerrymandering</b> and ensuring voting access.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett's {{district}} was significantly altered in redistricting plans released in October 2011, which {{was described as}} <b>gerrymandering.</b> The Washington Post reported that the new district lines shifted the district slightly to the south, adding some heavily Democratic territory closer to Washington DC.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the role}} of the Election Commission to draw, review and re-delineate electoral {{district}} boundaries. The last delineation was made on 21 March 2003. As of 2013, there are a total of 222 parliamentary districts and 576 state assembly districts in Malaysia. The EC has been accused of practising <b>gerrymandering</b> during delineation exercises.|$|E
25|$|Hare criticized Schilling {{for living}} 0.99 miles outside the 17th District, though the Constitution only {{requires}} congressmen {{to live in}} the state they wish to represent. Schilling's wife notes that the family's restaurant is in the 17th and employs people and pays taxes there. She also says the family fell out of the district because of <b>gerrymandering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{has stated}} that if elected President he would resign in favor of his vice {{president}} when he accomplishes his three stated objectives, which involve addressing campaign finance reform, voting rights issues and political <b>gerrymandering.</b> Prior to his {{dropping out of the}} race, he had yet to announce his vice presidential running mate, which he said would have been decided at the Democratic National Convention.|$|E
25|$|The {{party is}} very {{supportive}} of improving voting rights as well as election accuracy and accessibility. They support ending voter ID laws and increasing voting time, including making election day a holiday. They support reforming the electoral system to eliminate <b>gerrymandering</b> as well as passing comprehensive campaign finance reform. They supported the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and as a party have often been pioneers for democracy in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952 (1996), is a United States Supreme Court case {{concerning}} racial <b>gerrymandering,</b> where {{racial minority}} majority-electoral districts were created during Texas' 1990 redistricting to increase minority Congressional representation. The Supreme Court, in a plurality opinion, held that race was the predominant {{factor in the}} creation of the districts and that under a strict scrutiny standard the three districts were not narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{city will}} phase in district-based instead of at-large {{elections}} {{for all but}} one seat on the city council, beginning in November 2018. Two new seats will be added, from five seats to seven. Six of the seats will require residence inside a district, while the seat held by the mayor will remain at large. The council chose the new district boundaries in June 2017, a controversial vote that drew accusations of <b>gerrymandering</b> to favor two of the incumbents.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} talks of {{reforming}} electoral law to reduce <b>gerrymandering</b> in constituency boundaries and guarantee greater proportionality. Taher Odwan, formerly editor-in-chief of Al Arab Al Yawm, a Jordanian newspaper, that was critical towards the government, was appointed minister of media affairs and communications. Odwan pledged enhanced press freedoms {{and access to}} information. A $500m package of price cuts in fuel and staples, including sugar and rice, was announced, along with salary increases for civil servants and the military.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method used}} early in U.S. history was {{to divide the}} state into electoral {{district}}s. By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference {{stems from the fact}} every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to <b>gerrymandering.</b>|$|E
25|$|Georgia was {{the last}} state to fall, with Sonny Perdue taking the {{governorship}} in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win. In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed {{nearly all of the}} <b>gerrymandering</b> engineered by Tom DeLay that swung the Texas Congressional delegation to the GOP in 2004. DeLay himself was acquitted on appeal in 2013 of illegally funding the state GOP.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} was commonly {{considered to be}} typical of <b>gerrymandering.</b> It covered {{some or all of}} the following cities in Orange County: Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach, Los Alamitos, Seal Beach, and Westminster. In Los Angeles County, the district covered Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Palos Verdes Estates part of Long Beach, and a very small portion of the San Pedro neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles, and Santa Catalina Island, on which Avalon was the only city. The district also included the whole of the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach.|$|E
25|$|According to Béla Angyal, due to <b>gerrymandering</b> and disproportionate {{distribution}} of population between Bohemia and Slovakia the Hungarians had little {{representation in the}} National Assembly and thus their influence {{on the politics of}} Czechoslovakia remained limited. The same considerations have limited the Slovak intelligentsia's political power as well. On the other hand, Hungarians founded numerous parties including pro-Czechoslovak parties, founded parties with agrarian, social-democratic, Christian-socialist and other orientations, were active as sections of statewide Czechoslovak parties, had opportunities to participate in government and in 20's Hungarian members of parliament participated on adoption of several important laws with statewide impact.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Internet allows {{alternative}} distribution channels, such as freewares downloading {{and through}} platforms such as Steam, and later Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network or WiiWare. New mainstream developments tools, like Flash, allow a democratization of game production. These elements {{give rise to}} new dynamics in the industry, such as fangame, independent game and serious game. This last category refers to games tackling serious issues like war, global warming or <b>gerrymandering.</b> In the 2000s, theses game receive more coverage by both gaming and general press. They have however bad reputation because of widely criticised gameplay and game design flaws.|$|E
25|$|Writing in the ‘’New York Daily News’’ {{about the}} April 2010 elections, Dan Morrison stated that in {{addition}} to such “structural issues” as “the manipulated census, the <b>gerrymandering,</b> the packing of the National Election Commission with ruling party retainers, or the use of patronage to secure blocks of votes and suppress competition,” there were reports of school children who were allowed to cast votes; soldiers who voted “both at their duty station and also, magically, at their home villages hundreds of miles away”; election officials who used “solvents to dilute the indelible ink that is meant to stain the fingers and prevent repeat voting”; and “stuffed or stolen” ballot boxes.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} theory about the {{skeleton}} {{is that it}} is that of a Norman De Burgh knight who was starved to death in the castle dungeons in 1332 on the orders of his cousin the above-mentioned Earl of Ulster. Another explanation put forward was that it depicted Cahir O'Doherty (Sir Charles O'Dogherty), who was put to death after Derry was invested by the English army in 1608. During the days of <b>Gerrymandering</b> and discrimination against the Catholic population of Derry, Derry's Roman Catholics often used to claim in dark wit that the skeleton was a local waiting for help from the council bureaucracy.|$|E
25|$|Alberta's {{other main}} {{leader at the}} time was Frank Oliver. He founded Edmonton's {{influential}} Bulletin newspaper in 1880 from which he espoused a sharp criticism of Liberal policies in the West. He was especially disapproving of Ukrainian settlement. He was elected to the territorial assembly, but resigned to become a federal MP. He replaced Sifton as Minister of the Interior and set about reducing support for European immigration. At the same time {{he was in charge of}} drawing up the boundaries of the provincial ridings for the 1905 Alberta elections. He is accused by some of <b>gerrymandering</b> the boundaries to favour Liberal Edmonton over Tory Calgary.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{has seen}} very little <b>gerrymandering</b> of electoral boundaries, {{relevant}} {{only for the}} House of Representatives and State Legislative Assemblies, which have nearly always been drawn up by public servants or independent boundary commissioners. But Australia has seen systematic malapportionment of electorates. All colonial legislatures before Federation, and the federal parliament after it, allocated more representation to rural districts than their populations merited. This was justified on several grounds, such as that country people {{had to contend with}} greater distances and hardships, that country people (and specifically farmers) produced most of the nation's real wealth, and that greater country representation was necessary to balance the radical tendencies of the urban population.|$|E
25|$|The {{court ruled}} in 2014, after lengthy testimony, {{that at least}} two districts had to be redrawn because of <b>gerrymandering.</b> After this was appealed, in July 2015 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had {{followed}} an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives, and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn. On December 2, 2015, a 5–2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts, some of which was drawn by challengers. Their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by Leon County Judge Terry Lewis, who had overseen the original trial. It particularly makes changes in South Florida. There are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Jumblatt failed for {{the first}} time in the {{parliamentary}} elections, complaining of electoral <b>gerrymandering</b> and election fraud by the authorities. Two years later, he was one of the main leaders of a major political uprising against Camille Chamouns Maronite-dominated government, which soon escalated into street fights and guerilla attacks. While the revolt reflected a number of political and sectarian conflicts, it had a pan-Arabist ideology, and was heavily supported through Syria by the newly formed United Arab Republic. The uprising ended after the United States intervened on the side of the Chamoun government and sent the U.S. Marine Corps to occupy Beirut. A political settlement followed by which Fuad Chehab was appointed new President of the Republic.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Republicans in Pennsylvania, who {{controlled}} {{both houses of}} the legislature {{as well as the}} governorship, put forward a plan to change the state's winner-takes-all system to a congressional district method system. Pennsylvania had voted for the Democratic candidate in the five previous presidential elections, so some saw this as an attempt to take away Democratic electoral votes. Although Democrat Barack Obama won Pennsylvania in 2008, he won only 55% of Pennsylvania's popular vote. The district plan would have awarded him 11 of its 21 electoral votes, a 52.4% that is closer to the popular vote yet still overcoming Republican <b>gerrymandering.</b> The plan later lost support. Other Republicans, including Michigan state representative Pete Lund, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have floated similar ideas.|$|E
25|$|Pangasinan, {{which was}} {{historically}} {{part of the}} Central Luzon Region, was made part of the Ilocos Region (Region I) in the <b>gerrymandering</b> of the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos, {{despite the fact that}} Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 {{percent of the population of}} Region 1. Many Pangasinans prefer to have their own Pangasinan Region or be returned to Central Luzon.|$|E
25|$|All {{the accusations}} of <b>gerrymandering,</b> {{practically}} all the complaints about housing and regional policy, and a disproportionate {{amount of the}} charges about public and private employment come from this area. The area – which consisted of Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, Londonderry County Borough, and portions of Counties Londonderry and Armagh – had {{less than a quarter}} of the total population of Northern Ireland yet generated not far short of three-quarters of the complaints of discrimination...The unionist government must bear its share of responsibility. It put through the original gerrymander which underpinned so many of the subsequent malpractices, and then, despite repeated protests, did nothing to stop those malpractices continuing. The most serious charge against the Northern Ireland government is not that it was directly responsible for widespread discrimination, but that it allowed discrimination on such a scale over a substantial segment of Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} also nominally appoints, upon {{recommendation of the}} prime minister, the individual ministers to head each of the government departments. The cabinet is selected from {{among the members of}} the House of Representatives. The Constitution provides for general elections to be held at least every five years. Candidates are elected by the Single Transferable Vote system. The entire territory is divided into thirteen electoral districts each returning five MPs to a total of 65. Since 1987, in case a Party obtains an absolute majority of votes without achieving a Parliamentary majority a mechanism in the Constitution provides for additional seats to that Party to achieve a Parliamentary majority (Act IV of 1987). To date this mechanism, intended to counteract <b>gerrymandering,</b> came into effect twice: for the Sixth and the Eighth Parliaments. A similar mechanism was introduced in 1996 so that additional seats would be given to that Party obtaining a relative majority of votes but not a parliamentary majority with only two parties achieving Parliamentary representation. This mechanism was first applied in the 2008 general election.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Roman Republic contributed {{significantly}} to many aspects of democracy, {{only a minority of}} Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of <b>gerrymandering,</b> so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the major party {{realignment}} that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the Democratic Party, while the suburbs tend to vote Republican. A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the 2003 Texas redistricting. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan <b>gerrymandering,</b> and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the Supreme Court of the United States has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan {{with the exception of a}} Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett's district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 2015, Lessig {{announced}} that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by Labor Day 2015. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in The New York Times and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing <b>gerrymandering</b> and ensuring voting access. As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant <b>gerrymandering</b> to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{population}} increases {{recorded in the}} 1990 United States Census, Georgia picked up an additional seat for the 1992 U.S. House elections. However, the Democratic-controlled Georgia General Assembly, {{under the leadership of}} fiercely partisan Speaker of the House Tom Murphy, specifically targeted Gingrich, eliminating the district which he Gingrich represented. <b>Gerrymandering</b> split Gingrich's territory among three neighboring districts. Much of the southern portion of Gingrich's district, including his home in Carrollton, was drawn into the Columbus-based 3rd District, represented by five-term Democrat Richard Ray. Gingrich remarked that [...] "The Speaker, by raising money and <b>gerrymandering,</b> has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out." ...|$|E
