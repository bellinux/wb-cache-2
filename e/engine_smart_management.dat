It {{is not about}} the consumption of resources, because that is already covered in the Cost Control value driver. Within VDM, a distinction is made between four types of resources: technicians, spare parts, contractors and knowledge. One need to think only of cash flows freed up as a result of <b>smarter</b> <b>management</b> or savings on warehouses, logistical employees, insurance and the avoidance of obsolete and surplus spare parts. In practise, it often turns out that the value potential of <b>smart</b> <b>management</b> of spare parts by far exceeds the value potential of the other resources.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} of world population and personal energy demand, overall energy demand rises {{day to day}} and therefore, {{it will be very}} difficult and inefficient to meet this increasing demand by conventional electrical grid structure in near future. The conventional electrical grids do not well suit for efficient and sustainable solutions related to reducing transmission losses, integrating renewable energy sources, flexible demand and energy pricing. Today, there is an urgent need for smart grid in order to balance energy demand and generation more efficient, more environmentally friendly, more flexible and reliably. For these proposes, smart grid should provide observable and controllable network structure from energy generation, transmission, distribution to consumption and thus it provides <b>smart</b> <b>management</b> of energy systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} design of a <b>smart</b> battery <b>management</b> system for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based portable electronic devices. It is a novel concept of incorporating the functionality of a <b>smart</b> battery <b>management</b> system into the FPGA used by portable electronic devices, which provides the following advantages. (1) It lowers cost since the conventional commercial independent battery management circuit can be eliminated; (2) It offers more flexibility because FPGA based battery management algorithms can be specifically designed for different battery chemistries of different devices and can provide the flexibility of algorithms and functionalities updating as well. <b>Smart</b> battery <b>management</b> system concepts include four aspects: (1) smart charging; (2) battery balancing; (3) smart discharging; and (4) safety operating. One novel charging algorithm, which combines the merits of multistage charging and pulse charging, is proposed to charge a Li-ion battery pack smartly. A Proportional Integral (PI) control method is introduced to achieve the current control of charging circuit with considerable close loop stability. Simulation results from the PSIM 9. 0. 4 software package and experimental results from the prototype built in the lab are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of smart charging. The realizations of battery balancing, smart discharging, and safety operating are also briefly described {{by taking advantage of}} the proposed FPGA based <b>smart</b> battery <b>management</b> system topology, which verify the feasibility of the proposed FPGA based <b>smart</b> battery <b>management</b> system for portable electronic devices...|$|R

40|$|The Smart Grid, {{regarded}} as the next generation power grid, uses two-way communication of electricity and information to create a widely distributed automated energy delivery network. In this article, a review work on different aspects on the enabling technologies for the Smart Grid is being presented. Infrastructure of Smart Grid can be broadly classified into three terms namely the smart infrastructure system, the <b>smart</b> <b>management</b> system, and the smart protection system. We also presented a review work in which implementation strategy of Smart Grid in different countries was briefly highlighted. In this paper then some advantages and hindrance of Smart Grid was also explained. Specifically, we focused for the smart infrastructure system, we explore the smart energy subsystem, the smart information subsystem, and the smart communication subsystem. For the <b>smart</b> <b>management</b> system, we explore various management objectives, such as improving energy efficiency, profiling demand, maximizing utility, reducing cost, and controlling emission. We also explore various management methods to achieve these objectives. For the smart protection system, we explore various failure protection mechanisms which improve {{the reliability of the}} Smart Grid, and explore the security and privacy issues in the Smart Grid. ...|$|R
