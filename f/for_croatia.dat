5|$|Dario Šimić was Croatia's {{first player}} to reach 100 appearances, doing so before his {{retirement}} in 2008. This allowed him to surpass Robert Jarni's previous record of 81 appearances. On 6 February 2013, captain Darijo Srna, Josip Šimunić and Stipe Pletikosa each also played their 100th cap <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> in a 4–0 friendly victory over South Korea in London. The trio went on to set a new joint-record of 101 appearances for the national team on 22 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifying victory against Serbia in Zagreb. Srna eventually surpassed his teammates and accrued 134 international caps <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> Ivica Olić has since also appeared 104 times <b>for</b> <b>Croatia,</b> with his 100th cap coming against Italy at San Siro on 16 November 2014.|$|E

5|$|German–Partisan {{prisoner}} exchanges re-commenced in late 1943, {{but became}} {{the responsibility of}} the Partisan Chief Headquarters <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> rather than Partisan Supreme Headquarters. Initially these were organised by Stilinović, then by Dr. Josip Brnčić, before Boris Bakrač took over the role. Between March 1944 and May 1945, Bakrač attended about 40 meetings with German representatives, 25 of which were in Zagreb under agreements for safe conduct. On the German side, Ott continued to play a leading role. These negotiations resulted in the exchange of between 600 and 800 Partisans in total.|$|E
5|$|In Group D of UEFA Euro 2016, Croatia {{were drawn}} against Turkey, Czech Republic, and Spain. They {{defeated}} Turkey 1–0, on a goal by Luka Modrić, and drew 2–2 against the Czechs in a match marred by fans throwing flares on the pitch during the 86th minute. They ended group play by defeating Spain 2–1 on an 87th-minute goal by Ivan Perišić, handing the Spanish their first loss in Euro competition since Euro 2004 {{and winning the}} group <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is not}} {{a public}} holiday, 15 January is marked as the day Croatia won {{international}} recognition by Croatian media and politicians. On the day's 10th anniversary in 2002, the Croatian National Bank minted a 25 kuna commemorative coin. In the period following the declaration of independence, the war escalated, with the sieges of Vukovar and Dubrovnik, and fighting elsewhere, until a ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to stabilization and a significant reduction of violence. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> as a result of Operation Storm. Present day borders of Croatia were established when the remaining Serb-held areas of Eastern Slavonia were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> and the RSK.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990, to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's policy of pursuing independence <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martić, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In a {{case before}} the International Court of Justice, Croatia filed a suit against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 2 July 1999, citing Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. With the {{transformation}} of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro and the dissolution of that country in 2006, Serbia is considered its legal successor. The application was filed <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> by a U.S. lawyer, David B. Rivkin. Serbia reciprocated with the genocide lawsuit against the Republic of Croatia on 4 January 2010. The Serbian application covers missing people, killed people, refugees, expelled people, and all military actions and concentration camps with a historical account of World War II persecution of Serbs committed by the Independent State of Croatia during World War II.|$|E
50|$|In late March 2009, he {{received}} his first call-up <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> senior national team after being named to their squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Andorra on 1 April 2009.|$|R
50|$|On 29 September 2008, he {{received}} his first full international call-up <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Ukraine and Andorra the following October, but did not feature {{in any of the}} two matches.|$|R
50|$|Prahić rose {{through all}} youth levels playing for Varteks before debuting in top-flight {{football}} in 2006. He also has 40 caps <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> youth teams. On 16 December 2010 CS Sedan signed Croatian centre-back from Varteks until June 2012.|$|R
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defences, it doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police. The Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved from January 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win support from the European Community (EC) and the United States <b>for</b> <b>Croatia,</b> and he disregarded advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuđman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.|$|E
5|$|The Brioni Agreement {{isolated}} Marković {{who tried}} to preserve the federation, but was ignored by van den Broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him, and the EC delegation tacitly encouraged the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The agreement diminished the authority of part of the JNA's leadership who fought {{for the preservation of}} the Yugoslav federation. The agreement was also unfavourable <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> because it was left to defend against the JNA and Serb forces. By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the agreement fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists' goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders. Sabrina Ramet noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an agreement in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia's independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević's interest to create a Greater Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
50|$|As of October 2009, he {{has earned}} 33 caps and scored 11 goals <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> {{national}} team at various youth levels between 2003 and 2009. {{and was a}} first-team member of the squad which participated at the 2005 European Under-17 Championship.|$|R
50|$|Sunara was {{considered}} a promising player when he was younger, and was capped seven times <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> U-20 and U-21 selections between 1998 and 2001, and {{was part of the}} squad which competed at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship.|$|R
50|$|Bačelić-Grgić {{was also}} capped {{a total of}} 25 times and scored 10 goals <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> U-16, U-17 and U-19 teams between 2003 and 2006, and was a regular member of the squad which won fourth place at the 2005 European Under-17 Championship.|$|R
5|$|The EU {{accession}} referendum {{passed with}} 66.27% of votes cast in support and 33.13% against EU membership <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> There were 0.6% blank or invalid votes. Even though all Croatian citizens were voting {{in a single}} constituency for the referendum's purposes, the State Election Committee published the results by individual counties, cities, and municipalities. The referendum passed in all Croatian counties. The greatest support for the referendum was recorded in Međimurje and Brod-Posavina counties at 75.73% and 72.61% respectively. The lowest support for the EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County, where 42.22% votes were cast against the proposal. The Croatian diaspora voted 83.13% in support. Only 18 out of 556 cities or municipalities in Croatia voted against the referendum proposal. Of those, six are in Split-Dalmatia County, four in Koprivnica-Križevci County, two in Zagreb and Dubrovnik-Neretva counties each, and a single municipality in Istria, Primorje-Gorski Kotar, Šibenik-Knin and Zadar counties each.|$|E
5|$|The {{confrontation}} {{resulted in}} a further deterioration of the overall situation in Croatia, leading Croats and Serbs to accuse each other of overt aggression and of being enemies of their nation. <b>For</b> <b>Croatia,</b> the event was provocative because the bodies {{of some of the}} dead Croat policemen killed in the incident were reportedly mutilated. The clash in Borovo Selo eliminated any hopes that the escalating conflict could be defused politically and made the war almost inevitable. The Presidency of Yugoslavia met days after the fighting and authorised the JNA to deploy to the area to prevent further conflict but despite this deployment, skirmishes persisted in the region. After the war, a former Serb irregular was convicted of war crimes for his role in abusing two captured policemen, and ultimately sentenced to three years in prison. Four others were indicted in absentia but remain at large outside Croatia.|$|E
5|$|From late June through July, {{northern}} Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but {{no actual}} combat; nonetheless, the conflict's increasing intensity {{in the region}} (and elsewhere in Croatia) caused residents of Zadar to build bomb shelters. SAO Krajina authorities called up three TO units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July (a day after the fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area), {{and at the end}} of July the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps began conscripting the Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo (near Obrovac); they were involved in combat with the SAO Krajina TO and police forces two days later, the first engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. Growing appetites of the SAO Krajina were announced in mid-August, when Milan Martić, one of its leaders, spoke of a planned conquest of Zadar. Later that month, the JNA openly sided with the SAO Krajina. On 26 August the 9th (Knin) Corps troops and artillery (commanded by chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladić) attacked the village of Kijevo, advancing with SAO Krajina forces to expel all Croats from the village. Another regional setback <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> was the 11 September JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge, cutting the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{he served}} as an advisor <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> BBC team which {{was working on the}} world-famous {{documentary}} The Death of Yugoslavia. From 1993 until the late 1990s, he was also a regular contributor for Erasmus, a magazine which promoted liberal democracy.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} capped 41 times <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> youth teams at various age levels between 2001 and 2005 {{and was a}} first-team member of the squad which won third place at the 2001 European Under-16 Championship. He also {{appeared}} in all three Croatia's matches at the 2001 Under-17 World Cup.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Lakić {{won three}} {{international}} caps for the Croatian national under-21 team. On 2 November 2010, {{he was named}} to the squad <b>for</b> <b>Croatia's</b> UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Malta later that month, but did not feature in the match. He is yet to make his full international debut.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions in the republic worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) weapons to miminize the possibility of resistance {{following the}} elections. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990 to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's policy of pursuing independence <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martić, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia. In March 1991, the SAO Krajina authorities backed by the Serbian government started to consolidate control over Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The move resulted in a bloodless skirmish in Pakrac and the first fatalities in the Plitvice Lakes incident. By early May, the conflict also escalated in the region of eastern Slavonia, culminating in the Battle of Borovo Selo, just to the south of the village of Dalj. On 25–26 June, Croatian Serbs in the eastern Slavonia established the SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (SAO SBWS), declaring it an autonomous political entity.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{view of the}} JNA role in the Serb revolt {{gradually}} evolved between January and September 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win support <b>for</b> <b>Croatia</b> {{from the}} European Community (EC) and the United States, and he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuđman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to a defensive role even though {{the actions of the}} JNA appeared to be coordinated with Croatian Serb forces. This impression was reinforced by buffer zones the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNGthe JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of the territory. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks. After the start of the JNA intervention in Slovenia in late June, conscripts began deserting from the JNA and very few were drafted to replace them, except in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{campaign}} was criticized as having poor promotional videos, especially lacking in informational value. The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents a great opportunity <b>for</b> <b>Croatia.</b> In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would vote in favour of joining the EU.|$|E
