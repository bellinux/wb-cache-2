Fox became enthusiastic about working with Jackson when he saw Heavenly Creatures at the Toronto International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{attracted}} by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E

5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun, Smith {{attacked}} Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mat. Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.|$|E
5|$|The {{fifth and}} final bout {{of the main}} card was the UFC Welterweight Championship match between Georges St-Pierre and B.J. Penn, {{regulated}} by referee Herb Dean. The bout started out with the two fighters clinching and throwing knees. St-Pierre dropped down for a single-leg takedown but Penn defended while standing on one leg with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cage. Unable to get the takedown, St-Pierre let go and connected with a right hand punch. They met up and clinched {{in the middle of}} the cage with St-Pierre pushing Penn towards the fence. There, St-Pierre attempted a takedown but went back the clinch when he was unable to finish it. The two fighters continued trading punches to end the first round.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's Flaying of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E
5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in {{this preliminary}} action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against the Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move checked the advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing that victory was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing {{from the rest of}} the line. The charge was successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three of the companies attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E
25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from stage fright throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, {{with his head}} down and his hair in his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere in the world, Nelson's Column in Montreal {{was erected}} by both British and French {{citizens}} in 1809, {{and there is}} also a Mount Nelson, near Invermere, British Columbia. As at London, the column in Montreal has the admiral standing with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waves. A much shorter statue of Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square, Bridgetown, Barbados is older than its counterpart in London.|$|E

25|$|The rubrics of the Roman Missal now {{prescribe}} {{that the}} priest should face {{the people at}} six points of the Mass. The priest celebrating the Tridentine Mass was required to face the people, turning if necessary <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> altar, eight times. The priest is still expressly directed to face the altar {{at exactly the same}} points as in the Tridentine Mass. His position in relation to the altar determines, as before, whether facing the altar means also facing the people.|$|E
25|$|There is an oil {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler of a match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury in August 1906, {{the season in}} which Kent won their first official County Championship title. The painting shows Colin Blythe, the pavilion behind him, bowling to Tyldesley who has <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> artist. Tyldesley is depicted as very still, even though delivery is imminent, with an orthodox stance. Kent won the match by an innings and 195 runs, Tyldesley scoring 19 and 4.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the space}} between the opponent's {{defensive}} line and midfielder line ('the hole'): A common build-up of attacks is to pass the ball into {{the space between}} the opponent's defenders and midfielders. Normally, an attacker with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goal will receive the pass. He will seek to turn with the ball, or distribute it to a player facing the goal, who optimally also is in front of the opponent's midfielders - or even on the move into the space behind the opponent's defenders.|$|E

25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} an open window with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E
25|$|From {{the middle}} of the 17th century, almost all new Latin-rite altars were built against a wall or backed by a reredos, with a {{tabernacle}} placed on the altar or inserted into the reredos. This meant that the priest turned to the people, putting <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> altar, only for a few short moments at Mass. However, the Tridentine Missal itself speaks of celebrating versus populum, and gives corresponding instructions for the priest when performing actions that in the other orientation involved turning around in order to face the people.|$|E
25|$|With <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, Reagan won {{shocking}} {{victories in}} North Carolina and Texas, which propelled the race {{all the way}} to the national convention in Kansas City. Laxalt nominated Reagan at the convention. Eventually, the Reagan campaign lost a key procedural vote to Ford and the sitting President eked out a victory. Although he was on the losing side, Laxalt's national profile increased dramatically as a result of his efforts on behalf of Reagan. When Reagan defeated incumbent President Jimmy Carter in 1980, with Laxalt again serving as national chairman, the Nevada Senator's profile rose even higher.|$|E
