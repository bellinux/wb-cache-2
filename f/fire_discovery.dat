40|$|In {{this third}} {{part of a}} three-part video mission-highlights set, spacecrew {{operations}} between the STS- 96 Space Shuttle Orbiter Discovery and the International Space Station, as well as STS reentry and landing is reviewed. The flight crew consists of Kent V. Rominger, Commander; Rick D. Husband, Pilot; and Mission Specialists Ellen Ochoa, Tamara E. Jernigan, Daniel T. Barry, Julie Payette (Canadian), and Valery Ivanovich Tokarev (Russian). The primary goals of this mission were to work on logistics and resupply the International Space Station. This third part of the three part series includes footage from Flight Days 8 - 11 (FD 8 - 11) of the mission. FD 8 includes the crew members moving the last items from Discovery into the International Space Station (ISS), closing the final hatch on the orbiting outpost and commanding a series of 17 pulses of Discovery's reaction control system jets to boost the station's orbit. Discovery undocks from the station, performs a 2 1 / 2 lap flyaround of the station, before Husband <b>fires</b> <b>Discovery's</b> jets in a final burst to move Discovery away from the station, concluding six days of docked operations. After the flyaround, Husband <b>fires</b> <b>Discovery's</b> jets to depart the station's vicinity. Beginning FD 9, as Discovery departs from the station, Mission Specialists Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry pack away the space suit gear they used during their spacewalk early in the mission, while Commander Kent Rominger and Pilot Rick Husband practice landings on a laptop computer program. Mission Specialists Julie Payette and Valery Tokarev help to stow gear and repressurize the shuttle's cabin to its standard 14. 7 pounds per square inch. The crew also readies to deploy a small, student-built payload called STARSHINE (Student Tracked Atmospheric Research Satellite for Heuristic International Networking Equipment). In and around landing preparations and the STARSHINE deploy, the crew stowe all equipment used throughout the mission. The STARSHINE satellite ejects from a canister in Discovery's payload bay on FD 10. FD 11 is completed as Discovery swoops {{out of the darkness}} as Commander Kent Rominger sets the shuttle and his crewmates down on Runway 15 at the Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida to successfully complete the first shuttle mission of the year.

25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2.

After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton <b>fired</b> <b>Discoverys</b> Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|R

50|$|On July 7, 1977 {{at about}} 1:15 AM, a fire began in an inmate's clothes hanging on wooden pegs {{in one of}} the prison washrooms, and before it was {{extinguished}} about 45 minutes later, five inmates had died of smoke inhalation. The most significant factors contributing to the deadly fire were the presence of fuels that promoted rapid flame and smoke development, the failure to evacuate occupants quickly and reliably (the two primary exits were blocked by the fire and a broken key in a lock, leaving a narrow catwalk as the only exit), and the fire not being extinguished in an incipient stage. An automatic sprinkler system would have been the most reliable fire defense; however, even without automatic detection and suppression equipment, the fire safety system, with little expenditure of money, could have been more effective by revisions to emergency procedures in the fire plan. The Danbury Fire Department was not called until about 15 minutes after the <b>fire's</b> <b>discovery</b> because of a fire plan that called for initial use of the institution's firefighting resources, but the inmate fire brigade was never released from housing units and the institution's fire apparatus was never used. The ensuing public outcry led to several investigations and reviews of the prison's fire safety systems and protocols. A comprehensive program of fuel control, additional fire detection and suppression equipment, and training and planning sessions have also been established, not only at FCI Danbury but {{throughout the rest of the}} federal prison system.|$|R

Within the next 30 minutes, the Morro Castle became engulfed in flames. As the fire grew in intensity, Acting Captain Warms attempted to beach the ship, but the growing need to launch lifeboats and abandon ship forced him to give up this strategy. Within 20 minutes of the <b>fire's</b> <b>discovery</b> (at about 3:10), the fire burned through the ship's main electrical cables, plunging the ship into darkness. As all power was lost, the radio stopped working as well, so that the crew were cut off from radio contact after issuing a single SOS transmission. At about the same time, the wheelhouse {{lost the ability to}} steer the ship, as those hydraulic lines were severed by the fire as well. Cut off by the fire amidships, passengers tended to gravitate toward the stern. Most crew members, on the other hand, moved to the forecastle. On the ship, no one could see anything.

40|$|Rechargeable lithium-based {{battery is}} one of the most {{promising}} battery candidates for high energy storage devices. Batteries containing lithium metal, eschewed the use of carbon supporting materials can lead to as much as a ten-fold improvement in anode storage capacity from 360 mAh g- 1 to 3860 mAh g- 1 and would open up opportunities for high energy un-lithiated cathode materials such as sulfur and oxygen, among others. Unfortunately, significant improvements in safe and stable battery performance are needed due to the non-uniform lithium deposition on the negative electrode. These uneven dendritic structures increase the potential risk of cell short-circuiting, energy fading or even <b>fire</b> hazards. Recent <b>discoveries</b> and advances have focused on electrolyte reconfigurations for the sake of suppressing or even eliminating dendrite formation. Of the various options, ionic liquids offer multiple synergetic properties that make them attractive electrolytes for extending lifetime and safety of LMBs. Their inherently low vapor pressure, non-flammability, good electrochemical stability in the presence of metallic lithium make ILs excellent choice in fail-safe LMBs. When anchored to metal oxide nanoparticle surface, it promotes the mechanical strength as well as maintaining the advantages of ILs. This dissertation researches ionic liquid-tethered hybrid nanoparticle electrolytes with several goals: improving room temperature ionic conductivity of the electrolytes while maintaining chemical and mechanical stabilities, improving lithium-ion transference number, and studying the dendritic lithium metal growth as a function of electrolyte properties. It is found that all types of IL electrolytes show improvements over the conventional electrolytes such as propylene carbonate in LiTFSI. It also found that untethered IL has comparable cell lifetime to tethered IL and piperidinium-based IL suppresses dendrite growth more efficiently than imidazolium-based IL. Later in this dissertation, we discussed the efforts of extending the cell lifetime beyond ionic 3 liquid platform.
