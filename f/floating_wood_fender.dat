Because of the low angle of the string over the nut, string trees may be used to avoid the string coming out of the nut while playing.|$|R

40|$|Urban areas {{developing}} over inclined {{land near}} the base of mountains have sometimes been damaged severely by flood hazard with water and sediment overflowing from river channels. For {{the purpose of the}} prevention and mitigation of this damage, recent flood damage of river channels was researched to find out its essential aspects. Revetments destruction, one of its main aspects, have been studied by continuing fundamental experiments. Damage of revetments model can be determined by two factors, current velocity and bank slope. One of the other characteristic features is conveyance and deposition of <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> by flood water. Mode and concentration of transport of <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> were discussed qualitatively,on their geometry relative to river channel dimensions, and on take-in process by peak flows, respectively. An experimental facility was designed to investigate the mechanism of this flood damage, while an optical triangulation system with a laser electronic theodolite of motor-driven was newly developed for the measurement of the experiments...|$|R

50|$|Laminate {{flooring}} (also called <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> tile in the United States) is a multi-layer synthetic flooring product fused {{together with}} a lamination process. Laminate flooring simulates wood (or sometimes stone) with a photographic applique layer under a clear protective layer. The inner core layer is usually composed of melamine resin and fiber board materials. There is a European Standard No. EN 13329:2000 specifying laminate floor covering requirements and testing methods.|$|R

Jack Mason however then scored 126 in 125 minutes and with useful scoring by Albert Lawton they reached 432/8 at the close.|$|R

50|$|In Texas, this {{damselfly}} is on {{the wing}} between April and December. Males are often to be seen hovering {{over the surface of}} the water well away from the shore, but they sometimes perch in shrubby vegetation, concealed by overhanging foliage. The females are seldom seen except in the company of males. Eggs are laid while the pair are in tandem on <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> debris or on the stems of submerged plants, and there are often other threadtails and dancer damselflies seeking to lay in the same locations. Egg-laying is at its peak in the middle of the day and then diminishes.|$|R
50|$|Though {{part of the}} threadtail family, {{the abdomen}} of neoneurans, in {{contrast}} to that of protoneurans, is no more slender than that of pond damselflies. Males are mostly brightly coloured with red, orange, yellow and blue predominating, but females are less showy. The females do not bend their relatively short abdomens when laying eggs as do protoneurans. Pairs of these damselfly {{can be seen in}} tandem over quiet waters at the edges of lakes. The eggs are laid among <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> chippings or on emergent plant stems, the male remaining in tandem with the female while ovipositing takes place.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{previous}} investigation on {{the occurrence of}} shipworms in December, 1971 indicated the co-existence of three species of shipworms: Bankia bipalmulata LAMARCK, Teredo navalis LINNAEUS and Lyrodus pedicellatus QUATREFAGES. However, the absence of B. bipalmulata was found in this investigation carried out from February, 1971 to January, 1972. Of these three species, T. navalis was the commonest. In this survey of larval settlement on <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> surfaces, there was no settlement from January to May, and the first settlement of larvae was not observed until June, when water temperature was over 20 °C. The explosive settlement was observed in September. After June, boring damage always occurred when wood blocks were submerged in the sea for over 60 days...|$|R
5000|$|Formerly, {{before the}} {{construction}} of “Government Road” around the lake by the west side, the “lake Traverse” was a key issue to access woodlots upstream (north), located in the Lejeune Township. Winter roads (December to March) allowed the owners of forest lots and forestry contractors to cross the lake on the ice with their cars drawn by horses. In the Spring, boats (or rafts driven by “cageux”) allowed the workers to cross the lake, from the sawmill sector. The <b>floating</b> <b>wood</b> tronc on the lake supplied the sawmill at the mouth. A boat pulled the wood on the lake with a “baune” (floating cable) to bring stranded, downstream from {{the bridge of the}} landfill. The name “Lake Traverse” was formalized on December 5, 1968 in the Bank of place names in Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Québec) ...|$|R
