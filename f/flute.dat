5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo <b>flute</b> called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for <b>flute).</b> This six-holed <b>flute</b> (not unique to the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the <b>flute</b> accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp).

5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse <b>flute.</b> Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because {{it was based on}} that used for <b>flute.</b>|$|E
5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen {{was asked}} to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for <b>flute</b> and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and Vingt regards), the <b>flute</b> piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E

25|$|The lowest sizes (larger {{than the}} bass <b>flute)</b> {{have all been}} {{developed}} in the 20th century; these include the sub-bass <b>flute,</b> which is pitched inF, between the bass and contrabass; subcontrabass <b>flute</b> (pitched in G orC), contra-alto <b>flute</b> (pitched in G, one octave below the alto), and double contrabass <b>flute</b> inC, one octave lower than the contrabass. The <b>flute</b> sizes other than the concert <b>flute</b> and piccolo are sometimes called harmony flutes.|$|E
25|$|This type of <b>flute</b> {{is used in}} many {{ensembles}} including concert bands, military bands, marching bands, orchestras, <b>flute</b> ensembles, {{and occasionally}} jazz bands and big bands.

25|$|Each of {{the above}} {{instruments}} has its own range. The piccolo reads music in C (like the standard <b>flute),</b> but sounds one octave higher. The alto <b>flute</b> is in the key ofG, and the low register extends to the G below middleC; its highest note is a highG (4ledger lines above the treble staff).

Modern flutes may have a longer foot joint, a B-foot, with an extra key to reach B3.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} musical {{instrument}}s, {{other than the}} pipe organ, {{are based on the}} edge tone phenomenon, the most common of which are the <b>flute,</b> the piccolo (a small version of the <b>flute),</b> and the recorder.

50|$|Founded by Kurt Gemeinhardt, a 4th {{generation}} flute-maker in Germany, the Gemeinhardt {{company was}} established in 1948, 20 years after Gemeinhardt’s immigration to the United States. Initially crafting only very fine hand made <b>flutes</b> for professionals, the company expanded in 1952, moving to Elkhart Indiana to produce all levels of silver <b>flutes.</b> Beginner student <b>flutes</b> were developed at this time as well. It was these <b>flutes</b> that eventually became the bread and butter of the corporation as Gemeinhardt’s reputation for fine beginner <b>flutes</b> became {{a hallmark of the}} industry.|$|R

25|$|The <b>flute</b> is {{a family}} of musical {{instruments}} in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a <b>flute</b> is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the <b>flute</b> {{can be referred to}} as a <b>flute</b> player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.|$|E
25|$|In the Baroque era, flutes become used in {{the scores}} of opera, ballet and chamber music. With this, composers wrote music for the <b>flute.</b> These {{included}} Praetorius, Schütz, Rebillé and Descoteaux, Quantz, Bach, Telemann, Blavet, Vivaldi, and Handel. Because {{of the works of}} such composers, the <b>flute</b> became popular as a solo instrument. However, there were few professional flutists who had the <b>flute</b> as their main instrument; many had the oboe. In 1707, Jacques Martin Hotteterre wrote the first method book on playing the flute: Principes de la <b>flûte</b> traversière. The 1730s brought an increase in operatic and chamber music feature of flutes. The end of this era found the publication of Essay of a Method of Playing the Transverse <b>Flute</b> by Quantz, considered the greatest exposition on <b>flute</b> method of its time.|$|E
25|$|The bamboo <b>flute</b> is an {{important}} instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of the Western <b>flute.</b> The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered {{a master of the}} bamboo <b>flute.</b> The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.|$|E
