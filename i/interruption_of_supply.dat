50|$|Following a one-week-long counter-air campaign, {{and due to}} a {{critical}} {{situation on the ground}} in Khuzestan Province, the IRIAF was thrown into the land-battle, mainly in the areas of Khorramshahr, Ahvaz, and Dezful. Here, the IRIAF's performance and superiority over the Iraqi Air Force (IQAF) surprised most informed observers. Its air strikes against armour and supply columns sapped the offensive strength of the Iraqi military. Due to heavy losses in troops and armour, Iranian air superiority and an <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> systems, the Iraqis had to stop their offensive, and then became involved in extremely bitter land-battles against Iranian ground forces. However, the IRIAF paid a heavy price for this success, losing dozens of its best pilots and aircraft in the period between September and December 1980. Although the readiness rates of the IRIAF significantly increased in the following months, its overall role and influence declined, as the clerical government searched to put the emphasis in fighting on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) militias, but also attempted to develop a separate air arm for this service.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} regulating policies for <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> in Sweden and UK. The two regulating regimes have been applied for a case study with a real rural electrical distribution system in Sweden, Flymen. The Swedish and UK regulations state that the distribution system operators (DSO) should restore power delivery to customers within 12 and 18 hours respectively for normal weather conditions. If this could not be fulfilled the DSOs are opposed to different predetermined penalty payments to the customers. In a comparative case study of Flymen the Swedish model (GL) gives a 68 % higher compensation to customers than the UK model (GS) for a 30 hours <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> during normal weather conditions. Historical interruption data for the same system gives a 75 % higher compensation with the Swedish model (GL) than the UK model (GS). The main conclusion from the comparative study is that the Swedish GL model provides a higher compensation for interruptions of supply to customers than the UK GS model. QC 2010112...|$|E

We consider catastrophic, "super-events," which affect many/all suppliers, as well as "unique events" that affect only a single supplier. The probabilities of these events, the financial loss caused by disasters, and the operating cost of working with multiple suppliers are captured by decision trees, from which the expected cost function is obtained and the optimal number of suppliers is determined. Our methodology will help purchasing managers, materials management, as well as academics that are considering such issues.

40|$|Discussion of socio-geographic {{aspects of}} {{renewable}} energy sources in Czechia Abstract Modern society is completely dependent on electricity supplies {{in every aspect of}} life and the economy.

40|$|Abstract: Power system faults {{can cause}} voltage sags that, {{if they are}} less than voltage {{sensitivity}} threshold of equipment, can lead to <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and lead to incurring of financial losses. The impact of distributed generation (DG) on these financial losses is investigated in this work. Using the method of fault positions, a stochastic approach to determine voltage sag performance, profiles of magnitudes of remaining voltages at a monitoring point for faults occurring along lines in the network is developed. It follows that an expected number of critical voltage sags at a monitoring point is calculated and the expected cost of these sags is derived for various voltage sensitivity threshold limits. An illustrative study is carried out comparing the expected costs of voltage sags for a network without DG with a DG case, for various mixes of customers. It is shown that {{in the presence of}} DG, the expected costs of voltage sags are lesser for all voltage sensitivity criteria assumed and for all customer mixes. The study demonstrates that the impact of incorporating DG sources results in a reduction in the expected cost of voltage sags...|$|E

A 3 -phase zigzag-winding transformer connected across a 3 -phase load may mitigate the voltage sag or swell at any one phase of the load. The phase subjected to voltage sag or swell is disconnected from the source first, while the two healthy phases remain connected to the source. The zigzag transformer immediately rebuilds the voltage across the load of the open phase and allows the current to flow to the open phase load. Very low value of zero sequence impedance of the zigzag transformer produces very small voltage drop and the open phase voltage nearly equals the normal voltage.

40|$|Abstract: Voltage sags {{are caused}} by faults which cause {{equipment}} trips. Different equipment have voltage sensitivity thresholds, and when voltage sags are below that specific threshold, they can lead to <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> and as a result, they will result in financial losses. In this dissertation, the impact of distributed generation (DG) on voltage sag performance is investigated. Using a stochastic approach, voltage sag performance is assessed by using a method of fault position to determine profiles of magnitudes of remaining voltages at a monitoring point. From these, the expected number of critical voltage sags at a monitoring point are calculated, and the expected cost of these sags is derived for various voltage sensitivity threshold limits. An illustrative study is carried out comparing the voltage sag performance and expected costs of voltage sags for a network without DG and a DG Case for various mixes of customers. It was shown that {{in the presence of}} DG, the expected number of critical voltage sags was lower for all voltage sensitivity criteria assumed and for all customer mixes. In addition, the expected costs of voltage sags were fewer for all voltage sensitivity criteria.
