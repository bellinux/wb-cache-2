5|$|Gary Steven Roberts (born 2 February 1987) is an English footballer {{who plays}} for National League North club Southport. A <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, {{he has been}} praised for his vision and ball {{distribution}} skills. However off the field he has struggled to control drink and gambling problems.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a <b>deep-lying</b> midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, {{physical}} attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder. Instead, his reading of the game helps him anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, {{most of the time}} by covering space and making interceptions. His distribution of the ball, creativity, and range of passing, which are among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe, add to his importance in dictating the tempo of the game, as well as initiating team attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all the more remarkable. Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a <b>deep-lying,</b> left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Because of this, he {{was later}} moved to a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker role by his coaches Mazzone, Fatih Terim, and Ancelotti, where {{he was able to}} excel due to his unique capabilities. This {{position}} best utilised Pirlo's attributes, and allowed him to operate creatively from a deeper position, in or even behind the main midfield line, in a seemingly defensive midfield role, where he was allowed more time on the ball to create scoring opportunities with his trademark long balls. During his final season with Milan, Pirlo was also used on the wing under Allegri, due to his ability to provide accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using <b>deep-lying</b> midfielders, as he noted that most of the Ireland international players plied their trade in England. Crucially he instructed all members of his team to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall {{introduced}} a new tactical system using a <b>deep-lying</b> centre-forward, which {{became known as the}} Revie Plan after Don Revie who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.|$|E
5|$|Totti is {{regarded}} as one of the most talented Italian players of all time, and by some as Italy's greatest player ever. Throughout his career, Totti played predominantly as a classic number 10, functioning either as an offensive-midfield playmaker or as a supporting or <b>deep-lying</b> forward behind the main striker; only in the later years of his Roma career was he mainly employed as a lone striker. An elegant, world-class, and technically gifted attacking midfielder with a good knowledge of the game, Totti was a tactically versatile player, capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and was also occasionally deployed as a winger or as a central midfield playmaker under Zdeněk Zeman, and most notably as a false-9 under Luciano Spalletti and Rudi García.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or <b>deep-lying</b> forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} Iceland on 3 July, at the Stade de France, Pogba {{was able to}} {{recapture}} his form, putting on a dominant performance in his new midfield role, as he scored his nation's second goal of the night from a header following Antoine Griezmann's corner, which he had previously helped to obtain; he later started the play which led to Griezmann's goal, as the host nation advanced to the semi-finals of the competition following a 5–2 win. In the semi-final match against Germany four days later, Pogba was once again started in a <b>deep-lying</b> midfield role alongside Blaise Matuidi in a 4–2–3–1 formation; following N'Golo Kanté's introduction in the second half, he was shifted to a more advanced role, which gave him more tactical freedom, and he subsequently helped to create Griezmann's second goal of the match, as the hosts defeated the reigning World Cup Champions 2–0 {{to advance to the}} final of the tournament, where they suffered a 1–0 extra-time defeat to Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, Pirlo {{was capable}} of playing in several midfield positions, but was usually {{deployed}} by his club and national sides as a central midfielder, {{in the role of}} a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, due to his vision and passing accuracy. A highly technical and creative player, Pirlo is regarded by players, managers, and pundits {{as one of the greatest}} ever players in his position, as one of the best midfielders in the world and of his generation, and as one of the greatest Italian players of all time. He started his career in a more advanced role, as an offensive midfielder, and also played as a supporting striker on occasion. Although he was considered a talented young prospect, even drawing comparisons with former Italian footballer Gianni Rivera, Pirlo occasionally struggled in this role, due to his lack of pace, and competition from other talented and more dynamic players in his position.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, <b>deep-lying</b> snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E
5|$|A complete, consistent, hardworking and {{versatile}} midfielder, Alonso {{is regarded as}} one of the best players of his generation, and is effective both creatively and defensively. Gifted with good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excels in the centre in a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaking role, where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he is an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions. In addition to his creative attributes, he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He has at times been criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{performances}} with Brescia, Pirlo {{was spotted}} by Inter coach Mircea Lucescu, {{who signed the}} playmaker. Pirlo was unable {{to break into the}} first squad permanently, however, and Inter finished eighth in the 1998–99 Serie A campaign. Inter loaned Pirlo to Reggina for the 1999–2000 season, alongside young Inter teammates Roberto Baronio and Mohamed Kallon. After an impressive season, he returned to Inter but was once again unable to break into the first team, making just four league appearances. He spent {{the second half of the}} 2000–01 season on loan at his former club, Brescia, where he played alongside his childhood idol, offensive playmaker Roberto Baggio. As Baggio occupied the attacking midfield role for Brescia, manager Carlo Mazzone made a ground-breaking decision, becoming the first coach to deploy Pirlo as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, rather than as an offensive midfielder, a deeper creative role in which he particularly excelled, due to his long passing ability. Despite initially struggling against relegation that season, Brescia would eventually manage a comfortable seventh-place finish in Serie A, also reaching the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, qualifying for the 2001 Intertoto Cup. A notable moment in Pirlo's Brescia career was his long pass which assisted Baggio's late equaliser against Juventus at the Stadio delle Alpi, on 1 April 2001.|$|E
5|$|Following Pirlo's {{departure}} from Milan in 2011, Juventus signed {{him on a}} free transfer on a contract until 2014. His debut with Juventus was in a friendly match against Sporting Clube de Portugal, which they lost 2–1. His first competitive match with Juventus was the Serie A opening match against Parma at home, in which tallied two assists, for Stephan Lichtsteiner and Claudio Marchisio, and completed 110 passes in a 4–1 victory. Antonio Conte played him alongside younger midfielders Marchisio and new signing Arturo Vidal in a three-man midfield, which allowed Pirlo to function creatively as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, while Marchisio and Vidal supported him defensively. Pirlo's first goal for Juventus was a free kick against Catania on 18 February 2012 securing a 3–1 victory for Juventus and put the club back {{at the top of}} the Serie A table, above his former side Milan. On 18 March, Pirlo scored in a 5–0 demolition of Fiorentina and after the game dedicated the win to Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest playing for Bolton Wanderers during a match against Tottenham Hotspur the same day.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years at Marseille, Nasri was {{deployed}} in several positions, most notably as a <b>deep-lying</b> midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily {{on the right side}} as he was deemed too small to play {{in the middle of the}} park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006–07 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally admitted that playing centrally is his preference. However, as a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4–3–3 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Arsène Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc Fàbregas.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo {{began his}} club {{career as an}} attacking midfielder with his home-town side Brescia, where he later helped the team to win the Serie B title and obtain Serie A {{promotion}} in 1997. His promising performances led to a move to Internazionale in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club due to his lack of pace as well as heavy competition with other players in his position and was subsequently sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with Reggina and Brescia once again, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals Milan in 2001. At Milan, manager Carlo Ancelotti decided to shift Pirlo {{in front of the}} defence as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, which allowed him more time on the ball to orchestrate his team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in his new role and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, playing a key role in Milan's subsequent successes, as he won two UEFA Champions Leagues (2003 and 2007), two UEFA Super Cups (2003 and 2007), two Serie A titles (2004 and 2011), a FIFA Club World Cup (2007), a Supercoppa Italiana (2004) and a Coppa Italia (2003) with the club. After joining Juventus on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015), which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles (2012 and 2013) and a Coppa Italia (2015). After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined MLS expansion side New York City FC in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons. In November 2017, Pirlo retired {{at the end of the}} MLS season.|$|E
5|$|Totti did recuperate in {{time and}} was {{eventually}} named to Lippi's final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup. Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi's team, and played in all seven games for Italy, including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute. He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that {{had yet to be}} removed following the surgery. Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield. Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with his teammate Pirlo, Juan Román Riquelme, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Luís Figo (4). Totti set up Pirlo's goal from a short corner in Italy's opening 2–0 win against Ghana, Marco Materazzi's goal from a corner in Italy's final group match, a 2–0 win against the Czech Republic, and two goals in a 3–0 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni's goals. Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy's 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June, and was involved in Del Piero's last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2–0 victory for the Italians over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final. Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots; in recognition of a successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the duties}} of {{defensive}} midfielders are primarily defensive, some midfielders are deployed as <b>deep-lying</b> playmakers, due {{to their ability to}} dictate tempo from a deep position with their passing. Sometimes a defensive midfielder will be paired with a central midfielder who will act as the <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker. When ever the central midfielder ventures forward the defensive midfielder will hold back.|$|E
25|$|Playmakers are midfielders that {{controls}} the flow of attacking play, starting off attacking moves. They have good passing ability and also good off-the-ball ability and vision {{to be able to}} read the game and to see where goal-scoring opportunities may come from. Playmakers usually play as central midfielders or attacking midfielders, but some play as defensive midfielders (known as <b>deep-lying</b> playmakers).|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the W–M formation was the M–U formation used to great effect by the Hungary national team against England in 1953, when they became the first non-British side to beat England at the old Wembley Stadium. This formation was so-called because of the <b>deep-lying</b> centre-forward Nándor Hidegkuti, used to draw the opposition centre-back out of position, leaving plenty of space between the full-backs for the inside-forwards Ferenc Puskás and Sándor Kocsis to exploit.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel. They {{also need to}} possess good passing skills and close control to hold the ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. <b>Deep-lying</b> playmakers typically require a good first touch under opposition pressure {{and the ability to}} play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.|$|E
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} players in his position, Rijkaard was a quick, strong, complete and tenacious defensive midfielder who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute tactical intelligence and decision-making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game. Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Rijkaard was a strong tackler, with good technique and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker once he won back possession. He also possessed a powerful shot.|$|E
25|$|Discontinuous sand bodies at {{the base}} of the McMurray Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of northeastern Alberta, Canada, are {{commonly}} referred to as the Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers. Saturated with water, they are confined beneath impermeable bitumen-saturated sands that are exploited to recover bitumen for synthetic crude oil production. Where they are <b>deep-lying</b> and recharge occurs from underlying Devonian formations they are saline, and where they are shallow and recharged by meteoric water they are non-saline. The BWS typically pose problems for the recovery of bitumen, whether by open-pit mining or by in situ methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), and in some areas they are targets for waste-water injection.|$|E
25|$|The 1955 FA Cup Final was contested by Newcastle United and Manchester City at Wembley. Newcastle won 3–1, with goals from Jackie Milburn in {{the first}} minute (after 45 seconds, a record in a final at Wembley, a record he held until 1997), Bobby Mitchell and George Hannah. Bobby Johnstone scored City's goal. The game was {{virtually}} decided when Man City fullback Meadows was turned inside out by the elusive and mercurial Bobby Mitchell and after 22 minutes was stretchered off with a bad leg injury and City were down to 10 men as no substitutes were permitted in the 1950s. Whilst City's much-vaunted Revie Plan (based on a <b>deep-lying</b> centre-forward in Don Revie) failed to fire.|$|E
25|$|Gerrard {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} wide midfielder on the right, {{although he did not}} excel in this position as he had a tendency to commit careless fouls in his youth. Nevertheless, Liverpool retained their faith in the youngster, and he was later shifted to a defensive midfield position as he matured, where he excelled as a ball-winner rather than as a playmaker. He continued to evolve tactically, coming into his own in a box-to-box central midfield role, which allowed him to be effective both offensively and defensively. Under Benítez, he was also used in a supporting and creative role, as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers, or even as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker.|$|E
25|$|Upon Modrić's arrival to Real Madrid, his midfield {{position}} {{was described as}} numbers six (defensive), eight (central) or ten (attacking), depending on the tactics, and his role was described as the second <b>deep-lying</b> pivot alongside Xabi Alonso in the 2012–13 season, a classic <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker whose creativity was needed to dictate his team's play and unlock the opposing defence. In {{the first half of}} the 2013–14 season, during which he formed an effective central midfield partnership with Alonso and Angel di Maria, Modrić made more tackles (56) than any other Real Madrid player in La Liga, with an average number of 2.86 tackles per league game, as well as making the most completed passes (878) in the opposition half of the pitch among Real Madrid players, with the highest passing accuracy in the league (90%), which was also the highest of any midfielder in Europe's top five leagues who have made five or more assists during the season. In the 2014–15 season, with the arrival of Toni Kroos, Real Madrid no longer had an effective and natural ball-winner alongside their playmakers in midfield, while the team possessed many attackers; therefore, in addition to producing the highest count of passes (60.7–64.7) and key passes per game (0.8–1.2) within the team, both Modrić and Kroos had more defensive responsibility to set the rhythm of the team's gameplay in midfield and orchestrate counterattacks. Modrić's average passing accuracy during the season was between 91.6–92%, while the highest completion rate he managed in a single match occurred in October against Barcelona when completed 100% of his 42 attempted passes. In whole 2014, Modrić's dribble attempts (75) at a success rate of 76% were second in Europe's top five leagues.|$|E
25|$|Bothriolepis had {{a slender}} trunk that was likely covered in soft skin with no scales or markings. The {{orientation}} {{that appears to}} have been most stable for resting was dorsal surface up, evidenced by the flat surface on the ventral side. The trunk’s outline suggests {{that there may have been}} a notochord present surrounded by a membranous sheath, however there is no direct evidence of this since the notochord is made up of soft tissue, which is not typically preserved in the fossil record. Similar to other antiarchs, the thoracic shield of Bothriolepis was attached to its heavily armored head. Its box-like body was enclosed in armor plates, providing protection from predators. Attached to the ventral surface of the trunk is a large, thin, circular plate marked by <b>deep-lying</b> lines and superficial ridges. This plate lies just below the opening to the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|He spent around £15million on winger Gianluigi Lentini, {{breaking}} the world football transfer record. He also signed Fernando De Napoli, Stefano Eranio, Jean-Pierre Papin, Dejan Savićević and Zvonimir Boban. Already boasting talent such as Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Paolo Maldini and Frank Rijkaard, Capello {{was one of}} the first managers to introduce a squad rotation approach. He played Rijkaard and Albertini as <b>deep-lying</b> central midfielders, allowing his wingers more license to attack. Milan dominated the league in the 1992–93 season, defending the Serie A title, and reached the 1993 UEFA Champions League final, losing to 1–0 Marseille. Milan remained unbeaten for 58 league games, between 19 May 1991 and 21 March 1993, which included an entire season in the league, a record in Italian football. They were finally defeated 1–0 by Parma after a goal from Faustino Asprilla.|$|E
25|$|The {{switch to}} a more <b>deep-lying</b> {{position}} reduced his number of assists and goals, {{as well as his}} shot per game count (1.2), although his game was no longer based on being a goal threat; in spite of this, he had the second highest count of key passes per game (2.06) in the team, as well as a very high pass accuracy rate (87%), with the highest passes per game count (62.5) in the team, the most long balls per game (5.6), the most successful dribbles (2.2), interceptions (2.5), and the highest tackle (1.9) count per game among others, high statistics which placed him amongst the top midfielders on of the Premier League. Already in the 2011–12 season statistically he was among top rated central and all-round midfielders across the top five leagues, alongside players like Xabi Alonso, Andrea Pirlo, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Xavi.|$|E
25|$|Kovačić {{has been}} {{described}} as a great technician with excellent dribbling abilities. He is considered to be a versatile midfielder, having played in different midfield positions. He started off as an attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb, but he transformed his game at Inter where he was deployed out wide and also as a central midfielder, functioning as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, while being coached by Andrea Stramaccioni. One of his trademarks is dropping deep to receive the ball and then driving forward, often performing his slalom runs. Under the coach, Walter Mazzarri, he was often used in a more advanced position. Former Italy and Inter Milan manager Giovanni Trapattoni once claimed that Kovačić knows how to really reach the ball from deep and drive up the pitch like a 'raging bull'. Proven by his pass completion percentages, Kovačić is known for distributing the ball up the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Modrić's complex {{game has}} brought him {{consistent}} {{success in the}} clubs for which he has played. Initially a trequartista or attacking midfielder at Dinamo Zagreb and in his early career at Tottenham, in the 2010–11 season he flourished in a central midfield role as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker (regista) who conducts the attack and creates chances for teammates. Although a central midfielder, Modrić is also a hard-working player who has been seen to adopt a defensive midfield role in addition to playmaking, tracking back to win the ball from the opposition and prepare for a counter-attack, making {{him one of the}} most versatile players in the world, capable of playing in several midfield positions. According to Jonathan Wilson, in a 4–2–3–1 system Modrić is a third type of a holding midfielder, being neither entirely a destroyer or a creator, but a carrier who is capable of making late runs or carrying the ball at his feet, but in his case with a hint of regista.|$|E
25|$|A quick, {{intelligent}} and talented midfielder, {{known for his}} pace on the ball, Laudrup is {{regarded as one of}} the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. Although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. Laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. He was ranked among the best players in Europe, with the French three time European footballer of the year award winner Michel Platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. Despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.|$|E
25|$|Capello {{was signed}} by Paolo Mazza, the President of SPAL, for the fee of two million lire despite {{interest}} from Milan. In his second season in the youth team, he helped the club win the Italian Youth Championship and made his first-team debut against Sampdoria on 29 March 1964. A talented and tactically intelligent holding midfielder, with a good positional sense, he could read the play well and was strong both {{in the air and}} in the tackle, in spite of his lack of notable height and unorthodox physique; he usually operated as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker in midfield, however, due to his outstanding technique and vision, which enabled him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves or create chances for teammates, and was an excellent passer of the ball with both feet. Going forward he was also equally effective, and possessed an eye for goal from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate shot, as well as his ability at penalty kicks, but he lacked pace, and was notorious for not being particularly hard-working. With SPAL, he made four appearances for a struggling side that was relegated from Serie A. After returning to the top division at the first attempt, Capello became a key player in the 1965–66 season, taking penalties and helping them avoid a swift return to Serie B. He was also called up to the Italian under-23 side alongside teammate Edoardo Reja despite still being a teenager. However, injury to his left knee restricted him to just 16 appearances the following season.|$|E
500|$|Alessandro [...] "Alex" [...] Del Piero (...) Ufficiale OMRI (born 9 November 1974) is an Italian former {{professional}} footballer who mainly played as a <b>deep-lying</b> forward, {{although he was}} capable of playing in several offensive positions. Since 2015, he has worked as a pundit for Sky Sport Italia.|$|E
500|$|Andrea Pirlo, Ufficiale OMRI ( [...] ; born 19 May 1979) is an Italian former {{professional}} footballer. Pirlo {{was usually}} deployed as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker in midfield for both his club and national sides {{and he is}} widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest ever exponents of this position due to his vision, ball control, creativity and passing ability, as well as for being a free-kick specialist.|$|E
500|$|It was at Milan, in {{particular}} under manager Carlo Ancelotti, where Pirlo made big strides in developing {{into a world}} class player, {{and one of the}} best <b>deep-lying</b> playmakers and set-piece specialists in the world, as he went on to achieve notable domestic and international success during his time with the club. Pirlo later recalled the period he has spent in Milan with Ancelotti: [...] "He changed my career, putting me in front of the defence. We shared some unforgettable moments. We had a magnificent past together." [...] After Mazzone's pioneering decision to move Pirlo into a deep-seated playmaking role with Brescia during the previous season, Milan managers Fatih Terim and, {{in particular}}, Carlo Ancelotti further developed this role for him at Milan. In Ancelotti's 4–3–1–2 and 4–3–2–1 formations, Pirlo was deployed as a <b>deep-lying</b> playmaker in front of the defence, which allowed him to play alongside other talented attacking midfielders, such as Rivaldo, Rui Costa and eventually Kaká, replacing the gap left by Milan legend Demetrio Albertini in the deep midfield playmaking role. He would become an integral part of the Rossoneri's midfield, forming a formidable partnership with Gennaro Gattuso, as well as with Clarence Seedorf and Massimo Ambrosini, who also supported his playmaking role defensively. Pirlo was given the nickname the metronome during his time at the club, for the way in which he set the team's rhythm.|$|E
