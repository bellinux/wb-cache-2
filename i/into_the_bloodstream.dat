5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} later takes a mysterious turn as it shows no {{connection}} between the lower alien forms and higher alien forms. Eventually, however, it is found {{the leaders of the}} invasion are the Micronoids, a race of sapient single-celled organisms that live in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> of <b>the</b> other aliens; the ultimate goal of the invasion is to inject Micronoids <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> of important figures, allowing them to control Mega-Primus through psionic domination of their hosts. The player is eventually tasked with invading the aliens' homeworld and destroying their side of the gate as the only way to stop the Micronoid infestation.|$|R
5|$|Electronic cigarette: Hon Lik, a Chinese pharmacist, is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} modern electronic cigarette. In 2003, he {{came up with the idea}} of using a piezoelectric ultrasound-emitting element to vaporise a pressurized jet of liquid containing nicotine diluted in a propylene glycol solution.This design produces a smoke-like vapour that can be inhaled and provides a vehicle for nicotine delivery <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> via the lungs. He also proposed using propylene glycol to dilute nicotine and placing it in a disposable plastic cartridge which serves as a liquid reservoir and mouthpiece.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E
2500|$|... cffDNA {{originates}} {{from the}} trophoblasts {{making up the}} placenta. An average of 11%-13.4% of cell-free DNA in maternal blood is of fetal origin, although this varies widely amongst patients. The fetal DNA is fragmented and makes its way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream</b> via shedding of <b>the</b> placental microparticles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream</b> (figure 1). Studies have shown that cffDNA can first be observed as early as 7 weeks gestation, {{and the amount of}} cffDNA increases as the pregnancy progresses. cffDNA diminishes quickly after the birth of the baby, so that it is no longer detectable in the maternal blood approximately 2 hours after birth. cffDNA fragments are significantly smaller than the maternal DNA fragments in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> with cffDNA fragments being approximately 200bp (base pairs) in size. Many protocols to extract the fetal DNA from the maternal plasma use its size to distinguish it from the maternal DNA.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{function of}} such secretions {{may have been}} to suppress the immune system of the host (see above). The trematode Schistosoma mansoni secretes opioid peptides <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hosts <b>bloodstream,</b> influencing both its immune response and neural function.

5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> There {{is evidence}} that the beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> This usually lasts {{two to three}} days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
50|$|A retinal {{haemorrhage}} {{is generally}} diagnosed {{by using an}} ophthalmoscope or fundus camera {{in order to examine}} the inside of the eye.

50|$|The adult worms, {{which usually}} {{stay in one}} tissue, release early larval forms known as microfilariae <b>into</b> <b>the</b> host's <b>bloodstream.</b> These {{circulating}} microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host.|$|R
50|$|People have {{no trouble}} digesting {{chlorine}} or chloramine at the levels found in public drinking water; this water is not introduced directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> human <b>bloodstream.</b> In <b>the</b> United States, the United States Environmental Protection Agency set minimum and maximum health-based safe levels for chloramine in drinking water. Elsewhere, similar oversight agencies may set drinking water quality standards for chloramine.|$|R
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but {{little is known about}} absorption rates in children.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional hearings for passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b>|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E

25|$|Most hip {{replacements}} {{consist of}} cobalt and chromium alloys, or titanium. Stainless steel {{is no longer}} used. All implants release their constituent ions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blood. Typically these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of cobalt and chromium can be absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> patient's <b>bloodstream.</b> There are reports of cobalt toxicity with hip replacement patients.|$|R
5000|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography and Positron emission tomography. SPECT and PET use radioactive isotopes, which are injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> subject's <b>bloodstream</b> and {{taken up by}} the brain. By observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope, we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas. PET has similar spatial resolution to fMRI, but it has extremely poor temporal resolution.|$|R
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
25|$|As an {{isolated}} molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in water; it dissolves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> (water-based) <b>bloodstream</b> only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, cholesterol is transported within lipoproteins, complex discoidal particles with exterior amphiphilic proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via emulsification. Triglycerides and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer {{surface of the}} lipoprotein particle.|$|R
40|$|It is in a child’s best {{interests}} for a prospective mother not to drink alcohol while pregnant {{due to the}} risk of damaging the physical and mental development of the unborn child – damage which can have serious, life-long consequences.
