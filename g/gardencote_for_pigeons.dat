50|$|In Spain, pigeon eating was {{a common}} {{practice}} {{as early as the}} 14th century under the 1379 Order of the Pigeon created by King Juan I of Castile.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{estimate}} growth pattern and examine the best ARIMA model to efficiently forecasting pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production in Bangladesh. It appeared that the time series data <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea were 1 st order homogenous stationary. Two types of models namely Box-Jenkins type Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and deterministic type growth models, are examined to identify the best forecasting models <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production in Bangladesh. The study revealed that the best models were ARIMA (1, 1 and 1), ARIMA (0, 1 and 0) and ARIMA (1, 1 and 3) <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production, respectively. Among the deterministic type growth models, the cubic model is best <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production. The analysis indicated that short-term forecasts were more efficient for ARIMA models compared to the deterministic models. The production uncertainty of pulse could be minimized if production were forecasted well and necessary steps were taken against losses. The {{findings of this study}} would be more useful for policy makers, researchers as well as producers in order to forecast future national pulse production more accurately in the short run...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Yolks of pigeon and {{guinea fowl}} eggs were {{examined}} {{for the number}} of dichromate-staining rings. Estimates of the time for rapid follicular development using this technique were 5. 1 and 5. 6 days <b>for</b> <b>pigeons</b> and guinea fowl, respectively. Another measure of follicular development based on the incor-poration of Sudan dyes into the yolk yielded an estimate of 6. 5 and 8. 3 days <b>for</b> <b>pigeons</b> and guinea fowl, respectively. Using one and two-egg clutches, no differences due to clutch position were observed in either species. There was a significant difference (P=s. 01) between results obtained with the two techniques for measuring the period of rapid yolk deposition. The dichromate technique can give valuable data relative to yolk deposition, especially in species where it is impractical to daily catch and administer Sudan dyes. But the tendency to underestimate the period of follicular growth means that caution must be exercised in comparing results obtained with that technique and the more labor-intensive Sudan dye incorporation method. The time from the end of yolk deposition until oviposition is defined as the rest period. This interval was 1. 5 days <b>for</b> <b>pigeons</b> and 1. 7 days for guinea fowl. This is considerably longer than the rest period of Coturnix quail but similar to that found in turkeys and chickens...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—Pigeon breeder's {{disease is}} an {{extrinsic}} allergic alveolitis in the lungs of sensitised people, caused by hypersensitivity reactions to inhaled pigeon antigens. Antigens from different sources of the animal are used for diagnostic purposes, with serum being the most widely used. Bloom is rarely used; very little is known of its antigenicity and diagnostic performance, particularly when used with the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, {{which is the most}} popular test as it permits measurement of the antibody response.  METHODS—To (a) standardise an ELISA for the measurement of specific IgG against pigeon serum and pigeon bloom extract; (b) to establish reference values for specific IgG in 73  non-exposed controls, (c) to show the presence of specific IgG against pigeon serum and bloom in serum samples of 17  patients with bird fancier's lung and 11  asymptomatic fanciers, and (d) to study the similarity of the two antigen sources by cross reactivity experiments.  RESULTS—Reference values of specific IgG were defined with the 97. 5  percentile (367. 9  U/ml <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> serum and 953. 7  U/ml <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> bloom extract). Of symptomatic patients 100 % had values higher than the cut off for both antigens. In asymptomatic fanciers values were higher than the cut off <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> serum in 45 % and bloom extract in 54 %. Cross reactivity experiments showed that the two antigens differed in antigenic content although some components may be common to both.  CONCLUSION—The ELISA methods used proved to be useful tools for evaluating specific IgG antibody responses against both antigens. The diagnostic performance of both ELISA methods performed with these antigen sources was similar, showing very high sensitivity but moderate specificity. Although some antigenic similarity was found between pigeon serum and bloom extract, cross reactivity studies showed that various antigens seemed to be specific to the bloom extract. However, the antigens responsible <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> breeder's disease seem to be present in both antigenic sources.    Keywords: antibodies; pigeons; ELIS...|$|R
