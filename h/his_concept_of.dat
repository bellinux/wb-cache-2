5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E

5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from their spouses in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|From late August 1869 to May the {{following}} year, Levski {{was active in}} the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter. In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an internal revolutionary network.|$|E
5|$|His The Method of Sociology first {{introduced}} <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books {{published in the}} same year (1952): Modern Nationalities, and Cultural Sciences. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his magnum opus, Systematic Sociology, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology (1965).|$|E
50|$|He is also vice {{secretary-general}} of the UNESCO China-MAB (Man and the Biosphere) Committee {{and a member of}} the UNESCO MAB Urban Group. He is known for <b>his</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> “urban vegetation” and allowing damaged ecosystems to recover naturally.|$|R
25|$|Bourdieu's work {{is built}} upon {{an attempt to}} transcend a series of oppositions which he thought {{characterized}} the social sciences (subjectivism/objectivism, micro/macro, freedom/determinism) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time. <b>His</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> habitus, capital, and field were conceived {{with the intention of}} overcoming such oppositions.|$|R
5000|$|As {{his books}} became more accepted, and <b>his</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "media virus" [...] and [...] "social contagion" [...] became {{mainstream}} ideas, Rushkoff {{was invited to}} deliver commentaries on National Public Radio's All Things Considered, and to make documentaries for the PBS series Frontline.|$|R
5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E
5000|$|Chapman's {{preoccupation with}} this <b>concept,</b> <b>of</b> the virtuous {{man who is}} his own moral authority, connects with his deep {{commitment}} to Homer, whose works he translated over many years; and it helps to explain why Chapman would soon abandon comedy, to devote himself to the tragedies in which he explored <b>his</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Homeric Idealism" [...] more deeply.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the key {{questions raised by}} its title—what should we understand by the terms virtuality, humanity, and, thereby, by the term reality? These questions are explored {{with reference to the}} work of philosophers such as Henri Bergson, and <b>his</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> perception and moral obligation, and Michel Foucault, and <b>his</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> discourse, power, and epistemic shifts in history. These philosophical backgrounds then underpin the more recent theorizing of thinkers such as Karen Barad, Stephen Gill, and Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, whose agential realism and neo-Gramscianism together constitute a broad picture within which the material manifestation of our dreams can be better understood. The chapter concludes that virtuality is consciousness, but that the freedom to choose implicit in this equation must be fought for, generation after generation...|$|R
5|$|In this respect, Traherne's work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the abounding joy and mysticism found {{in the works of}} William Blake, Walt Whitman, and Gerard Manley Hopkins. According to Traherne scholar Denise Inge, Traherne's introduction of a child's viewpoint to narrate his theological and moral premises was unknown or certainly unappreciated in the literature of this time. His poems frequently explore the glory of creation and what he perceived as his intimate relationship with God. He drew deeply on the writings of Aristotle and on the early Church Fathers for <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Man and human nature. Little mention is made of sin and suffering in the works that have dominated 20th-century criticism, and some critics have seen his verse as bordering upon pantheism (or perhaps panentheism).|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{knowledge}} of plant anatomy, morphology and life cycles {{led to the}} realisation {{that there were more}} natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. Adanson (1763), de Jussieu (1789), and Candolle (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The Candollean system reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the later classification by Bentham and Hooker, which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. Darwin's publication of the Origin of Species in 1859 and <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.|$|E
5|$|Before he died, Bolesław III Wrymouth {{divided the}} country, {{in a limited}} sense, among four of his sons. He made complex {{arrangements}} intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Bolesław's death, {{the implementation of the}} plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> seniorate, Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Kraków. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Kraków, was {{to be added to the}} senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Kraków, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when Władysław II the Exile, Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II the Just fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Kraków.|$|E

5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, even taking {{time away from}} film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and <b>his</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been desensitized by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E
