500|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, the Northern Isles were Christianised by King Olaf Tryggvasson in 995 when {{he stopped}} at South Walls {{on his way to}} Ireland from Norway. The King summoned jarl Sigurd and said [...] "I order you and all your {{subjects}} to be baptised.

500|$|The {{success of}} the {{television}} series The Darling Buds of May (199193) made Zeta-Jones a popular celebrity in Britain, and her personal life has since been chronicled by the media. Her relationships in the early 1990s with the television personality John Leslie, the singer David Essex, and the pop star Mick Hucknall were widely reported by the British press. In the mid-1990s she was briefly engaged to the Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen. In {{an interview with the}} Daily Mirror in 1995, she described her lifestyle: [...] "I drink, <b>I</b> <b>swear,</b> <b>I</b> like sex".|$|E
500|$|The islands {{converted}} to Christianity {{in the late}} 10th century. King Olav Tryggvasson summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout {{during a visit to}} Orkney and said, [...] "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>I</b> will ravage every island with fire and steel." [...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke. Unusually, from c. 1100 onwards the Norse jarls owed allegiance both to Norway and to the Scottish crown through their holdings as Earls of Caithness.|$|E
500|$|Initially a pagan culture, {{detailed}} information about the turn to the Christian religion to the islands of Scotland during the Norse-era is elusive.

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion {{at the end of the}} tenth century. There are a relatively large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a [...] "hermit's" [...] or [...] "priest's isle" [...] from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and the use of Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that the Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion. According to the Orkneyinga Saga the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway.

[...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century and there is then a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079.|$|E

[...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop, Henry of Lund (also known as [...] "the Fat"), who was appointed sometime prior to 1035. The greatest source of Scottish influence after the appointment of the Scottish earls in the 13th century was probably through the church, although {{it is clear that}} Scots influence on the culture of Orkney and Shetland was fairly limited until the close of the 14th century or later. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves Communitas Orchadensis and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords, be they Norwegian or Scots. This independence of mind may have been fostered by the influence of Norwegian government which was essentially communal and federal by contrast with Scotland. It was not until the mid 16th century that the Norse institutions were replaced by Scottish systems following large-scale immigration from the south [...] and the islanders were probably bi-lingual until the 17th century.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice", {{the first}} song of the album, {{contains}} [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section according to IGNs Ed Thompson. The main theme of the song is recovery from an abusive relationship, which also inspired all of the songs on Fallen. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian and Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the song was written for Evanescence's former guitarist Ben Moody. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is a rock song that starts as a piano ballad before quickly becoming an alternative metal song that uses elements of nu metal, symphonic rock and pop music. Lee said she wrote the song for her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan of South African alternative metal band Seether. Described as a [...] "chick anthem", the song's protagonist explains the reasons {{the relationship between the}} pair will not work through the lyrics [...] "Don't cry to me…If you loved me, you would be here with me /...How could I have burned paradise? How could I…you were never mine". [...] "Weight of the World" [...] is a mixture of pop and metal, according to Stornoway Gazette. Inspired by the pressures of fame, it contains [...] "Eastern motifs" [...] and [...] "distorted vocals" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Feels like {{the weight of the world}} / Like God in heaven gave me a turn / Don't cling to me, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>I</b> can't fix you" [...] and in the chorus, [...] "If you love me, then let go of me / I won't be held down by who I used to be".|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>I</b> wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the real question that she and her songwriters is presenting on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world". He further wrote that none of them are impressive." ...|$|E
500|$|While the {{official}} conversion of Scandinavian Scotland {{took place at}} the end of the tenth century, there is evidence that Christianity had already made inroads into the Viking controlled Highland and Islands. There are a large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a [...] "hermit's" [...] or [...] "priest's isle" [...] from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that Christianity had begun to spread before {{the official}} conversion. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, not written down until around 1230, the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson, king of Norway, in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the local jarl Sigurd the Stout and said [...] "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>I</b> will ravage every island with fire and steel". The story may be apocryphal, but the islands became officially Christian, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. The bishopric appears to have been under the authority of the Archbishops of York and of Hamburg-Bremen at different points before the twelfth century and from then until 1472 it was subordinate to the Archbishop of Nidaros (today's Trondheim). Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century, followed by a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079. One of the major effects of the conversion of the Vikings was to bring an end to plundering raids on Christian sites, which may have allowed them to recover some of their status as cultural and intellectual centres. It also probably curbed the excesses of Viking violence and led to a more settled society in northern Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'.

2500|$|Several documentaries have {{attempted}} to portray Tourette's syndrome accurately and to advocate for greater understanding of persons with Tourette's, while others focus on sensationalizing coprolalia. The Emmy Award-winning television documentary film I Have Tourette's but Tourette's Doesn't Have Me was produced by HBO {{in conjunction with the}} Tourette Syndrome Association, featuring {{children between the ages of}} six and 13. It was described by the Cincinnati Enquirer as [...] "the best simple overview yet of Tourette's". John's Not Mad (1989) and The Boy Can't Help It (2000) are documentaries about a young man from Scotland, who has severe Tourette's and coprolalia. Twitch and Shout examines a society that is quick to judge a person who strays outside the limits of conventional behavior and was nominated for an Emmy. A 2007 British documentary, Tourette De France, followed a group of teenagers with Tourette's on a trip to Paris; many of the teenagers featured in the program had coprolalia. Movements and Madness: Gusti Ayu is a documentary about the struggles of a young woman with severe Tourette's in a small village in Indonesia. A 2011 BBC documentary, Tourettes: <b>I</b> <b>Swear</b> <b>I</b> Can Sing, followed aspiring musician Ruth Ojadi as she explains her experience of TS and her struggle to find self-confidence in her singing.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for me, {{for the first time}} in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>I</b> couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E
