5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, {{but at the end of}} 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E
25|$|According to Friendly, Murrow asked Paley <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> destroy See It Now, {{into which}} the CBS chief {{executive}} had invested so much. Paley replied {{that he did not}} want a constant stomach ache every time Murrow covered a controversial subject.|$|E
60|$|I think, now, how odd it was, but how wonderfully like Mr. Micawber, that, when he {{went from}} London to Canterbury, he should have talked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to the {{farthest}} limits of the earth; and, {{when he went}} from England to Australia, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for a little trip across the channel.|$|R

25|$|Rum {{started to}} play an {{important}} role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican. In the 1833 Mississippi state senate election, one candidate, Judge Edward Turner, poured his drinks and socialized with the people. He was more personal and it appeared as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win. The other candidate, a Methodist parson named Dick Stewart, announced he would not be pouring their drinks and they could have as much as they wanted; Dick Stewart won.|$|E
25|$|Following {{complaints}} about roof damage in early 1999, the city inspected {{the building and}} found that while the building itself was structurally sound, several areas of the brick facade were loose and posed a danger to pedestrians. City inspectors also found a number of health, fire, and building codes and filed for an injunction to close the entire structure. An agreement was reached in October 1999 to make repairs, though only a few minor repairs were carried out on the brick facade, roof, and windows to prevent more pigeons from entering the upper floors. In March 2000, the remaining businesses in the building closed and the city set an April 1 deadline for Bujack to decide <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> renovate or raze the building. Although Bujack eventually decided to demolish the building, no work was ever started.|$|E
25|$|Upon being {{informed}} of the indictment, he urged his followers not to take any action <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sentenced to {{less than six months}} in prison, stressing that he wanted to give an example of dignity, but ordered a group of Legionaries to defend him in case of an attack by the authorities. He was arrested together with 44 other prominent members of the movement, including Ion Zelea Codreanu, Gheorghe Clime, Alexandru Cristian Tell, Radu Gyr, Nae Ionescu, Şerban Milcoveanu and Mihail Polihroniade, on the evening of April 16. The crackdown coincided with the Orthodox celebration of Palm Sunday (when all those targeted were known to be in their homes). After a short stay in the Romanian Police Prefecture, Codreanu was dispatched to Jilava prison, while the other prisoners were sent to Tismana Monastery (and later to concentration camps such as the one in Miercurea Ciuc).|$|E

I wonder <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to the dear Old Briar-patch to look for Peter Rabbit, or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to the Old Pasture in search of Reddy Fox, or if it is Mr. and Mrs. Grouse he hopes to kill.

25|$|Blackford was {{enrolled}} in Princeton University at age sixteen and graduated {{at the top of}} his class in 1806. On his enrollment forms he entered his middle name as Newton, but never again used the name during his life. Among his fifty-four classmates were John Williams Walker, James Iradell, John James Marshall, and Patrick Noble. Blackford became fluent in Greek and Latin and excelled in history. He also spent a considerable amount of time reading legal books on English common law. After college he studied law for a year in the office of Revolutionary War hero Colonel George MacDonald before moving on in 1810 to complete his legal studies in the office of New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Ford in Morristown. He was admitted to the bar in New Jersey that same year. He took only one case of his own and realized he needed to join a law firm <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to earn a living at his profession. He returned to his hometown and joined MacDonald's firm.|$|E
25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E
500|$|James Orsborne, giving evidence, {{said that}} he had learned from his brother about Moore's {{proposal}} {{to get rid of the}} boat, and had told George that he would be [...] "a darned fool" [...] even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because [...] "I thought that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him". Recalled to the witness box, Moore {{said that he}} had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.|$|E

500|$|During the game, Bob Sudyk, a {{reporter}} for the Cleveland Press, interviewed Adams and asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drum again at the following game. Adams said no, but Sudyk wrote in his article that he would. According to Adams, [...] "not to make a liar out of Bob, I showed up with my drum, and then I came to the next game and the next game and the next game." [...] The Indians' promotions director at the time, Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{evidence}} {{over three}} days, Harwood said that Tomlinson [...] "just looked as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay {{where he was}} forever and was almost inviting physical confrontation {{in terms of being}} moved on." [...] He said he had not warned Tomlinson and had acted because Tomlinson was encroaching a police line, which amounted to a breach of the peace. The court heard that Tomlinson's last words after collapsing were, [...] "they got me, the fuckers got me"; he died moments later. On 3 May 2011 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, ruling that the officer—Harwood was not named for legal reasons—had used excessive and unreasonable force in hitting Tomlinson, and had acted [...] "illegally, recklessly and dangerously." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{four and}} a half out of five stars, labelling it as [...] "non-stop intrigue and controlled suspense all the way". He particularly praised Smith's energetic performance, saying [...] "he pings and fizzes around the screen like a Technicolor firework, lighting up every scene he adorns". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded, [...] "Sweet, touching, intelligent, different, utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike— this is not only Doctor Who, but sci-fi telly at its finest". He also praised Gaiman's script for being [...] "a simple idea executed brilliantly". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times admitted he was unsure <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> like it with the [...] "grungy setting, wacko characters and peculiar dialogue", but ended up [...] "captivated". He particularly enjoyed seeing more of the TARDIS' interior and called it an [...] "instant oddball classic".|$|E

500|$|Union {{inaction}} {{created the}} opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived. On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, struck first [...] "like an Alpine avalanche" [...] near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River. Johnston was wounded and died during the engagement and command fell upon Beauregard. One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the [...] "Hornet's Nest", giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing. The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet's Nest to capture a Union division, but [...] "Grant's Last Line" [...] held Pittsburg Landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance. That evening, heavy rain set in while Grant and his staff took cover and huddled around a fire. When asked by McPherson <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> retreat, Grant replied, [...] "Retreat? No. I propose to attack them at daylight and whip them." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that {{was the most important thing}} was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E

His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see.

2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E

Māhū people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a {{respected}} group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers. Another Hawaiian word, aikāne, referred to same-sex relationships. According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many alii engaged in aikāne relationships. Hawaiian scholar Lilikalā Kameeleihiwa said, [...] "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle?
