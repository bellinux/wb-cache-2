40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{studied a}} {{possible}} mechanism of a failure from a thick <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> of a filament-wound rocket motor case with long cylindrical portion analytically and numerically. The hoop-wound fibers at the cylindrical portion was slightly inclined from the circumferential direction as a finite width prepreg tape was wound without overlapping or gap by alternately feeding in {{forward and backward}} direction. Fiber stress concentration in the <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> due to possible damage states was assessed through analytical studies and a rough estimate of the stress concentration was given by explicit functions. The possible damage consisted of transverse cracks slightly inclined {{from each other and}} debonding of the interface between the <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> and the base layer. The approximate analytical solution agreed well with the numerical results in spite of simplification. The results could show the possibility of stress enhancement due to damage in the thick <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> made of two slight inclined fibers and important guideline for the design of filament winding pressure vessels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental and numerical program to investigate the circular hollow section (CHS) beams, strengthened using Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheets. The circular hollow shaped steel beams bonded with different CFRP layer orientations were tested under four-point bending. The mid-span deflection, service load and failure load were recorded. The LHL (where L, first inner longitudinal layer, H, second <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> and L, third outer longitudinal layer) and LLH (where L, first inner longitudinal layer, L, second longitudinal layer and H, third outer <b>hoop</b> <b>layer)</b> layer oriented strengthened beams perform slightly better than HHL (where H, first inner <b>hoop</b> <b>layer,</b> H, second <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> and L, third outer longitudinal layer) layer oriented strengthened beams. The LHL and LLH layer oriented treated beams showed very similar structural behaviour. Numerical analyses were then conducted on the CFRP strengthened steel CHS beams. The validity of the models has been assessed by comparing the failure loads and mid-span deflections. The effects of various parameters such as bond length, section types, tensile modulus of CFRP, adhesive layer thickness and adhesive types have been studied...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{testing of}} {{laminated}} structures {{has indicated that}} the compressive strength is often considerably lower than that predicted by analytical methods. Poor testing techniques and poorly constructed materials seem to be possible reasons for the premature failure. However, {{since many of the}} failures are characterized by delamination of the structures, the cause of the failure may be due to local buckling of the composite plies. In this dissertation, a ply buckling model is studied to assist in the understanding of the failure mechanisms. In order to find the failure envelope, inplane fracture and overall buckling are assumed as the failure modes of these structures. The classical theory of elasticity for thin shells, including transverse shear deformation, is used in the derivation. Then, the relations between the predicted failure stresses and laminate orientations can be obtained. A simple optimum design procedure for laminate orientation and hoop/helical ply thickness ratio is proposed by using the previous two failure theories. The optimal point may be defined as the highest intersection of the various failure criteria. Results are presented {{in the form of a}} parametric study for three stacking sequences. Finally, the comparison of the failure stresses between the laminates with and without an inside <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a rapidly}} growing demand for more {{environmentally}} sustainable materials in the construction industry. Natural flax fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) have potential applications as lightweight skins for utility poles, pedestrian bridge elements, and small wind turbine shafts but the structural behaviour of flax-FRP wrapped foam beams {{has yet to be}} investigated. Six beams with various internal foam density and fibre arrangements were constructed and tested. A control beam was made using one glass-FRP (one layer of longitudinal fibres, one transverse) while the remaining used flax-FRP. A fabrication technique for constructing the tubes was developed and presented here. An arrangement using 5 layers of longitudinal flax fibres and 3 hoop flax fibres gives similar strength to the glass-FRP control; 4 longitudinal and 3 hoop flax fibres is expected to give similar stiffness to the glass-FRP control. Flexural strength and stiffness was found to be proportional to the number of longitudinal layers. Increasing the amount of <b>hoop</b> <b>layers</b> shifted the failure mode from compression to tension controlled. Flax-FRP beams that failed in compression gave slightly more warning and higher deflections than those that failed in tension. The results show that flax-FRP skinned foam beams have potential applications in lightweight construction but further testing under environmental and cyclic loading is recommended before these tubes are used in practice...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) members, {{there will be more}} chances of vehicles/vessels or terrorist attacks on these structures in near future. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening can be an effective option to reduce impact damage or failure of CFST members. However, existing knowledge is very limited in understanding the behaviour of FRP strengthened CFST structures under lateral impact loading. This paper outlines drop hammer impact test results of a series of experimental programs of bare and FRP strengthened CFST specimens. A total of sixteen CFST specimens were prepared and tested under lateral impact at their mid-span. The results indicate that permanent lateral displacement of CFST members can be reduced up to 18. 2 % by externally bonded FRP sheets. The effects of FRP type, FRP wrapping direction, carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrapping layers, wrapping length, and impact velocity were investigated to understand the influences of these parameters on the behaviour of strengthened CFST specimens. CFRP laminates were found to be weak under impact loading when wrapped in only longitudinal direction. However, a combination of longitudinal and <b>hoop</b> <b>layers</b> of CFRP laminates, or only GFRP wrapping, can remarkably minimise the severity of damage and failure of FRP in CFST specimens under lateral impact. A comparison of current test results with recent works has been presented to understand the effect of impact energy on the lateral displacement control ability of FRP strengthened CFST members...|$|R
40|$|The hollow {{structural}} members are highly vulnerable structural components subjected to transverse impact loads. These tubular {{members have been}} used widely in both onshore and offshore structures where lateral impact force can be expected from moving vehicles/vessels or terrorist attacks. Thus, strengthening of steel hollow tubular members is required to safely carry both service static and imposed dynamic impact loads. This paper presents the results {{from a series of}} tests on bare and fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthened circular hollow section (CHS) steel members subjected to transverse impact loading at mid span. A total of fourteen (two bare and twelve strengthened) medium scale specimens were tested to investigate the effect of FRP wrapping on the global and local deformation capacity of strengthened members under drop hammer impact. Both carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets were used as strengthening materials. The results indicate that the FRP strengthening of the tubes enhances their impact resistance capacity by reducing lateral displacements up to 29 % compared to bare steel CHS specimen. The influence of FRP type, CFRP orientation, CFRP thickness and effective bond length on the structural response and failure behaviour of wrapped members were investigated. The results showed that the application of FRP in the longitudinal direction was effective to control the global deformations whereas the <b>hoop</b> <b>layers</b> were effective in reducing local inward deformations of CHS members...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers are {{advanced materials}} with unique material properties {{that are being}} used in an increasingly number of industrial applications. In well intervention the high stiffness to weight ratio {{as well as the}} chemical resistance is being utilized to make a semi-stiff rod for logging purposes. The carbon rod has several advantages over its competitors, but the performance can be further improved for use in the horizontal sections of the well. As a solid carbon rod, the submerged weight causes the rod to press against the bottom of the casing generating friction which prevents the desired reach. By making the rod hollow, the submerged weight will reduce significantly and the rod will stay buoyant in the casing, hence extending the reach. The main focus {{of this study was to}} find and develop manufacturing methods for a continuous rod consisting of an inner layer of pure hoop and an outer layer of longitudinal fibers. One of the suggested methods included a filament wound <b>hoop</b> <b>layer</b> using a PPS thermoplastic impregnated carbon fiber tape with lay-up configuration corresponding to the previous tested rods based on epoxy resin. The PPS-rod was then tested with external overpressure and axial compression, the same tests performed on the epoxy-rod. The rods are considered as thick-walled tubes and had an outer diameter equal to 15 mm, which is the same as the current solid rod in field operation, and inner diameters at 12 mm. They were made using the filament winding machine at NTNU. The epoxy-rod was made with resin bath to ensure a good and even impregnation of the fibers, while a gas torch was used to melt the PPS-tape. Two rods were produced using a custom setup in the filament winding machine. Due to the provisional setup it is obvious the process and quality need more development. The rods were leaking under low pressure, and when sealed, the failure load was inconsistent and about 35 % of the failure load of the rod with made with epoxy. Microscopy shows many voids and cracks so the poor results are easily explained. Although the results could not be used to determine the potential of a rod based on a PPS matrix, the manufacturing method was proved to be a feasible way to produce a rod with the desired layup. The rod extracted easily from the mandrel and a continuous process seems feasible. Tensile tests on laminates of the PPS impregnated tape showed satisfying material properties. A study of different layups for the rod has also been conducted. Rods with layups [&# 177; 45 &# 176;] and [&# 177; 80 &# 176;/&# 177; 9 &# 176;] has been wound and tested with external overpressure and axial compression. Compared with the previously tested [&# 177; 80 &# 176;]-rod they showed marginally less pressure capacity, but at the compression test the [&# 177; 80 &# 176;/&# 177; 9 &# 176;] layup proved to be the best configuration due to its longitudinal fibers. Future work based on this study should focus on improving the manufacturing method of the PPS-rod. An adhesion test should also be conducted to determine how the PPS hoop rod bonds with a pultrusion resin. Temperature resistance is also an issue not discussed in this study and needs to be investigated as well as long term testing and the effect of creep. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{strengthening}} hollow core reinforced concrete (RC) columns and beams using external wrapping of Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The effects of fiber orientation of CFRP sheets on the axial load {{capacity of the}} columns and the shear capacity of the beams are the main parameters investigated from this study. Hollow members {{have been widely used}} in structures due to their evident advantages when compared to the solid members, such as significantly reducing the dead load of the superstructures, leading to the decrease of foundation dimensions while maintaining the strength and stiffness of the structure. As a result, the cost of construction is reduced. However, strengthening hollow columns and beams with FRP has not been well investigated. Therefore, studying the use of FRP for strengthening hollow core columns and beams is necessary. Sixteen specimens were designed and tested under different loading conditions in this study. These specimens were divided into two series. The first series consisting of twelve specimens and were tested as columns under concentric axial load, 25 mm and 50 mm eccentricity to investigate the effect of fiber orientation on the performance of the hollow core FRP-confined columns. The second series which included four specimens were tested as beams under four-point loading to study the improvement in shear capacity. All the specimens had square cross-section with 200 mm side dimension, 800 mm height and an 80 x 80 hole at their centers. The specimens were wrapped with CFRP sheets in different combinations of fiber orientations of 0 °, 45 °, and 90 °. For column specimens, test results showed that all wrapping configurations increased both the strength and ductility of hollow core square RC columns. The increase in ductility was significant for all specimens, especially for the specimens exclusively wrapped with <b>hoop</b> CFRP <b>layers.</b> Meanwhile, the increase in the compressive strength was marginal for all specimens (9 % to 25 % increases as compared with the control column). The fiber orientation influencing the gain in strength and ductility of the columns varies between different loading conditions. When the eccentricity was small, the use of CFRP <b>layers</b> in the <b>hoop</b> direction was shown to be the most effective wrapping method to enhance both the strength and ductility of the columns. For columns loaded under a large eccentricity, the combinations of the <b>hoop</b> <b>layers</b> with the vertical or diagonal layers outperformed the combination of the <b>hoop</b> CFRP <b>layers</b> only in terms of strength enhancement. In contrast, the ductility of the columns with CFRP in the hoop direction was greater than that of the columns wrapped with the other combinations. These wrapping configurations were shown to be much more efficient for the case of shear strengthening than for axial load strengthening. All wrapping configurations substantially increased the shear strength of the hollow RC beams (97 % to 219 % increases as compared with the control beam). The change in the fiber direction strongly affected the gain in the shear capacity and failure modes of the beam specimens. The combination of vertical CFRP layers to the longitudinal axis of the beam changed the failure mode of the beam to flexural failure, which was more ductile than shear failure. The combination of two diagonal and one vertical CFRP sheets to the longitudinal axis of the beam considerably increase the shear strength and deflection capacity of the beam...|$|R

40|$|External bonding {{of carbon}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) sheets with epoxy resin has been effectively used to strengthen and repair concrete structures. In recent years, {{there has been}} resurgence {{in the use of}} CFRP to strengthen steel bridges and structures as a result of increased service loads, corrosion and inadequate maintenance. This strengthening system may be extended to steel tubular structures, which may be prone to local buckling. Only a few studies tested steel tubular sections of wider section slenderness range, such as compact, non-compact and slender sections in bending, and addressed the behaviour of such sections reinforced using bidirectional (longitudinal and hoop directions) CFRP wraps. In addition, few studies have investigated the response of fully effective and not-fully effective composite steel hollow sections in compression. The research aims to understand the structural behaviour of steel circular hollow section (CHS) beams and short columns externally reinforced with CFRP sheets by means of static tests and theoretical analysis, and to develop rules for strength design of the composite sections. The effects of much wider section slenderness ratios, amount of CFRP and fibre orientation were examined. Initially, the flexural behaviour was investigated by conducting experiments on eighteen CHS beams (five control specimens and thirteen reinforced with CFRP sheets) under pure bending. The diameter-to-thickness ratios of the tubes used in the tests ranged from 12 to 96. Rotation and strain measurements at mid-length were taken. The reinforced beams had better performance compared with their bare steel counterparts, especially for tubes with larger diameter-to-thickness ratios. The experimental results have demonstrated that it improved the bending strength and rotation capacity of the bcams. The improvement in the behaviour of the CFRP-reinforced tubes appears {{to be related to the}} delay or elimination of elastic local buckling in slender section tubes as a result of the restraint provided by the <b>hoop</b> CFRP <b>layers.</b> The longitudinal fibre layers were shown to be effective in providing strength in the CHS beams. The increase in bending capacity obtained in the tests was between 3 and 90 %. The main failure mode of the strengthened beams is associated with crushing of the CFRP sheets. The second test programme was performed on short CHS columns subjected to axial compression. A total of ten columns were tested, of which six were reinforced with CFRP sheets and four were control specimens. The tubes have diameter-to-thickness ratios of ranging between 37 and 78. The parameters investigated included the amount of CFRP, the diameter-to-thickness ratio of the steel tube and the fibre configuration. The axial load-shortening and strains at mid-length of the tube were recorded throughout the period of loading. A theoretical model was developed to calculate the ultimate moment capacity of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS beams subjected to bending. The ultimate capacity was calculated based on equilibrium of forces and strain compatibility between CFRP and steel. The model assumed that the steel is either elastic, elastic-plastic or plastic at ultimate. Two cases were included in the analysis, one of which considers the CFRP in compression and the other does not account for the CFRP in compression. It was found that the CFRP in compression has significant influence on the ultimate capacity of CHS beams. Further analysis was carried out to predict the moment-curvature response of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS beams. Material nonlinearity was implemented using a tri-linear stress-strain relationship for the steel and a linear elastic relationship for the CFRP material, involving subdivision of the section into elemental areas. The inclusion of volume fractions of the fibre and adhesive is necessary to determine the elastic properties of the CFRP. The nonlinear equilibrium equations were solved using an incremental-iterative method. The analytical predictions were verified with the experimental results. It was shown that the volume fraction of the fibre has an effect on the initial stiffness of CHS beams. The effects of local imperfections in slender section tubes and strain hardening in the post-yield stage would need to be taken into account in the analysis to improve the accuracy of the results. A design method based on the modular ratio concept was proposed for the CFRP¬-reinforced steel circular tubular beams and short columns. The applicability of current section slenderness limits for steel hollow sections for the design of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS has been discussed. Design expressions for CFRP-reinforced CHS were derived as a function of the parameters related to the amount of CFRP, the elastic modulus of hoop CFRP, the geometrical slenderness, and the yield stress of steel. Design curves illustrating the significance of strengthening parameters were developed, and they form the basis of a simple and effective design procedure for CFRP-reinforced steel CHS tubular beams and columns...|$|R
