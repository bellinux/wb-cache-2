Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time, and harm to health from their use is of concern. The carbamate insecticide propoxur is highly toxic to bed bugs, but it has potential toxicity to children exposed to it, and the US Environmental Protection Agency {{has been reluctant to}} approve it for indoor use. Boric acid, occasionally applied as a safe indoor insecticide, is not effective against bed bugs because they do not groom. The fungus Beauveria bassiana is being researched [...] for its ability to control bed bugs. As bed bugs continue to adapt pesticide resistance, researchers have examined the insect's genome to see how its adaptations develop and to look for potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited in its growth and development phases.|$|E

50|$|A {{survey of}} the primary dairy {{producing}} areas in the US indicated that 13 percent of lactating animals were treated with insecticides permethrin, pyrethrin, coumaphos, and <b>dichlorvos</b> primarily by daily or every-other-day coat sprays.

50|$|Since {{it is an}} {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor, {{symptoms of}} <b>dichlorvos</b> exposure include weakness, headache, tightness in chest, blurred vision, salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, eye and skin irritation, miosis (pupil constriction), eye pain, runny nose, wheezing, laryngospasm, cyanosis, anorexia, muscle fasciculation, paralysis, dizziness, ataxia, convulsions, hypotension (low blood pressure), and cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichlorvos</b> or 2,2-dichlorovinyl {{dimethyl}} phosphate (commonly abbreviated as DDVP) is a organophosphate, {{widely used}} as an insecticide to control household pests, in public health, and protecting stored product from insects.

50|$|When Japanese {{police and}} other prefectural {{authorities}} inspected the recalled dumplings, they found pesticides other than methamidophos, including <b>dichlorvos</b> and parathion.

50|$|Exposure {{to any one}} of the above-listed {{organophosphates}} {{occurs on}} a daily basis through inhalation, absorption, and ingestion, most commonly of food that has been treated with an organophosphate herbicide or insecticide. Exposure to these chemicals can occur at public buildings, schools, residential areas, and in agricultural areas.

50|$|In {{managing}} M. rotundata for pollination, such methods as <b>dichlorvos</b> pest {{strips and}} ultraviolet lamps placed above liquid traps {{are effective in}} killing parasitoids but not harming M. rotundata. Other methods of preventing parasitoid invasion include physical barriers.

Another way that pest are controlled is by opening up the nesting material and cleaning the cocoons.|$|E

50|$|The {{intermediate}} syndrome (IMS) {{appears in}} the interval {{between the end of}} the cholinergic crisis and the onset of OPIDP. Symptoms associated with IMS manifest within 24-96 hours after exposure. The exact etiology, incidence, and risk factors associated with IMS are not clearly understood, but IMS is recognized as a disorder of neuromuscular junctions. IMS occurs when a person has a prolonged and severe inhibition of AChE and has been linked to specific OP pesticides such as methylparathion, <b>dichlorvos,</b> and parathion. Patients present with increasing weakness of facial, neck flexor and respiratory muscles.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance to {{avermectins}} {{has been}} reported, which suggests moderation in use. Research on ivermectin, piperazine, and <b>dichlorvos</b> in combinations also shows potential for toxicity.

[...] Adverse effects are usually transient; severe effects are rare and probably occur only with substantial overdose, but include coma, hypotension, and respiratory failure, which can lead to death. No specific therapy exists, but symptomatic management usually leads to a favorable prognosis.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012 {{consumer}} action groups demanded four unlisted toxic pesticides {{found on}} common vegetables at levels 100 times the EU guidelines (which are banned in developed countries) be banned. Chemical companies are requesting to {{add them to}} the Thai Dangerous Substances Act so {{they can continue to}} be used, including on exported mangoes to developed countries which have banned their use. In 2014, Khon Kaen University concluded after a study, that Thailand should ban 155 types of pesticides, with 14 listed as urgent: Carbofuran, Methyl Bromide, <b>Dichlorvos,</b> Lambda-cyhalothrin, Methidathion-methyl, Omethoate, Zeta Cypermethrin, Endosulfan sulfate, Aldicarb, Azinphos-methyl, Chlorpyrifos-ethyl, Methoxychlor and Paraquat.|$|E
50|$|Some insecticides, {{including}} carbamates and organophosphates such as <b>dichlorvos,</b> malathion and parathion, are nerve agents. The metabolism {{of insects}} is sufficiently different from mammals that these compounds have {{little effect on}} humans and other mammals at proper doses; but there is considerable concern {{about the effects of}} long-term exposure to these chemicals by farm workers and animals alike. At high enough doses, acute toxicity and death can occur through the same mechanism as other nerve agents. Organophosphate pesticide poisoning is a major cause of disability in many developing countries and is often the preferred method of suicide.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{treatments}} for infection with Toxocara cati include drugs designed {{to cause the}} adult worms to become partially anaesthetized and detach from the intestinal lining, allowing them to be excreted live in the feces. Such medications include piperazine and pyrantel. These are frequently combined with the drug praziquantel which appears to cause the worm to lose its resistance to being digested by the host animal. Other effective treatments include ivermectin, milbemycin, and selamectin. [...] <b>Dichlorvos</b> has also been proven to be effective as a poison, though moves to ban it over concerns about its toxicity have made it unavailable in some areas.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency have {{reviewed}} the safety data of <b>dichlorvos</b> several times. In 1995 a voluntary {{agreement was reached}} with the supplier, Amvac Chemical Corporation which restricted the use of dichlovos in many, but not all, domestic uses, all aerial applications, and other uses. Additional voluntary cancellations were implemented in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Major concerns focus on acute and chronic toxicity {{and the fact that}} this pesticide is prevalent in urban waterways. [...] A 2010 study found that each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of ADHD in children.|$|E
5000|$|The {{well-established}} {{resistance of}} bed bugs to DDT and pyrethroids {{has created a}} need for different and newer chemical approaches to the extermination of bed bugs. In 2008 a study was conducted on bed bug resistance {{to a variety of}} both old and new insecticides, with the following results, listed in order from most- to least-effective: λ-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, carbaryl, imidacloprid, fipronil, permethrin, diazinon, spinosyn, <b>dichlorvos,</b> chlorfenapyr, and DDT. [...] Note that the first of these, λ-cyhalothrin, is itself a pyrethroid-based insecticide— in the past it has been used principally for the treatment of cotton crops and so bed bugs have not developed a genetic resistance to it.|$|E
