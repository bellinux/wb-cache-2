5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 <b>interview.</b> <b>This</b> friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was attracted to him. One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an <b>interview.</b> <b>This</b> sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another <b>interview,</b> <b>this</b> time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger.
