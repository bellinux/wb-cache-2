5000|$|A <b>flysheet</b> or rain fly (found only {{in double}} skin tents) {{is used to}} protect the actual tent from water. A <b>flysheet</b> is {{waterproof}} {{on the outside and}} also provides a surface to collect condensation on the inside, which then runs down to the ground. When a <b>flysheet</b> is used, it is important that there be no contact with the inner tent it is protecting; this keeps the inner dry. 'Expedition' tents often have extra poles to help ensure that wind does not blow the two layers into contact.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways {{to put up a}} bivouac shelter. The most common method is to use one bivouac sheet as the roof of the shelter and a second as the groundsheet. The 'roof' <b>flysheet</b> is suspended along in its ridge line by a cord tied between two trees which are a suitable distance apart. The four corners of the <b>flysheet</b> are then either pegged out or tied down to other trees. Care must be taken to leave a gap between the ground and the sheet to ensure that there is enough air flow to stop condensation.|$|E
50|$|Single {{skin with}} flysheet: A {{waterproof}} <b>flysheet</b> or rain fly is suspended over and {{clear of the}} roof of the tent; it often overlaps the tent roof slightly, but does not extend down the sides or ends of the tent.|$|E
50|$|During {{the long}} {{argument}} about admitting women as students at Cambridge, there were votes by the Senate in 1897 {{and again in}} 1920, following intense public debates among lecturers and undergraduates, and the circulation of many <b>flysheets</b> propounding arguments for and against. Sorley was persistently hostile to any presence of women in Cambridge and argued {{that they were not}} after equality but sought power and would damage university life. He authored several <b>flysheets</b> with Prof. Ridgeway - both wanted women totally excluded from Cambridge and instead a separate women's university set up for them.|$|R
5000|$|Johann Eberlin von Günzburg (c. 1470 in Kleinkötz near Günzburg in Bavaria [...] - [...] 1533 in Leutershausen) was a German theologian {{who became}} {{prominent}} {{as the author}} of reformist <b>flysheets</b> and pamphlets.|$|R
5000|$|Flade was not {{supportive}} of this undemocratic election process. Using a toy printing set the 18-year-old produced 186 <b>flysheets</b> protesting against the election. [...] One version denounced the [...] "election fraud" [...] while another, titled [...] "The Goose", was a satirical composition concerning the massive reparations {{having to be}} delivered to the Soviet Union and the dire condition of the German Democratic Republic: [...] "The goose waddles like President Pieck, croaks like Minister Grotewohl and is plucked like the German people" [...] Between 10 and 14 October 1950, Hermann Fade pasted his <b>flysheets</b> on houses, walls and lampposts. During the evening of 14 October he was surprised by a plain clothes policeman. [...] Flade fled after resisting arrest using a pocket knife with which he cut the upper arm {{and the back of}} the plainclothes man, who was thereby lightly injured. [...] Following an extensive search, on 16 October 1950, Fade was arrested and taken into investigative custody.|$|R
50|$|The basic dome {{design has}} been {{modified}} extensively, producing tents with three poles, tents with irregularly-shaped bases, and other unusual types. A common variation {{is to add}} a third pole between two adjacent corners; this is angled away from the tent and supports {{an extension of the}} <b>flysheet,</b> to give a porch/storage area.|$|E
5000|$|A gazebo uses a {{framework}} of metal poles to support a roof. This structure provides a lot more usable space than does a <b>flysheet,</b> since the gently sloping roof allows for {{a reasonable amount of}} headroom even at the edges (like a frame tent). Because a gazebo is free-standing, it is often used as a shelter for a temporary shop at a fair or street market.|$|E
5000|$|A fly (or <b>flysheet)</b> {{consists}} of a single rectangular sheet of material. Two opposite sides are held {{up in the middle}} by poles, or sometimes just a rope between conveniently placed trees. The tops of the poles are attached via guy ropes to pegs, {{in order to keep the}} poles upright. Additional guy ropes are attached to the lower edges to pull them outwards away from the poles.|$|E
5000|$|The British dropped {{millions}} of <b>flysheets</b> over Germany to allay {{fears of a}} punitive peace that would destroy the German state. The text cited the Charter as the authoritative statement of the joint commitment of Great Britain and the U.S. [...] "not to admit any economical discrimination of those defeated" [...] and promised that [...] "Germany and the other states can again achieve enduring peace and prosperity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lancaster's pattern {{centerfire}} and pinfire [...]410 shot cartridges {{first appeared}} in Eley Brothers Ltd. <b>flysheets</b> in 1857. By 1874, Eleys were advertising modern centerfire [...]410 cartridges. It appears to have become popular around 1900, although it was recommended as [...] "suited {{to the requirements of}} naturalists, and for such weapons as walking-stick guns", presumably for self-defense, in 1892 by W. W. Greener. [...] The first ammunition was 2.0 inches (50.8 mm) long, compared with the modern 2.5 and 3.0 in sizes.|$|R
50|$|From 15 March 2015, new {{regulations}} banned shops from opening on Sundays. The new regulation only allowed trading by shops with an area no greater than 200 m2, {{and even then}} {{only if they are}} operated by the owner or a close family member related by blood or marriage. The general exception from the law is the four Sundays in Advent and one day that the shops can choose themselves. Lidl chooses to open and close different stores on different Sundays, and lists which will be open in its <b>flysheets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dome tents have a {{very simple}} {{structure}} and are available {{in a wide variety}} of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person tents with limited headroom up to 6 or 9-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm. These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial <b>flysheet,</b> or double wall. Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outer-tent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the inner tent dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.|$|E
50|$|Hilleberg {{manufactures}} tents {{of various}} designs and sizes, but their production {{is focused on}} specialist lightweight tents at the premium end of the market. Hilleberg's tent line is dominated by twin-skin designs that erect <b>flysheet</b> and inner-tent simultaneously, a feature that was introduced in their first model, the Keb. Their products {{have a reputation for}} excellent quality, durability and design, albeit matched with high prices. Their most well-known tents are the Keron, the Nallo ultra-light tent, the Nammatj versatile expedition tunnel tent (pictured), the freestanding Staika dome tent and the Akto single hoop tunnel for solo campers.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{businesses}} such as Black's and Benjamin Edgington's manufactured and retailed tents to Whymper's general design, {{calling them}} [...] "Whymper" [...] tents and these became the dominant design. Edgington's first sold them in 1892 and were still advertising them in 1960. Arguably, for mountain use the design was not improved on until geodesic dome tents {{appeared in the}} late 1970s although changes were made such as improved fabrics and replacing wooden poles with aluminium. The A-frame (A-pole) construction was resistant to wind and was very stable. A <b>flysheet</b> was sometimes recommended and the poles could be made of bamboo. However, the original size was sometimes found too small for four people and a 7 ft square version weighing 26 lb was available.|$|E
40|$|Early modern governments {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of printed texts as part of their public health strategies, including broadsheets, <b>flysheets</b> and pamphlets. This study focuses on health passes, a form of ephemeral print which asserted that the bearer had travelled from a city which was free from plague. Passes were printed forms with textual, iconographic and material features which sought to enhance their authority, credibility and usability. Completed forms provide evidence of their users and of how passes were adapted in response to particular perceived threats. This study examines passes issued by a large number of European cities to argue {{for the development of a}} shared European culture of public health print, inspired by recognition of print’s persuasiveness, efficiency and capacity to transcend the boundaries of place...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} November 1755, news of the Lisbon {{earthquake}} spread {{rapidly to}} all capital cities of Europe. Horrific reports {{gave rise to a}} wealth of sensational journalism. As Samuel Johnson and others attest, this was particularly marked in Great Britain. The catastrophe remained a popular subject of <b>flysheets,</b> newspapers, and engravings for months on end. The event was magnified many times over in the eyes and minds by the popular press, which led to forms of public distress. For {{the first time in the}} western world, the press, on the occasion of the Lisbon earthquake, helped create the illusion of proximity and unity between the peoples of different nations in Europe. As Voltaire said, L Europe ressemblait une grande famille r unie apr s ses diff rences. ...|$|R
40|$|The author gives {{examples}} of research recently published in professional journals that directly helped, or could help, in formulating policy advice (and perhaps even policymaking). An article by Younger (1992) was helpful in analyzing {{a problem in}} Ghana, where aid flows to government crowded out the private sector (especially private investment), which competed for scarce domestic resources. Younger suggested that tighter fiscal policy combined with looser monetary policy would promote more investment. Younger's analysis helped frame thinking {{in an area where}} muddleheadedness is common, and provided the author with analytical ammunition when he supported budgetary restraint. In another example, research based on the Ghana Living Standards Survey helped identify the poverty consequences of alternative revenue instruments. The link between economic policy and research can be made, says the author, {{but that does not mean}} it will be made. Usually such a link relies on the change placing of a researcher in the policymaking and advising trenches. One problem is that policymakers face highly specific, timebound problems and are interested only in answers to particular questions. But what matters to researchers is the generality of results or the methodological innovations in analysis. Journals turn down papers that answer very specific policy questions. The appropriate dissemination of research results requires that researchers speak the language of policymakers. The author proposes the following. Professional researchers should do highly country-specific and policy-specific studies that use the best-practice methodological tools plus a detailed institutional knowledge of the country. There should be a continuous attempt at synthesizing the findings of professional research for the benefit of the policy community, as is done in the World Bank Research Observer. "We need single-page or double-page <b>flysheets</b> summarizing research results,"says the author, particularly those that are country-specific and policy-specific. Research should be presented in short, pithy summaries that policymakers and their top advisors can understand, setting out the policy question addressed and the answer provided (the latter are not so common, especially for Africa). "A basic rule of thumb I have developed is that anything longer than two pages is unlikely to be read by the most senior policymakers, the limit for the next most senior is four pages, then eight pages, and 16 pages. If it is longer than 16 pages, do not bother to send it to the policy fraternity (unless it is prefaced by a two-page summary).

50|$|The 1921 British Mount Everest {{reconnaissance}} expedition used Mummery {{tents and}} 35 lb Whymper tents (as well as 40 lb and 80 lb military tents) {{but for the}} 1922 Everest expedition a modification was tried using a smaller 19 lb version with a <b>flysheet,</b> which was called a Meade tent, after the British climber, Charles Meade. In a few cases a circular entrance was adopted for each kind of tent {{but this was not}} popular with the climbers. The expedition also used Whymper tents in preference to the heavier ones of 1921.It was from a small, two-man, 10 lb Meade tent at Camp VI that George Mallory and Sandy Irvine left on their final attempt on the summit of Everest on the 1924 expedition.The 1933 Everest expedition used Meade tents 6.5 by 4 ft that weighed 16 lb as well as 7 ft square Whymper tents. The successful 1953 expedition used two-man Meade tents for the higher camps and Hunt reported that one night at a low level eight Sherpas slept in a two-man tent.|$|E
40|$|Identical {{experiments}} on snow-atmosphere interaction {{were carried out}} at two arctic sites (open forest and tundra, Inuvik, Canada) prior to spring snowmelt, April 1992. The purpose of the experiments was to estimate the magnitude and direction of net fluxes (dry depositionlre-emission) of NO, and SO, between the snow surface and the atmosphere from changes in the concentrations of these species in the surface snow over periods of 36 - 48 hours. The experiment was also designed to {{determine the influence of}} solar radiation on fluxes of NO, and SO,. The methodology included a procedure to homogenise surface snow; this served to normalise the initial chemical conditions for all sample sets used in the experiment. The homogeneous samples were exposed to the atmosphere in a series of mesh bags which allowed free exchange of water vapour, trace gases and aerosols between the atmosphere and the snow. The control study for the influence of solar radiation on the snow-atmosphere exchange was identical to that of the bagged snow under open sunny sky expept that. it was carried out in the shade of an opaque <b>flysheet.</b> The chemical composition and snow-water equivalent (SWE) of all bagged snows were determined before and after each experiment. The results from experiments at both sites show that solar radiation had no influence on snow-atmosphere exchange of NO, and SO,. In the first experiment at the forested site sublimation of water vapour from the snow occurred. The mass loss of water vapour was equally offset i...|$|E
