Henry, Professor of Classics at Iowa State University, maintains that [...] "biographical anecdotes that arose in antiquity about Aspasia are wildly colorful, almost completely unverifiable, and {{still alive and}} well in the twentieth century". She finally concludes that [...] "it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [...] life". According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J. Samons II, Professors of Classics and history, [...] "it may well be, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> know, that the real Aspasia was more than a match for her fictional counterpart".|$|E

When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E

2500|$|When Flagler envisioned {{successes in}} the oil industry, he and Rockefeller started {{building}} their fortune in refining oil in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland became very well known for oil refining, as, [...] "More and more crude oil was shipped from the oil regions to Cleveland for the refining process because of transportation facilities and the aggressiveness of the refiners there. It was due largely {{to the efforts of}} Henry M. Flagler and John D. Rockefeller." [...] Flagler and Rockefeller worked hard for their company to achieve such prominence. Henry explained: [...] "We worked night and day, making good oil as cheaply as possible and selling it <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> could get." [...] Not only did Flagler and Rockefeller's Standard Oil company become well known in Ohio, they expanded to other states, as well as gained additional capital in purchasing smaller oil refining companies across the nation. According to Allan Nevins, in John D. Rockefeller (p 292), [...] "Standard Oil was born as a big enterprise, it had cut its teeth as a partnership and was now ready to plunge forward into a period of greater expansion and development. It soon was doing one tenth of all the petroleum business in the United States. Besides its two refineries and a barrel plant in Cleveland, it possessed a fleet of tank cars and warehouses {{in the oil}} regions as well as warehouses and tanks in New York." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writers do not all {{follow the}} same terminology. The phrase [...] "statistical interpretation", {{referring}} to the [...] "ensemble interpretation", often indicates {{an interpretation of the}} Born rule somewhat different from the Copenhagen interpretation. For the Copenhagen interpretation, it is axiomatic that the wave function exhausts all that can ever be known in advance about a particular occurrence of the system. The [...] "statistical" [...] or [...] "ensemble" [...] interpretation, on the other hand, is explicitly agnostic about whether the information in the wave function is exhaustive of what might be known in advance. It sees itself as more 'minimal' than the Copenhagen interpretation in its claims. It only goes as far as saying that on every occasion of observation, some actual value of some property is found, and that such values are found probabilistically, as detected by many occasions of observation of the same system. The many occurrences of the system are said to constitute an 'ensemble', and they jointly reveal the probability through these occasions of observation. Though they all have the same wave function, the elements of the ensemble might not be identical to one another in all respects, according to the 'agnostic' interpretations. They may, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>we</b> know, beyond current knowledge and beyond the wave function, have individual distinguishing properties. For present-day science, the experimental significance of these various forms of Born's rule is the same, since they make the same predictions about the probability distribution of outcomes of observations, and the unobserved or unactualized potential properties are not accessible to experiment.|$|E
