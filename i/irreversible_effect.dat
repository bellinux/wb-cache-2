Some bacteria {{may be able to}} survive when administered antibiotics (especially at low concentrations). Those colonies will multiply and produce new colonies that are resistant to that particular antibiotic and will not succumb the next time antibiotics are administered. Because rivers and streams are ever flowing objects they are an ideal pathway for antibiotics to reach bacteria and therefore provide a source and reservoir for resistant strains to develop and establish themselves.|$|E

"The crisis {{brought about}} by the {{accelerated}} pace and the probably irreversible character of the effect of human activities on nature requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and social barriers, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be.

However, it discounting were abandoned, use of the standard cost - benefit-analysis framework would require the forecasting of shadow prices for all future dates, unless arbitrary time horizon is adopted. Thus cost - benefit analysis {{does not appear to}} be a satisfactory method for evaluating effects on future generations. ...|$|R

50|$|The period {{marked a}} steep {{change in the}} {{diversity}} and composition of Earth's biosphere. The Ediacaran biota suffered a mass extinction {{at the start of}} the Cambrian Period, which corresponded to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour. This behaviour had a profound and <b>irreversible</b> <b>effect</b> on the substrate which transformed the seabed ecosystems. Before the Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by microbial mats. By the end of the Cambrian, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats in many areas through bioturbation, and gradually turned the seabeds into what they are today. As a consequence, many of those organisms that were dependent on the mats became extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment that now offered new ecological niches.Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the mineralized phyla except the Bryozoa, which appeared in the Lower Ordovician. However, many of those phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla.While the early Cambrian showed such diversification that it has been named the Cambrian Explosion, this changed later in the period, when there occurred a sharp drop in biodiversity. About 515 million years ago, the number of species going extinct exceeded the number of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also, the speciation rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 million years ago, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to hypoxia, while the level of poisonous hydrogen sulfide simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and show evidence of several rapid extinction events; the stromatolites which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as Archaeocyatha, returned once more as the archaeocyathids became extinct. This declining trend did not change until the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.|$|E

We preincubated human serum albumin with isoflurane, dialyzed to release agent, and assessed protein conformation. Susceptibility to chemical modification by methylglyoxal and nitrophenylacetate was also examined. Isoflurane had a persistent effect on protein conformation. An increase in the susceptibility of surface residues to chemical modification attended this change in conformation. Modification of isoflurane-treated HSA included intra- and intersubunit cross-linking {{that may be a}} consequence of anesthetic-induced changes in multimeric subpopulations.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to group A streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae, cells of Streptococcus sanguis (group H) do not exhibit the <b>irreversible</b> <b>effects</b> of penicillin treatment, such as loss of viability or lysis. On the other hand, the same bacteria show typical effects of penicillin, such as morphological alterations, {{reduction in the}} rate of cell wall synthesis, and secretion of murein and lipoteichoic acid polymers into the medium. A novel effect of cell wall inhibitors was also noted: treatment with beta-lactams or with fosfomycin, d-cycloserine, or beta-halogeno-d-alanine caused the release of substantial amounts of glycerol lipids into the growth medium. The antibiotic “tolerance” of S. sanguis is interpreted in terms of the hypothesis that the activity of bacterial murein hydrolases is essential for the <b>irreversible</b> <b>effects</b> of cell wall inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|In acromegaly, {{overproduction}} of GH and IGF-I causes abnormal {{extracellular matrix}} regulation. We hypothesized {{that this may}} predispose {{to the development of}} colonic diverticula. Because the relation between acromegaly and colonic diverticula is unknown, the study aim was to assess the prevalence of colonic diverticula in patients with cured acromegaly. This was a case-control study. We screened reports of colonoscopies performed for the purpose of screening for polyps in 107 patients with cured or biochemically controlled acromegaly and in 214 age- and sex-matched controls for the presence of diverticula, dolichocolon, and polyps. In patients, the findings were related to GH/IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly and to the duration of GH/IGF-I excess. In acromegaly, colonic diverticula were present in 37 % of patients, dolichocolon in 34 %, and adenomatous polyps in 34 %, which was increased compared with controls (odds ratio 3. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4, 5. 7; 12. 4, 95 % confidence interval 6. 8, 18. 0; 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9, 6. 4, respectively). The presence of colonic diverticula was associated with both GH and IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly, when adjusted for the duration of active disease. The presence of dolichocolon and adenomatous polyps was associated with higher IGF-I concentrations at diagnosis. Acromegaly is associated with an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula.
