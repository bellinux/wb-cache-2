5|$|The Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau (1801–1883) formulated {{the mathematical}} {{problem of the}} existence of a minimal surface with a given boundary, which is now named after him. He studied soap films intensively, formulating Plateau's laws which describe the structures formed by films in <b>foams.</b>|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; <b>foams</b> of {{different}} materials occur in nature. <b>Foams</b> composed of soap films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the tetrahedral angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; his solution uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such <b>foams</b> present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>foam</b> that can form from this process. They are wet <b>foam</b> (or kugelschaum) and dry <b>foam</b> (or polyederschaum). Wet <b>foam</b> tends to form at the lower portion of the <b>foam</b> column, while dry <b>foam</b> tends to form at the upper portion. The wet <b>foam</b> is more spherical and viscous, and the dry <b>foam</b> tends to be larger in {{diameter}} and less viscous. Wet <b>foam</b> forms closer to the originating liquid, while dry <b>foam</b> develops at the outer boundaries. As such, what most people usually understand as <b>foam</b> is actually only dry <b>foam.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Foam</b> {{fraction}} can be {{retrieved from}} space-based microwave radiometric data at frequencies from 1 to 37 GHz. The retrievals require modeling of ocean surface emissivity fully covered with sea <b>foam.</b> To model <b>foam</b> emissivity well, knowledge of <b>foam</b> properties, both mechanical and dielectric, is necessary because these control the radiative processes in <b>foam.</b> We present a physical description of <b>foam</b> dielectric properties {{obtained from the}} <b>foam</b> dielectric constant including <b>foam</b> skin depth; <b>foam</b> impedance; wavelength variations in <b>foam</b> thickness, roughness of <b>foam</b> layer interfaces with air and seawater; and <b>foam</b> scattering parameters such as size parameter, and refraction index. Using these, we analyze the scattering, absorption, reflection and transmission in <b>foam</b> and gain insights into why volume scattering in <b>foam</b> is weak; why the main absorption losses are confined to the wet portion of the foam; how the <b>foam</b> impedance matching provides the transmission of electromagnetic radiation in <b>foam</b> and maximizes the absorption; {{and what is the}} potential for surface scattering at the <b>foam</b> layers boundaries. We put all these elements together and offer a conceptual understanding for the high, black-body-like emissivity of <b>foam</b> floating on the sea surface. We also consider possible scattering regimes in <b>foam...</b>|$|R

5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, <b>foams,</b> tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting <b>foams</b> used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E

In {{this paper}} PBS <b>foaming</b> materials is prepared by physical <b>foaming</b> method of one-step compression molding. The influences of blowing agent and nucleating agent, the <b>foaming</b> temperature and <b>foaming</b> time on the cellular morphology of PBS <b>foaming</b> materials have been studied. The results showed that when the <b>foaming</b> temperature was 160 ˚C, the blowing agent content was 5 parts, the <b>foaming</b> pressure was higher than 10 MPa, and the <b>foaming</b> time was 20 minutes with nucleating agent addition, the cellular morphology and mechanical properties of the <b>foaming</b> materials were better. The results showed that the <b>foaming</b> technology influenced greatly on the properties of <b>foam</b> of PBS materials. The expansion ratio had a small drop when the temperature increased. The addition of nucleator talc and <b>foaming</b> aids urea increased first then decreased the expansion ratio of the PBS <b>foaming</b> materials...|$|R

30|$|Foamability and <b>foam</b> {{stability}} are {{two important}} properties of <b>foam</b> that determine its propagation during foam-based EOR. Foamability {{is defined as}} the capability of the surfactants to form <b>foam,</b> and <b>foam</b> stability is described by the variations of <b>foam</b> height or volume with time, following <b>foam</b> generation (Belhaij and Al-Mahdy 2015). In <b>foam</b> stability test, surfactants were tested for their ability to form stable <b>foam</b> and to provide suitable concentration for preparation of formulation. In this work, the foamability and <b>foam</b> stability of different surfactants and their mixtures were studied to screen chemical formulations for core flood studies.|$|R
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, <b>foams,</b> and varnishes.|$|E

In this work, we investigate {{the potential of}} foam-based conformance for high-temperature and high-salinity carbonates. We evaluate different <b>foaming</b> agents. Stability tests and dynamic bulk <b>foam</b> experiments provided the means to identify suitable <b>foaming</b> agents. The selection was based on several key parameters including <b>foam</b> height, <b>foam</b> half-life, liquid drainage and <b>foam</b> decay time. The selected <b>foaming</b> agents were then used to perform different core flooding experiments to evaluate <b>foam</b> mobility reduction capacity and demonstrate the potential increase in oil recovery.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:The {{morphology}} and compressive {{properties of}} EPDM <b>foam</b> were investigated against <b>foaming</b> temperatures (i. e 140, 150 and 160 oC). The blowing agent {{used in this}} study was sodium bicarbonate. The rubber compositions were expanded and cured using conventional compression moulding technique via heat transfer <b>foaming</b> process. The morphology of EPDM <b>foam</b> was characterized with respect to the cell size, relative <b>foam</b> density and crosslink density. Meanwhile the compressive properties were characterized using compression load-deflection and compression set testing. Increase in <b>foaming</b> temperature resulted in larger cell size. The crosslink densities in EPDM <b>foam</b> were determined using Flory-Rhener equation and results indicated that the crosslink density has slightly decreased with increasing <b>foaming</b> temperature. The relative <b>foam</b> density also showed decreasing when the <b>foaming</b> temperature was increased. For mechanical properties, the highest <b>foam</b> density has resulted in the highest compressive stress. Compression stress at 50 % strain decreased with increasing <b>foaming</b> temperature. It was also found that the compression set decreased with increasing <b>foaming</b> temperature. The results showed that the morphology and compressive properties of the EPDM <b>foam</b> can be controlled closely by the <b>foaming</b> temperature...|$|R

25|$|Foam-compatible, {{which is}} a sodium {{bicarbonate}} (BC) based dry chemical, was developed for use with protein <b>foams</b> for fighting class B fires. Most dry chemicals contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the foam blanket created by protein (animal) based <b>foams.</b> Foam compatible type uses silicone as a waterproofing agent, which does not harm foam. Effectiveness is identical to regular dry chemical, and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are blue). This agent is generally no longer used since most modern dry chemicals are considered compatible with synthetic <b>foams</b> such as AFFF.|$|E

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the current {{knowledge}} regarding (i) the mechanisms governing foamability and <b>foam</b> stability, and (ii) models for the <b>foam</b> column kinetics. Although different length scales of <b>foam</b> structure, such as air–water interface and liquid film, have been studied to elucidate the mechanisms that control the foamability and <b>foam</b> stability, many questions remain unanswered. It {{is due to the}} collective effects of different mechanisms involved and the complicated structures of <b>foam</b> sub-structures such as <b>foam</b> films, Plateau borders and nodes, and <b>foam</b> networks like soft porous materials. The current knowledge of the effects of solid particles on liquid film stability and <b>foam</b> drainage is also discussed to highlight gaps in our present level of understanding <b>foam</b> systems with solid particles.

40|$|Although <b>foamed</b> bitumen {{has been}} widely applied in {{pavement}} construction some of its aspects are still not yet understood. In this study, some of these aspects including: effects of the <b>foaming</b> process on binder chemistry, characterization of <b>foamed</b> bitumen and development of a rational method to optimize <b>foam</b> characteristics, evaluation of aggregate particle coating within <b>foamed</b> bitumen treated materials, and development of a gyratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with <b>foamed</b> bitumen were addressed. The effects of the <b>foaming</b> process on bitumen chemistry were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Also, <b>foam</b> characteristics of three binders were established and a rational method to optimize <b>foam</b> characteristics proposed. Aggregate particle coating with <b>foamed</b> bitumen was studied using the concepts of surface energy and Rice density. In addition a gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with <b>foamed</b> bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Infrared techniques have shown that <b>foaming</b> does not cause any changes in the binder chemistry, suggesting that <b>foaming</b> may be a physical process. Further, <b>foam</b> characteristics are greatly influenced by binder viscosity. Also, the equiviscous temperature seems to produce <b>foam</b> with optimum <b>foam</b> characteristics. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced aggregate particle coating. Surface energy results revealed that <b>foamed</b> bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen. A new compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with <b>foamed</b> bitumen based on the modified locking point was developed. QC 2011042...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects of green <b>foam</b> with black <b>foam</b> and gauze during {{negative}} pressure wound therapy (NPWT), with regard to wound bed appearance and granulation tissue formation, and monitoring of wound exudate. METHOD: Wounds {{on the backs of}} eight pigs underwent 72 hours of NPWT plus either green polyurethane <b>foam</b> with an open pore structure, black polyurethane <b>foam</b> with an open pore structure or saline-moistened AMD gauze. Sections of biopsies from the wound bed, including the overlying dressing, were examined histologically with regard to microdeformation of the wound bed and granulation tissue formation. The force required to remove the wound fillers was measured. RESULTS: Wound exudate and bleeding could be easily seen when using gauze and green <b>foam,</b> but were not visible under the black <b>foam.</b> Such visibility facilitates monitoring of the wound status. No difference was found in the quantity or characteristics of the granulation tissue formed under the green <b>foam</b> or black <b>foam.</b> Both green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> resulted in more pronounced granulation tissue formation than gauze under negative pressure. There was also more leucocyte infiltration and tissue disorganisation under green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> than under gauze. All three wound fillers created microdeformation within the wound bed surface. Similar forces were required to remove green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> (5. 0 ± 0. 6 N for green <b>foam</b> and 4. 0 ± 0. 4 N for black <b>foam),</b> while less force was needed for gauze (2. 1 ± 0. 2 N). This may be a result of tissue ingrowth into the <b>foam</b> (357 ± 12 µm for green <b>foam</b> and 362 ± 14 µm for black <b>foam),</b> but not into gauze (0 µm), as shown by examination of biopsy sections from the wound bed. CONCLUSION: Green <b>foam</b> and black <b>foam</b> have similar biological effects on the wound bed. Bleeding and exudate can be more easily monitored when using green <b>foam</b> or gauze. Differences in the wound bed tissue morphology when using <b>foam</b> or gauze plus NPWT support clinical observations that granulation tissue under <b>foam</b> is thick but fragile, whereas that under <b>foam</b> is thinner but denser.

30|$|The early {{test data}} pertained to foamability behavior, i.e., pore volume {{injected}} before <b>foaming</b> started (delay in <b>foaming)</b> {{and between the}} start of <b>foaming</b> to reaching peak pressure drop (time to peak <b>foaming).</b> These data are not shown in Fig.  6 since those attributes cannot be determined in bulk <b>foam</b> stability tests. Bulk tests can only be used for testing <b>foam</b> stability and decay after the generation and peak <b>foaming</b> conditions.
