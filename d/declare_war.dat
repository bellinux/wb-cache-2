5|$|September 3: Great Britain and France <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Nazi Germany in {{response}} to its invasion of Poland, beginning World War II.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by anti-war {{officials}} in Istanbul to apologise for the incident were botched by Enver. The British quickly retaliated with naval {{attacks in the}} Dardanelles, the Russians declared war on 2 November, followed by the British and the French three days later. The Ottomans did not officially <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> until 11 November.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 205 BC, Rhodes {{had been}} {{significantly}} weakened by these raids, and Philip saw his chance {{to go forward with}} the second part of his plan, direct military confrontation. He convinced the cities of Hierapytna and Olous and other cities in Eastern Crete to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> against Rhodes.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, {{several states}} <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Germany in late August 1914, with Italy <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on August 27, 1916, the United States <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Germany on April 6, 1917 and Greece <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Germany in July 1917.|$|R
5|$|December 11: The {{same day}} after Germany and Italy <b>declares</b> <b>war</b> on the United States, the United States <b>declares</b> <b>war</b> on Germany and Italy.|$|R
50|$|The table below {{lists the}} five wars {{in which the}} United States has {{formally}} <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against eleven foreign nations. The only country against which the United States has <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> more than once is Germany, against which the United States has <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> twice (though a case could be made for Hungary as a successor state to Austria-Hungary).|$|R
5|$|Japan {{maintains}} one of {{the largest}} military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is an unusual military that has never fired shots outside Japan. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} {{to the point where it}} might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> but the rest of the cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests. Jefferson never asked for or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{broke out}} in September 1939 with the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Germany. As in the First World War, a relatively-small BEF was sent to France and hastily evacuated from Dunkirk as the German forces swept through the Low Countries and across France in May 1940.|$|E
50|$|On 11 December 1941, Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> {{against the}} United States, {{the same day}} that the United States <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Germany and Italy.|$|R
50|$|After Germany <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Russia, France {{with its}} {{alliance}} with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on France.|$|R
50|$|In December 1941, after Germany <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the United States, Bulgaria {{followed}} the German lead. On December 13, 1941, Bulgaria broke diplomatic relations and <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the United States.|$|R
5|$|These attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia {{and several}} other states to {{formally}} <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Italy declined to join its Triple Alliance partners Germany and Austria-Hungary when they declared war against the Entente Powers, opting instead to remain neutral. Pressure from the United Kingdom and France swayed Italy to sign the secret Treaty of London on 26 April 1915. In the agreement, Italy promised to leave the Triple Alliance and <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> against its former allies within a month in return for territorial gains {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Brazil revoked its {{neutrality}} in the {{war between}} the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b> At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E
2500|$|... 1941â€“1945: World War II: On December 8, 1941, the United States <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against Japan in {{response}} to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. On December 11, Germany <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against the United States.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{shelling}} of Odessa, Russia <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914. The British Navy attacked the Dardanelles on 3 November. Britain and France <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on 5 November.|$|R
50|$|Four {{months later}} on 17 December 1718, France, Britain and Austria <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Spain, {{starting}} the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Netherlands joined them later, <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Spain in August 1719.|$|R
5|$|Citizens were {{organized}} {{on the basis}} of centuries and tribes, which would each gather into their own assemblies. The Comitia Centuriata ("Centuriate Assembly") was the assembly of the centuries (i.e., soldiers). The president of the Comitia Centuriata was usually a consul. The centuries would vote, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority of the centuries. The Comitia Centuriata would elect magistrates who had geimperium powers (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> and ratify the results of a census. It also served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.|$|E
5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on each other, starting World War I.|$|E
50|$|Austria-Hungary's {{invasion}} of Serbia resulted in Russia <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> {{on the country}} and Germany in turn <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Russia, setting off {{the beginning of the}} clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} list denotes dates {{on which}} nations <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Axis powers, or on which an Axis power <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on them. Nepal was formally independent. Indian Empire had a status less independent than the Dominions.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World <b>War,</b> {{neighbouring}} Italy <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the United Kingdom, San Marino {{was reported}} to have joined Italy in <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Britain, but the Sammarinese government later denied these reports.Then when Italy surrendered San Marino declared neutrality. On 26 June 1944, the Allied Forces under British command erroneously bombed San Marino in the belief that it was harbouring German forces. On 21 September 1944 San Marino <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Germany.|$|R
5|$|Negan murders Glenn and Abraham {{to coerce}} Rick's loyalty. Rick {{initially}} submits, but Michonne persuades him to fight back, and recruits a community called the Scavengers for help. Meanwhile, Rosita and Eugene make a bullet to kill Negan. When this fails, Negan forcibly recruits Eugene as a Savior. Separately, Carol and Morgan befriend Ezekiel of the Kingdom, another community, while Maggie and Rosita rally the Hilltop. Alexandria is {{attacked by the}} Saviors, aided by the turncoat Scavengers, but the Kingdom and Hilltop defend Alexandria. The three communities <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on the Saviors.|$|E
5|$|Political parties {{gather in}} the National Assembly, which {{consists}} of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly {{has the power to}} enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the Prime Minister and other ministers, <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Sleaze-busting package: Following {{the cash}} for honours scandal, Brown {{said he would}} reduce sleaze, {{which led to the}} belief that Brown would {{introduce}} a new Ministerial Code that would set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers. Brown said that he intended to strip the Prime Minister of some the powers conferred on it by royal prerogativeincluding the ability to <b>declare</b> <b>war.</b> This would give Parliament more powers and rights to vet and veto appointments to senior public positions, in a bid to eliminate cronyism.|$|E
50|$|On December 11, 1941, Italy <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the United States in {{response}} to that country's declaration of war upon the Empire of Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor four days earlier. Germany also <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the U.S. the same day. The US immediately responded by <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Germany and Italy, thus thrusting the United States in fighting two major fronts across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|March 22, 2004, {{killing of}} Sheikh Yassin. Yassin, then {{an old man}} {{restricted}} to a wheel-chair due to his lifelong paralysis {{was killed in an}} Israeli missile strike. Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi replaced him as the leader of Hamas. On March 28, Rantissi stated in a speech given at The Islamic University in Gaza that [...] "America <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against God. Sharon <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against God, and God <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> against America, Bush and Sharon".|$|R
50|$|Marshal GuiltorreThe supreme {{commander}} of Giganos. Though he <b>declares</b> <b>war</b> on the Earth Federation, he truly treasures the Earth for its beauty, eventually questioning himself whether <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> {{was really the}} right option, moments before he was murdered by Dorchenov.|$|R
5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British initially to propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement and, when that failed, to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> on Spain. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Sydney was in Alexandria harbour on 10 June 1940, {{and that}} evening learned of Italy's {{intention}} to <b>declare</b> <b>war</b> at midnight. By 01:00 on 11 June, all ships in harbour had departed {{to search for}} Italian warships in position to attack Alexandria, and secure the sea lines of communication in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean. The Australian cruiser {{was involved in the}} westbound sweep, and sailed as far as the Gulf of Taranto during the four-day operation. Apart from an unsuccessful depth charge attack on a suspected submarine during the afternoon of 13 June, Sydney did not encounter any enemy vessels.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense from America, since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could <b>declare</b> <b>war,</b> the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|... 20 April: President McKinley signs {{a congressional}} joint {{resolution}} <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> against Spain. It includes the Teller Amendment asserting U.S. intentions in <b>declaring</b> <b>war</b> on Spain exclude exercising [...] "sovereignty, jurisdiction or control" [...] over Cuba, [...] "except for pacification thereof".|$|R
25|$|On 23 August 1944, Romania {{left the}} Axis Powers and <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Germany, and allowed Soviet forces to cross its {{territory}} to reach Bulgaria. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Bulgaria and invaded. Within three days, the Soviets occupied the northeastern part of Bulgaria {{along with the}} key port cities of Varna and Burgas. Meanwhile, on 5 of September, Bulgaria <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Nazi Germany. The Bulgarian Army was ordered to offer no resistance.|$|R
50|$|On June 5, 1942, the United States Congress <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> upon Bulgaria. Bulgaria was neutral during 1939-1941, but on March 1, 1941, Bulgaria {{signed the}} Tripartite Pact and officially joined the Axis bloc. Following this, the Bulgarian {{government}} <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on the United Kingdom and the United States on December 13, 1941. The United States officially <b>declared</b> <b>war</b> on Bulgaria on June 5, 1942. The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, and other Bulgarian cities, were bombed by Allied aircraft in 1943 and 1944.|$|R
