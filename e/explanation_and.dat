5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and <b>explanation</b> <b>and</b> reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify associated conditions and treat them.|$|E

A similar breathing pattern {{can be used to}} prevent normal vomiting. Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents.|$|E

5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible <b>explanation,</b> <b>and</b> {{the future of the}} dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural <b>explanation</b> <b>and</b> demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational <b>explanation</b> <b>and</b> would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical <b>explanation</b> (<b>and</b> naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, {{opened up the}} possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be done. Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining {{the possibility of a}}tomic bombs, and warning of the danger of a German nuclear weapon project. He convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into nuclear fission, which became the Manhattan Project.|$|E

At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be achieved.

At the time, few scientists in the United States thought that an atomic bomb was practical, but the possibility that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons sufficiently concerned scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, that they drafted the Einstein–Szilard letter to warn President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This prompted preliminary research in the United States, beginning in late 1939.|$|E

On 20 December 1941, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, the objective of which was to produce reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate plutonium from the uranium, and ultimately to design and build an atomic bomb. This became the Manhattan Project. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts.|$|E

5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide <b>explanation</b> <b>and</b> provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E
