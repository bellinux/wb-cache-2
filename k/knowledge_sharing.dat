Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} few years, argumentation systems have been gaining {{increasing}} importance in several areas of Artificial Intelligence, mainly {{as a vehicle for}} facilitating rationally justifiable decision making when handling incomplete and potentially inconsistent information. Argumentation provides a sound model for dialectical reasoning, which underlies discussions among students when solving tasks collaboratively in a CSCL environment. In this setting, we identify the problem of constructing <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> and its related <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Awareness. While <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> refers to the common knowledge students acquire when they work in a collaborative activity, <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Awareness is associated with the consciousness on the <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> that a particular student has. This paper presents a novel approach to model <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> construction and the associated <b>Shared</b> <b>Knowledge</b> Awareness through an automated argumentation system. ...|$|R

500|$|However Johnson was not {{the first}} apothecary or {{physician}} to organise botanical expeditions to systematise their local flora. In Italy Ulysse Aldrovandi (1522 – 1605) organised an expedition to the Sibylline mountains in Umbria in 1557, and compiled a local Flora. He then began to disseminate his findings amongst other European scholars, forming an early network of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing</b> [...] "molti amici in molti luoghi" [...] (many friends in many places), including Charles de l'Écluse (Clusius) (1526 – 1609) at Montpellier and Jean de Brancion at Malines. Between them they started developing Latin names for plants, in addition to their common names. The exchange of information and specimens between scholars was often associated with the founding of botanical gardens (above), and to this end Aldrovandi founded one of the earliest at his university in Bologna, the Orto Botanico di Bologna in 1568.|$|E

We showed that participants acquired <b>shared</b> <b>knowledge</b> during the cooperation and that most of this information was correct. Further results indicate that if collaborating partners have knowledge in common, their overall problem solutions are better than if they lack any kind of shared information.

40|$|Abstract- Knowledge is {{a product}} out of interaction. In online {{community}} learning, learners are encouraged {{to ask questions and}} discuss answers with each others. The value of participation and sharing during learning is emphasized. However, interactions between learners and between learner and instructor address a problem the instructor cannot be online all the time and it is not possible for the instructor to deal with lots of questions proposed from learners in a timely manner. Therefore, there is a need of an automated FAQ system to support learning efficiency of community learning that everyone in the learning system can <b>share</b> <b>knowledge</b> with and learn from each others.

2500|$|One other {{use that}} is being {{discussed}} {{is the use of}} social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to [...] "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become [...] "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and <b>knowledge</b> <b>sharing.</b>|$|E

Social media integration as an access point is a very useful and mutually beneficial tool for users and providers.

Through social media people are directed to, or provided with, information by people they know.
