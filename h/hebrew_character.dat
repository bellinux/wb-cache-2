500|$|Rabbi Joseph Schwarz (1850) who {{had lived}} in Palestine for 16 years, {{identified}} the village of Abulnita, 'about 2 English miles east of Shechem', as the site 'where Joseph lies buried'. Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century described their impressions of the site in travelogues. John Ross Browne (1853) writes: 'We also visited the reputed site of Joseph's Tomb. A rude stone building covers the pretended sepulcher; but the best authorities deny that there was any evidence that Joseph was buried here.' Howard Crosby also visited the site during 1851. He designated it, 'the so-called tomb of Joseph,' describing it as 'a plain white Santon's tomb, or Wely, such as is everywhere seen in Mohammedan countries, excepting that this one is roofless, and consequently lacks the usual white dome. In the interior, a vine grows from a corner, and spreads upon a trellis over the tomb, forming a pleasant bower.' Louis Félicien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy and Edouard de Warren (1853) describe it as 'a small Mussulman oualy (weli, i.e. chapel) [...] said to be the tomb of Joseph,' noting it was just to the east of what the Arabs called Bir-Yakub, Jacob's Well. Hackett noted in 1857 that the tomb is placed diagonally to the walls, instead of parallel, and found 'the walls of the interior covered with the names of pilgrims, representing almost every land and language; though the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> was the most prominent one.' [...] Thomson noted in 1883 that 'the entire building is fast crumbling to ruin, presenting a most melancholy spectacle.' Being exposed to the weather, 'it has no pall or votive offering of any kind, nor any marks of respect such as are seen at the sepulchres of the most insignificant Muslim saints.' During the late 19th century, sources report the Jewish custom of burning small articles such as gold lace, shawls or handkerchiefs, in the two low pillars {{at either end of the}} tomb. This was done in [...] "memory of the patriarch who sleeps beneath".|$|E

"No more of that," [...] {{said the}} Jew, {{changing}} colour; and drawing forth his writing materials in haste, {{as if to}} stop the conversation, he began to write upon {{a piece of paper}} which he supported {{on the top of his}} yellow cap, without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he delivered the scroll, which was in the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character,</b> to the Pilgrim, saying, [...] "In the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew, Kirjath Jairam of Lombardy; give him this scroll--he hath on sale six Milan harnesses, the worst would suit a crowned head--ten goodly steeds, the worst might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of these he will give thee thy choice, with every thing else that can furnish thee forth for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt return them safely--unless thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their value to the owner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mirah {{could not}} ask herself another question--could not do {{anything}} else than put her cold trembling hands in her pocket for her portemonnaie and hold it out. Lapidoth grasped it at once, pressed her fingers the while, said, [...] "Good-bye, my little girl--to-morrow then!" [...] and left her. He had not taken many steps before he looked carefully into all {{the folds of the}} purse, found two half-sovereigns and odd silver, and, pasted against the folding cover, a bit of paper on which Ezra had inscribed, in a beautiful <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character,</b> the name of his mother, the days of her birth, marriage, and death, and the prayer, [...] "May Mirah be delivered from evil." [...] It was Mirah's liking to have this little inscription on many articles that she used. The father read it, and had a quick vision of his marriage day, and the bright, unblamed young fellow he was at that time; teaching many things, but expecting by-and-by to get money more easily by writing; and very fond of his beautiful bride Sara--crying when she expected him to cry, and reflecting every phase of her feeling with mimetic susceptibility. Lapidoth had traveled a long way from that young self, and thought of all that this inscription signified with an unemotional memory, which was like the ocular perception of a touch to one who has lost the sense of touch, or like morsels on an untasting palate, having shape and grain, but no flavor. Among the things we may gamble away in a lazy selfish life is the capacity for ruth, compunction, or any unselfish regret--which we may come to long for as one in slow death longs to feel laceration, rather than be conscious of a widening margin where consciousness once was. Mirah's purse was a handsome one--a gift to her, which she had been unable to reflect about giving away--and Lapidoth presently found himself outside of his reverie, considering what the purse would fetch in addition to the sum it contained, and what prospect there was of his being able to get more from his daughter without submitting to adopt a penitential form of life under the eyes of that formidable son. On such a subject his susceptibilities were still lively.|$|E

50|$|A famous rabbinic dictum {{states that}} scribes {{are to be}} careful to have certain columns begin with fixed words, known by their mnemonics, בי"ה שמ"ו. These, too, {{can be found in}} their {{designated}} places, each letter commencing the word of that column. Such was also the practice in Yemen. For example: The <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> bet (ב) represents the first word in the Torah, בראשית (Gen. 1:1); the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> yod (י) represents יהודה אתה יודוך (Gen. 49:8); the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> he (ה) represents הבאים אחריהם בים (Exo. 14:28); the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> shin (ש) represents שמר ושמעת (Deut. 12:28); the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> mim (מ) represents מוצא שפתיך תשמר (Deut. 23:24); and, finally, the <b>Hebrew</b> <b>character</b> waw (ו) represents ואעידה בם (Deut. 31:28). Aside from the first word in this mnemonic device taken from Psalm 68:5, the other letters come to represent the only places in the entire Torah where the column begins {{in the middle of a}} verse, whereas in all other columns, the start of a new verse always commences a new column. Likewise, in Parashat Shemini (Leviticus 10:16), a tradition passed down by the scribes was to ensure that each scribe when copying from a master text is careful to write the first דרש (derosh) at the very end of the line, while the second דרש (derash) be written at the forefront of the next line. In the Yemenite Torah scroll brought out from Yemen, now belonging to the Azriel ben Saadia Tzadok (Saleh) of Benei Barak, from which a Tikkun Soferim was made in five small pocket volumes to facilitate the accurate transmission of the same masorah by scribes, the first word דרש is, indeed, found at the very end of line # 14, whereas the second word דרש is found written at the forefront of line # 15.|$|E
