50|$|PDF/A is an ISO-standardized {{version of}} the Portable Document Format (PDF) {{specialized}} {{for use in the}} archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents. PDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features ill-suited to long-term archiving, such as font linking (as opposed to font embedding) and encryption. The ISO requirements for PDF/A <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> include color management guidelines, support for embedded fonts, and a user interface for reading embedded annotations.|$|R
5000|$|Even more {{problems}} are connected with complex file formats of various word processors, spreadsheets and graphics software. To alleviate the problem, many software companies distribute free <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> for their proprietary file formats (one example is Adobe's Acrobat Reader). The other solution {{is the development}} of standardized non-proprietary file formats (such as HTML and OpenDocument), and electronic documents for specialized uses have specialized formats [...] - [...] the specialized electronic articles in physics use TeX or PostScript.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{electronic}} discovery vendors {{had been}} contracted to convert native files into TIFF images (for example 10 images for a 10-page Microsoft Word document) with a load file {{for use in}} image-based discovery review database applications. Increasingly, database review applications have embedded native <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> with TIFF-capabilities. With both native and image file capabilities, it could either increase or decrease the total necessary storage, since there may be multiple formats and files associated with each individual native file. Deployment, storage, and best practices are becoming especially critical and necessary to maintain cost-effective strategies.|$|R
5000|$|Miller columns {{are most}} well {{known today as}} the “Columns view” mode of the Mac OS X Finder, {{as well as the}} [...] "Browser" [...] view in iTunes. The columns in Finder descend {{directly}} from the NeXTSTEP <b>File</b> <b>Viewer's</b> use of Miller columns going back to 1986. The GNUstep project continues to offer a Miller column browser that closely follows the NeXT approach, bringing the advantages of a Column browser to Linux, BSD, and other operating systems with large tree structures. The iPod's browsing of categories and audio file tag attributes is reminiscent of column browsing, but only one column is visible at a time.|$|R
50|$|For {{more complex}} or {{proprietary}} <b>file</b> formats, <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> are usually {{provided by the}} same companies that make the editing software using those formats. Viewers are usually distributed free of charge, while editors have to be bought. For example, the full version of Adobe Acrobat {{can be used to}} create content for most computer platforms. To ensure that people can access the documents created with Adobe Acrobat, the software publisher created a viewer program, the Acrobat Reader, and made it available for free. Microsoft also makes viewers for Word and PowerPoint documents freely available. These viewer applications allow the file format to be readable on all supported operating-systems, free of charge, making the commercial product a more attractive solution.|$|R
50|$|A <b>file</b> <b>viewer</b> is {{application}} software that presents the data {{stored in a}} computer file in a human-friendly form. The file contents are generally displayed on the screen, {{or they may be}} printed. Also, they may be read aloud using speech synthesis.|$|E
50|$|Pre-installed {{software}} {{includes an}} e-mail client, a rudimentary web browser and Microsoft Office <b>file</b> <b>viewer.</b> It also includes support for MP3 and AAC playback at full quality (44.1 kHz, 16 bits, stereo), and the retail package includes stereo headphones with hands-free functionality.|$|E
50|$|Since Gnome Commander {{supports}} GnomeVFS, allowing {{access to}} network interfaces such as FTP, SMB, WebDAV and SSH. There is a bookmark system for folders and a built-in <b>file</b> <b>viewer</b> for text and image documents. An integrated command line enables commands directly as input to a terminal.|$|E
50|$|In 1992 XTree for Windows was released. The product dropped {{many of the}} {{features}} liked in the DOS versions, with undeletion and file editing particularly noticeable by their absence. The program also took considerably longer to load than both DOS Xtree and other Windows file managers, and operations like viewing files were slower. Despite this, features like native support for file compression and {{a wide range of}} <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> made it the most feature complete Windows file manager of that year. It was not a success for the company. In 1993, the XTree Company was sold to Central Point Software, which was in turn acquired by Symantec in 1994, and in 1995 production of XTree products was halted.|$|R
50|$|XTree was {{supplemented}} by the enhanced XTreePro in 1988, which added features {{for working with}} multiple disk drives, speed improvements, and brought the keyboard commands {{more in line with}} other common DOS programs. A version of XTreePro with Novell NetWare connectivity debuted in late 1988. XTreeProGold/XTreeGold succeeded Xtree Pro in 1989, adding pull-down menus to enhance the interface, additional <b>file</b> <b>viewers,</b> and the choice of a Norton Commander-style split pane between locations on different disks. The first GUI-enabled XTree product was XTreeMac, also launched in 1989, which brought the XTree interface metaphors to the Macintosh System as a Finder replacement. While the Macintosh System software already had competent file management, XTreeMac made it easier to move and copy files and added undeletion and enhanced file finding tools.|$|R
50|$|Different {{software}} tools can extract {{the data from}} the memory image. One could use specialized and automated forensic software products or generic <b>file</b> <b>viewers</b> such as any hex editor to search for characteristics of file headers. The advantage of the hex editor is the deeper insight into the memory management, but working with a hex editor means a lot of handwork and file system as well as file header knowledge. In contrast, specialized forensic software simplifies the search and extracts the data but may not find everything. AccessData, Sleuthkit, and EnCase, to mention only some, are forensic software products to analyze memory images. Since there is no tool that extracts all possible information, it is advisable to use two or more tools for examination. There is currently (February 2010) no software solution to get all evidences from flash memories.|$|R
