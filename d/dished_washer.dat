40|$|We {{present the}} beam joint using half-moon-shaped bearing bolts as an {{effective}} fastener between high-strength steel members. In order to give a half-moon-shaped bearing bolt filling force, {{it is necessary to}} use a washer with restoring force such as a <b>dish</b> <b>washer.</b> Hence, in this study, loading test and F. E. M analysis of a <b>dish</b> <b>washer</b> is performed to clarify behavior of a <b>dish</b> <b>washer.</b> Also, repeat loading test of a beam joint using this jointing method is performed, self-filling function and joint stiffness are investigated...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} possibilities and limitations of the hot-fill principle applied in washing machines and dish washing equipment. The study started with literature research, showing the washing performance of hot-fill washing machines to be generally poorer than the performance of cold-fill equipment. Moreover, washing machines specifically adapted to hot-fill have longer pay-back periods. For hot-fill <b>dish</b> <b>washers</b> no unequivocal measuring results relating to energy consumption and dish washing performance were available. That's why the study further focused on <b>dish</b> <b>washers.</b> A number of energy consumption measurements and washing performance tests at various operating modes have shown the greatest energy cost cuts to be attained in filling a standard <b>dish</b> <b>washer</b> with hot water. The washing and drying performance is not affected by hot-fill. From supplementary measurements it appeared that storage-type water heaters are most suitable for this application. With this type of appliance energy consumption is lowest. Dimensioning of the hot water piping is important. Only if the sizing is kept to a minimum, will there be any saving of primary energy, when running the 65 degrees C standard program. Application of hot-fill <b>dish</b> <b>washers</b> will contribute to a reduction of environmental acidification. Given the current use of the various washing programs in the Netherlands hot-fill will also help reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R

In East Asia, the species has caused lethal brain infections in young and otherwise healthy individuals. The fungus has been known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, and as a lung colonist in people with cystic fibrosis in Europe. In 2002, an outbreak of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in women who had received contaminated steroid injections at North Carolina hospitals.|$|R

30|$|In this work, {{we compare}} {{published}} the approaches {{we are aware}} of (Chrysopoulos et al. 2014; Truong et al. 2013; Barbato et al. 2011) and extensions from these on three datasets measured over 2 years in households located in Switzerland, Canada and the UK. We implemented these approaches into a common framework and compare their fitness in predicting the usage patterns of the appliances. In doing so, we focused on appliances, whose usage is mainly driven by user behavior and whose switch-on time is flexible. In the relevant literature such appliances are commonly referred to as “shiftable loads”. Examples for such loads are washing machine, <b>dish</b> <b>washer</b> or tumble dryer. The Python source code for the experiments can be obtained from the authors upon request.|$|R
