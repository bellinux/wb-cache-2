On March 12, 1912, he enlisted in the French military and received his military pilot's license at Avord, France, in January 1913.

He originally flew reconnaissance and night-time bombing missions while assigned to fly prewar Bleriots with Escadrille (squadron) BL30. The night flying missions were some of the first ever, and his experience probably accounted for this assignment. Certainly it saved his life, when on October 30, 1914, his engine was destroyed by a direct hit from 77mm cannon fire.

5000|$|Like other stick insects, Pterinoxylus spinulosus is a herbivore, and {{in captivity}} {{it can be}} {{maintained}} on a diet of guava leaves (Psidium sp.). It has several modes of defence against predation. The first is crypsis; the insect is nocturnal in its habits and both adults and nymphs spend the day stationary in a resting position with the front legs extended forward beside the head {{and the other two}} pairs of legs folded tightly to resemble side twigs on a <b>dead</b> <b>stick.</b> This arrangement of limbs conceals the head and may deceive a visually-hunting predator so that the insect remains unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|N502BD {{ran into}} {{problems}} of its own. Early models used a variable speed belt drive system to transfer {{power from the}} engine to the propeller shaft. This was removed from N502BD and it suddenly began exhibiting a serious vibration problem during taxi tests. Experts were called in, and a freewheel clutch and additional bearings added to correct the problem, {{but it was not}} until March 26, 1973 that N502BD flew. From then on the test program seemed to go more smoothly, although this aircraft also suffered two <b>dead</b> <b>stick</b> landings, one from a pinched fuel line occurred while the plane was being observed by the Popular Science author, and another due to metal in a new engine's cylinder.|$|R
50|$|The black-breasted buzzard {{is usually}} monogamous, forming lifelong pair-bonds. The buzzard nests in trees of notable height and girth, {{larger and more}} {{independent}} from others generally available. The trees may be dead with bare exposed limbs, or live and foliated, with nests positioned in prominent forks {{high up in the}} canopies. Both parents contribute equally to nest-building and often work together in unison on the nest structure. Nests are constructed from <b>dead</b> <b>sticks</b> and leafy branches, with materials gathered from the ground or broken off trees and carried to the nest site in feet or beak. Nest dimensions have been measured at 1.2m long x 0.8m wide x 0.4m deep. Nest dimensions are larger than that of any other raptor species, including the larger-bodied wedge-tail eagle.|$|R

An insect may be made in one of its transformations to resemble a <b>dead</b> <b>stick,</b> or a leaf, or a lichen, or a stone, so as to be somewhat less easily found by its enemies; or if this would make it too strong, an occasional variety of the species may have this advantage conferred on it; or if this would be still too much, one sex of a certain variety. Probably there is scarcely a dash of colour on the wing or body of which the choice would be quite arbitrary, or which might not affect its duration for thousands of years.' ...|$|R
60|$|With this {{he resumed}} his investigations. When {{the last of}} the boughs had been removed he found a hole in the ice about {{a foot and a half}} wide and a trifle longer. Along one end and both sides small <b>dead</b> <b>sticks</b> had been driven into the mud and close to the edges of the hole. These were about four inches apart and formed a little pen with one end open. Close to one side and {{projecting}} beyond the pen through the open end was a long freshly cut green poplar stick fastened about two inches above the bottom. The water was shallow and presently he made out a steel trap dimly outlined well inside the pen quite close to the poplar stick, the chain fastened to one of the pen stakes.|$|R
