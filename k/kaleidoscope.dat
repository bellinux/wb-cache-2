5|$|The {{music on}} <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds in the songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas. Miguel titled <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Dream {{as a metaphor for}} life and wanted the songs to reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi, which featured Hamasaki in a <b>kaleidoscope</b> with several clones of her {{in a variety of}} colorful clothing. To promote the single, it appeared on several remix and greatest hits compilation albums, in addition to various live concert tours conducted by Hamasaki. It was used as the official theme song for a peach water commercial that was advertised in Japan. The song was covered by Chinese recording artist An Youqi in 2006, and released as a single.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>kaleidoscopes</b> are mass-produced from {{inexpensive}} materials, {{and intended}} as children's toys. At {{the other extreme}} are handmade pieces that display fine craftsmanship. Craft galleries often carry a few <b>kaleidoscopes,</b> while other enterprises specialize in them, carrying dozens of different types from different artists and craftspeople. Most handmade <b>kaleidoscopes</b> are now made in Russia and Italy, following {{a long tradition of}} glass craftsmanship in those countries.|$|R
5000|$|A Beacon from Mars is <b>Kaleidoscope's</b> second album. It was {{published}} in January 1968 by Epic Records along with the single [...] "I Found Out" [...] b/w [...] "Rampè Rampè". At {{the time it was}} released it received good reviews, but like <b>Kaleidoscope's</b> other albums, it was commercially unsuccessful.|$|R

5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a <b>kaleidoscope</b> of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The color is used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|Due to the band's slow progress, Shields {{contemplated}} relocating to New York City, {{where members}} of his family were living at the time. However, Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster had decided to establish his own record label, <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Sound and persuaded My Bloody Valentine to record and release an EP. The New Record by My Bloody Valentine, produced by Foster, was released in October 1986 and was a minor success, peaking at number 22 on the UK Indie Chart upon its release. On the strength of the release, the band began performing more frequent shows, later developing a small following and travelling outside London for live performances, supporting and opening for bands such as The Membranes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kaleidoscope</b> Dream {{was first}} {{released}} in vinyl LP format on September 25, {{in an effort}} by RCA to make the deadline for the Grammy Awards' eligibility period without charting prematurely on lower sales. The following week, it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 71,000 copies in the US. It was Miguel's first album {{to be released in}} the United Kingdom, where it spent 15 weeks on the country's R chart, peaking at number 13. By February 20, 2013, the record had charted for 20 weeks on the Billboard 200 and sold 321,400 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in June 2015, with 535,000 copies sold in the US at that point.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} several independent EPs {{and played}} primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records {{at a concert}} in 1999. The ensuing record deal saw the band's only commercial release, a critically acclaimed album entitled <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Superior, in 2000. Shortly after, the band left Sparrow and drifted {{out of the public}} eye. A final album, entitled The Rise of Modern Simulation was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003. Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands, namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons.|$|E
5|$|They have {{received}} two Grammy nominations in 2007 and 2010 respectively and have recorded a live CD/DVD box set entitled Survive, <b>Kaleidoscope,</b> which {{was released on}} May 27, 2008. From late February to early May the band recorded their sixth studio album entitled Lost in the Sound of Separation, which was released on September 2, 2008, and peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200. Their last album Ø (Disambiguation) was released on November 9, 2010, and is the first without the band's last original member, drummer and vocalist Aaron Gillespie after parting ways with the band earlier in the year.|$|E

5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want Is You in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Dream.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} <b>Kaleidoscope</b> Dream, Miguel {{embarked}} on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26, 2012. He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a mirror. In concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and <b>kaleidoscope</b> effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

The band would end 1968 in a big way at a New Year's show at the Shrine Auditorium, in Los Angeles, with Bob Hite riding a painted purple dayglo elephant to the stage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kaleidoscope</b> was {{released}} on 1 August 1980 by record label Polydor. The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart, the highest position the band has achieved to date.|$|E
2500|$|Other H2 {{hyperbolic}} <b>kaleidoscopes</b> can {{be constructed}} from higher order polygons. Like triangle groups these <b>kaleidoscopes</b> can be identified by a cyclic sequence of mirror intersection orders around the fundamental domain, as (a b c d ...), or equivalently in orbifold notation as *abcd.... Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams for these polygonal <b>kaleidoscopes</b> {{can be seen as}} a degenerate (n-1)-simplex fundamental domains, with a cyclic of branches order a,b,c... and the remaining n*(n-3)/2 branches are labeled as infinite (∞) representing the non-intersecting mirrors. The only nonhyperbolic example is Euclidean symmetry four mirrors in a square or rectangle as , [...] (orbifold *2222). Another branch representation for non-intersecting mirrors by Vinberg gives infinite branches as dotted or dashed lines, so this diagram can be shown as , with the four order-2 branches suppressed around the perimeter.|$|R
