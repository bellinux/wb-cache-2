In this rebuttal I give a brief overview of my model of Russian aspect and then address the criticisms made by Zaliznjak & Mikaèljan. I begin by examining the four assumptions stated by Zaliznjak & Mikaèljan, which I find to be unnecessary and lacking in theoretical <b>gounding.</b> Their assumption that aspectual correlation is uniformly directed from perfective to imperfective is particularly problematic. I compare Zaliznjak & Mikaèljan’s assumption with the single assumption my work is based on, namely that linguistic cognition is not fundamentally different from general cognition, and present the entailments of this assumption and what they mean for an investigation of Russian aspect. I then present four further problems with Zaliznjak & Mikaèljan’s model of Russian aspect: the alleged transfer of meaning from perfective to imperfective, the criteria for identifying prototypical prefixed perfectives, their claim that overlap and emptiness can be equated, and their postulation of deprefixation...|$|R
40|$|Through a {{qualitative}} research approach, {{this study aims}} to understand how thirteen secondary mathematics {{students who do not}} do well in mathematics learning cope with it in a classroom. The participants included a total of thirteen students in a Singaporean mathematics classroom at secondary school level. Observational and interview data were collected over a period of 6 weeks to understand the strategies formulated by these students to cope with mathematics learning. <b>Gounded</b> theory analytical methods were used in the analysis of the data. From this study, three main categories of defence mechanisms utilised by these thirteen students evolved – Avoidance, Denial and Apathy. “Avoidance”, the stage where the students attempt to avoid mathematics learning, is supported by the defence mechanisms of “Aim Inhibition”, “Compensation” and “Displacement”. They usually begin such avoidance on an individual basis and may graduate to group actions in the form of “Collaborative Avoidance”, which is supported by the defence mechanisms of “Displacement” and “Identification”. Students may also use the coping mechanism of “Denial” where they imagine and maintain the picture of them doing well in future mathematics assessments. This defence mechanism is complemented by “Suppression”, “Repression”, “Fantasy” and “Deceit”. “Apathy” the stage where they start to resist against mathematics learning openly, consists of “Minimisation”, “Rationalisation”, “Provocation” and “Dramatization The findings have implications for the development of theory, practice and future researc...|$|R
40|$|En nombre de Dios In the “Introduction” to {{the book}} En nombre de Dios. La empresa misionera frente a la alteridad, Flavia Cuturi points out how along the last decades {{cultural}} anthropology has acknowledged that the theories, the conceptual instruments and methods worked out in the West to define and face alterity have a significant debt to the cognitive and practical experiences of missionary action. Anthropologists’ interest {{in the politics of}} evangelization goes beyond the social and cognitive processes (sometimes labelled under the category of “syncretism”) that those politics triggered. Missionary enterprise has started and enacted specific linguistic and cultural dynamics with critical consequences on political and identitarian phenomena. Behind many aspects, the history of everyday missionary action reveals the politics and strategies implemented in communicating missionaries’ own interpretations of the Christian message. The essay by Flavia Cuturi “Reductio ad unam linguam. La violencia protectora en la reductiones jesuitas”, on the Jesuit Missions in the Chiquitania region (Eastern Bolivia) introduces to the border reality of the last missions established right before the suppression of the Jesuit Order. Chiquitano Missions represent exemplar processes of reduction already experienced in other regions, that included both politics of language and communication, through their “reduction” to grammar, and the settlement of Indigenous people from different ethnolinguistic backgrounds to live in shared hamlets.

The impurity resonance photoconductive signal shows a distinct intensity dependence caused by competing bound‐to‐free transitions which saturate differently.
