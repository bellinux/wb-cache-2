50|$|Electrically engaged {{overdrive}} gearboxes were an available {{option on}} all MGBs. The overdrive unit was operational in third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> (until 1977, when overdrive was only operational in fourth) {{but the overall}} ratio in third gear overdrive was roughly the same as <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> direct. The overdrive unit was engaged by a toggle switch located on the dashboard. The switch {{was moved to the}} top of the gearshift knob in 1977. Overdrives were fitted to less than 20% of all MGBs.|$|R
5000|$|Mixing of gearsets can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a third gear ratio of 1.38:1. However, third and <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> are clustered on the counter shaft which was available with two different <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|R

5000|$|Range {{transmissions}} use an [...] "H" [...] pattern {{through a}} narrow range of gears, then a [...] "range" [...] control shifts the [...] "H" [...] pattern {{between high and low}} ranges. For example, an 8-speed range transmission has an H shift pattern with four gears. The first through <b>fourth</b> <b>gears</b> are accessed when low range is selected. To access the fifth through eighth gears, the range selector is moved to high range, and the gear lever again shifted through the first through <b>fourth</b> <b>gear</b> positions. In high range, the first gear position becomes fifth, the second gear position becomes sixth, and so on.|$|R

From July 2006 to September 2008, 80 patients (54 females and 26 males) underwent alar batten cartilage grafting. The patients were divided into three groups: (1) 55 patients with iatrogenic nasal valve collapse (80 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 20 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> (2) 15 patients with posttraumatic nasal valve collapse (45 % i. <b>n.</b> <b>v.,</b> 55 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.),</b> and (3) 10 patients with congenital nasal valve collapse (100 % e. <b>n.</b> <b>v.).</b> Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, 24, and some at 36 months after surgery. The final follow-up was at least 24 months. The results of this study revealed a significant increase in the size of the aperture at the internal or external nasal valve after the application of alar batten grafts. All the patients noted improvement in their nasal airway breathing and in their cosmetic appearance. No major complication was observed. The alar batten graft is a simple, versatile technique for long-term reshaping, repositioning, and reconstruction of the nasal valve collapse...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{correspondence}} P associates {{to every}} subset A ⊆ N a partition P (A) of A and to every game (<b>N,</b> <b>v),</b> the P -restricted game (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) defined by v ¯ (A) = ∑ F ∈ P (A) v (F) for all A ⊆ N. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on P to have inheritance of convexity from (<b>N,</b> <b>v)</b> to (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯). The main condition is a cyclic intersecting sequence free condition. As a consequence, we {{only need to}} verify inheritance of convexity for unanimity games and for the small class of extremal convex games (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> S) (for any 0 ̸ ≠ S ⊆ N) defined for any A ⊆ <b>N</b> by <b>v</b> S (A) = | A ∩ S | − 1 if A ∩ S ≠ 0 ̸, and v S (A) = 0 otherwise. In particular, when (<b>N,</b> <b>v</b> ¯) corresponds to Myerson’s network-restricted game, inheritance of convexity can be verified by this way. For the P min correspondence (P min (A) is built by deleting edges of minimum weight in the subgraph G A of a weighted communication graph G), we show that inheritance of convexity for unanimity games already implies inheritance of convexit...|$|R
