60|$|The {{purposeful}} {{and systematic}} types, {{in common with}} the Individualist and Marxist, regard the Normal Social Life, for all the many thousands of years behind it, as a phase, and as a phase which is now passing, in human experience; and they are prepared for a future society that may be ultimately different right down to its essential relationships from the human past. But they also believe that the forces that have been assailing and disintegrating the Normal Social Life, which have been, on the one hand, producing great accumulations of wealth, private freedom, and ill-defined, irresponsible and socially dangerous power, and, on the other, labour hordes, for the most part urban, without any property or outlook except continuous toil and anxiety, which in England have substituted a <b>dischargeable</b> agricultural labourer for the independent peasant almost completely, and in America seem to be arresting any general development of the Normal Social Life at all, are forces of wide and indefinite possibility that need to be controlled by a collective effort implying a collective design, deflected from merely injurious consequences and organised for a new human welfare upon new lines. They agree with that class of thinking I have distinguished as the Conservators in their recognition of vast contemporary disorders and their denial of the essential beneficence of change. But while the former seem to regard all novelty and innovation as a mere inundation to be met, banked back, defeated and survived, these more hopeful and adventurous minds would rather regard contemporary change as amounting on the whole to the tumultuous and almost catastrophic opening-up of possible new channels, the violent opportunity of vast, deep, new ways to great unprecedented human ends, ends that are neither feared nor evaded.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{student loans}} are rarely <b>dischargeable</b> in bankruptcy, and {{typically}} lenders provide student loans without requiring security. This stands {{in contrast to}} lenders requiring borrowers to have an equity stake in a comparably-sized real estate loan, as described above, secured by both a down payment and a mortgage. An explanation for the willingness of creditors to provide unsecured student loans is that, in a practical sense, American student loans are secured by the borrower's future earnings. This is so since creditors may legally garnish wages when a borrower defaults.|$|E
5000|$|The Bankruptcy Code's {{provisions}} for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief are generally found in chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Sometimes chapter 7 bankruptcy {{is referred to}} as [...] "straight bankruptcy" [...] or [...] "liquidation bankruptcy", but these terms are basically a holdover from the past and are not helpful and are misleading. Basically, chapter 7 bankruptcy provides for the discharge of <b>dischargeable</b> debt, which does not include non-dischargeable debt, such as most student loans, alimony, child support, and some taxes. In most cases, filers under chapter 7 incur no liquidation of their property as all of their property is [...] "exempt." [...] Instances of the liquidation of property under chapter 7 is generally only found when the person wrongfully files under chapter 7 when they should have filed under chapter 13 or should not have filed for bankruptcy at all.|$|E
5000|$|Reaffirmations are {{strictly}} voluntary. If {{you wish to}} reaffirm (agree to pay back) any particular debt, you must enter into a written agreement with the creditor, which legally obligates you to pay all or {{a portion of a}} <b>dischargeable</b> (wiped out by the bankruptcy) debt. The form for this is Form 240A Reaffirmation Agreement. The creditor and debtor must fully complete the form indicating the nature of the debt, the value of the collateral, and the reason for reaffirmation. Both parties to the reaffirmation must sign on the appropriate signature lines. Since you are not represented by an attorney, the reaffirmation will be automatically set for hearing and you will receive written notice of the hearing date and time. You must appear at the hearing where the judge will determine if it is in your best interests to reaffirm, based on your circumstances {{and the nature of the}} reaffirmation. For example, the court may not allow you to reaffirm a debt of $3,000 for a vehicle that may be worth $1,000.|$|E
5000|$|By declaring England {{to be an}} [...] "empire" [...] {{this meant}} that England was a state entirely {{independent}} of [...] "the authority of any foreign potentates". Elton claimed that [...] "We call {{this sort of thing}} a sovereign national state". The Act outlawed appeals from courts within the realm to courts outside the realm. The English Reformation destroyed the jurisdiction of the Pope over England. England was now completely independent. For this reason Sir Thomas More went to his death, because in his words: [...] "This realm, being but one member and small part of the Church, might not make a particular law <b>dischargeable</b> with the general law of Christ's holy Catholic Church, no more than the City of London being but one poor member in respect of the whole realm, might make a law against an act of Parliament". He later said: [...] "I am not bounden...to conform my conscience to the Council of one realm against the General Council of Christendom. For of the foresaid holy bishops I have...above one hundred; and for one Council or Parliament...I have all the Councils made these thousand years. And for this one kingdom, I have all other Christian realms".|$|E

Yount reported that snow had fallen on 66 of 90 days between December 1880 and February 1881. He described the range and habits of Yellowstone's large mammals and expressed regret for [...] "the unfortunate breakage of my thermometer when {{it could not be}} replaced," [...] along with a submitted synopsis of the weather the previous winter. [...] In this report, he resigned his position [...] "to resume private enterprises now requiring my personal attention," [...] and concluded with a clear recommendation: I do not think that any one man appointed by the honorable Secretary, and specifically designated as a gamekeeper, is what is needed or can prove effective for certain necessary purposes, but a small and reliable police force of men, employed when needed, during good behavior, and <b>dischargeable</b> for cause by the superintendent of the park, is what is really the most practicable way of seeing that the game is protected from wanton slaughter, the forests from careless use of fire, and the enforcement of all the other laws, rules, and regulations for the protection and improvement of the park. There are indications that Yount had a difference of opinion with park superintendent Norris, who wanted him to spend more of his time building roads for the convenience of tourists, while Yount preferred to concentrate on protecting the wildlife.|$|E
40|$|Mental health {{policies}} on resettlement of the long-stay residents of psychiatric hospitals are presenting both the clients and staff of such hospitals with major transitions. In this article, we explore {{their reactions to}} these transitions from a personal construct theory perspective by considering the possible effects of hospitalization on a client's construct system, the anxiety with which the client may be confronted {{by the prospect of}} discharge, and the threat posed to some staff members by the community care policy. Research findings presented include evidence that clients are more likely to feel <b>dischargeable,</b> and to be considered <b>dischargeable</b> by staff, if their constructs applicable to people outside the psychiatric hospital are relatively highly organized. Evidence is also presented that staff who oppose the community care policy differentiate less between <b>dischargeable</b> and nondischargeable clients, and between nondis-chargeable clients and themselves, than do staff who favor the policy. Implications for the methodology of the study of psychiatric inpatients' views are discussed.

It was shown that an internal recirculation of UF retentate increases <b>dischargeable</b> water yield from 36 to 54 %. Solid/liquid separation by screw press separator and decanter centrifuge in combination with polymeric flocculants provided a reliable pre-treatment for the following ultrafiltration unit. The solids from the combined solid/liquid separation were characterised by high total solid concentrations (19 – 21 %), but also by concentrations of 4.7 – 6.1  kg t− 1 phosphorus and 6.0 – 9.7  kg t− 1 total nitrogen. Thus, the solids represent a high value organic N/P-fertiliser for local-field applications.|$|E
