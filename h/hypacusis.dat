50|$|Migraine with {{brainstem}} aura (abbreviated MBA) (previously used terms: basilar artery migraine; basilar migraine; basilar-type migraine) is a subtype of migraine with aura {{in which}} symptoms clearly originate from the brainstem, but no motor weakness. When motor symptoms are present, the subtype is coded as 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine. Originally the terms basilar artery migraine or basilar migraine were used but, since {{involvement of the}} basilar artery is unlikely, the term migraine with brainstem aura is preferred in ICHD-3 beta. There are typical aura symptoms {{in addition to the}} brainstem symptoms during most attacks. Many patients who have attacks with brainstem aura also report other attacks with typical aura and should be coded for both 1.2.1 Migraine with typical aura and 1.2.2 Migraine with brainstem aura. Many of the symptoms like dysarthria, vertigo, tinnitus, <b>hypacusis,</b> diplopia, ataxia and decreased level of consciousness may occur with anxiety and hyperventilation, and therefore are subject to misinterpretation. Serious episodes of migraine with brainstem aura can lead to stroke, coma, and death. Using triptans and other vasoconstrictors as abortive treatments for migraine with brainstem aura is contraindicated. Abortive treatments for migraine with brainstem aura address vasodilation and restoration of normal blood flow to the vertebrobasilar territory to restore normal brainstem function.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Ludwig van Beethoven, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} composers in History, was tormented for his whole life by a progressive deafness without definitive diagnosis. Many authors published studies about the etiologic possibilities of the deafness of the music genius with different explanations about his auditory loss. In this work, the author discusses the implications of Beethoven's progressive deafness to the creation of his word, as well as etiologic assumptions of his disease. Would Beethoven have had the same ingeniousness he showed in his symphonies if he did not have <b>hypacusis</b> and tinnitus? What is the influence of his deafness on his work and life? Could he have had a more precise diagnosis and specially a treatment nowadays? Would we have the brilliant composer if he had deafness today? We surely could not have...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{treatment}} of otosclerosis is eminently surgical. Good immediate {{results have been}} well documented when stapedotomy or stapedectomy are chosen. Objectives: This study aims to assess long term audiometric performance after otosclerosis surgery. Materials and Methods: this retrospective study enrolled stapedotomy and partial stapedectomy patients seen at our service with proven hearing improvement after surgery. Forty-one patients (47 ears) accepted the invitation to be reassessed. Audiometry results before and immediately after surgery were compared. Results: the median late follow-up was 11 years. To this date, 49 % of the patients had normal hearing or mild dysacusis. Preoperative, postoperative, and late postoperative bone and air pure tone averages were 64. 4 and 27. 0 dB, 35. 6 and 22. 3 dB, and 44. 1 and 29. 5 dB respectively. Conclusion: Otosclerosis surgery offers good long term results. Despite the worsening of thresholds, the level of <b>hypacusis</b> ten years after surgery {{is lower than the}} levels observed before surgery...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The cholesteatoma of the {{external}} acoustic meatus is an uncommon pathology. Most series in the literature describe secondary cases, with a few reports of primary cholesteatoma. It {{is characterized by the}} erosion of {{the external}} acoustic meatus bone portion by proliferation of the adjacent squamous tissue. Objective: To report an uncommon case of primary cholesteatoma of the bilateral external acoustic meatus. Case Report:Female patients aged 20 years old with ear ache for 3 years, associated to <b>hypacusis</b> and otorrhea to the left. Without a previous history of otologic pathologies. Upon otoscopy, there could be noticed bilateral erosion from the external acoustic meatus with a large amount of epidermal debris. The computed tomography confirmed cholesteatoma of the bilateral external acoustic meatus and the patient was submitted to modified radical tympanomastoidectomy to the right. Final Comments: The primary cholesteatoma {{of the external}} acoustic meatus is an uncommon pathology {{that is part of the}} differential diagnosis of chronic otalgia and otorrhea.

40|$|Introduction: Lesions of {{the jugular}} foramen are uncommon, and the paragangliomas {{are the most}} common tumors in this region, {{followed}} by schwannomas. Schwannomas are benign tumors, of slow growth and origin mainly in the sensitive cranial nerves. When located in the jugular foramen, the patients present with clinically auditory hearing loss, ataxia and headache, and cranial nerves IX, X and XI alterations are also common. Surgical excision is the therapeutic choice. Case Report: We reported the case of a young adult patient who sought the Otorhinolaryngology service at the School Hospital of Brasília for investigation of otalgia and chronic infection in the left ear, associated with tinnitus, <b>hypacusis</b> and tumor in the external ear canal. Initial diagnostic investigation by computed tomography and biopsy was inconclusive. New biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging were performed and definitive diagnosis of jugular foramen schwannoma was given. The lesion was then defined as type D by the classification of Kaye-Pellet, for it involved the jugular foramen, presented format of dumbbell and intra and extracranial components. The patient underwent a craniotomy and partial excision of the tumor. He did not have sequels of the procedure, although the otologic symptoms persisted. Final Comments: This case {{is an example of a}} rare disease. No more than two hundred cases have been reported in the literature and the clinical presentation is uncommon. The diagnostic and therapeutic challenge is faced by Otorhinolaryngology and Neurosurgery teams who are scheduling a new combined surgical procedure for a complete excision of the tumor...|$|E
40|$|The clinical, neuroradiological, neuropathological and {{biochemical}} {{findings in}} a patient with optico-cochleo-dentate degeneration (OCDD; OMIM 258700) are presented in a severe case succumbing {{at the age of}} 4 years. The electron microscopic and biochemical data showed {{for the first time that}} OCDD may occur as the phenotypic expression of D-bifunctional protein deficiency, i. e., a peroxisomal disorder. The boy was born as the first child of healthy, consanguineous parents of Turkish origin. No other family members were affected. The main clinical symptoms consisted of muscle hypotonia ("floppy infant"), generalized epileptic fits, <b>hypacusis,</b> rotatory nystagmus, insufficient pupillary reactions, and mental retardation. Fibroblast cultures revealed D-bifunctional protein deficiency. Neuropathological examination displayed moderate frontoparietal and insular microgyria, and atrophy of the cerebellum. Loss of neurons was severe in the granular layer, the Purkinje cell band of the cerebellum, and rather complete in the dentate nucleus. A corresponding loss of myelinated fibers associated with characteristic periodic acid-Schiff-positive macrophages was most prominent in the white matter of the cerebellum. There was additional severe loss of myelinated fibers in the central portions of the optic nerve, reduction of the nerve fiber density in the cochlear nerve, and reduction of myelinated nerve fibers by about 80 - 90 % in the sural nerve, which has not been studied in previous cases. At the electron microscopic level, characteristic inclusions mainly in perivascular macrophages and astrocytes were the most prominent finding. The inclusions usually showed a bilaminar structure, whereas trilaminar structures, typically seen in adrenoleukodystrophy, and multilaminar structures were less frequently see...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{occurrence}} of foreign bodies in otorhinolaryngology {{is a cause}} of frequent consultations in the urgency service. Objective: The objective of this work is to describe a number of patients with foreign bodies, {{as well as to}} evaluate the clinical picture and the treatment of these cases. Method: We carried out a prospective study of 128 patients with diagnosis of nose, ear and oropharynx foreign body, attended in the emergency room of the Hospital Paulista de Otorrinolaringologia, São Paulo, in the period from August 2005 through august 2007. Results: They were 67. 18 % of cases of foreign body in the ear; 18. 75 % cases in the nasal cavity and 14. 07 % in the oropharynx. Out of these patients 55. 47 % were men and 44. 53 % were women. The mean age was of 17 years. The evolution time average was of 12. 2 days, and 57. 03 % of the cases were attended with less than 24 hours of evolution. From the total of patients, 64. 85 % received initial service in the Emergency Room of the Hospital and 35. 15 % had been sent from another service after some previous removal attempt. The most common symptom of the cases of foreign body in the oropharynx was odinophagia, which was present in 88. 88 % of the cases; of foreign body in the nose, unilateral rhinorrhea, present in 37. 5 % of the cases and cacosmia in 25 % of the cases; and in the foreign body in the ear, 39. 53 % evolved with <b>hypacusis.</b> Conclusion: Most of the cases with prior manipulation for removal of the foreign bodies by non-skilled professional or laymen evolved with complications...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Multiple {{studies have}} proved that {{microvascular}} decompression (MVD) is {{the treatment of}} choice in cases of medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In the elderly, however, the surgical risks related to MVD {{are assumed to be}} unacceptably high and various alternative therapies have been proposed. We evaluated the outcomes of MVD in patients aged older than 65 years of age and compared them with the outcomes in a matched group of younger patients. The focus was on procedure-related morbidity rate and long-term outcome. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 112 patients with TN operated on consecutively over 22 years. The main outcome measures were immediate and long-term postoperative pain relief and neurological status, especially function of trigeminal, facial, and cochlear nerves, as well as surgical complications. A questionnaire was used to assess long-term outcome: pain relief, duration of a pain-free period, need for pain medications, time to recurrence, pain severity, and need for additional treatment. RESULTS: The mean age was 70. 35 years. The second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve were most frequently affected (37. 3 %). The mean follow-up period was 90 months (range, 48 - 295 months). Seventy-five percent of the patients were completely pain free, 11 % were never pain free, and 14 % experienced recurrences. No statistically significant differences existed in the outcome between the younger and older patient groups. Postoperative morbidity included trigeminal hypesthesia in 6. 25 %, <b>hypacusis</b> in 5. 4 %, and complete hearing loss, vertigo, and partial facial nerve palsy in 0. 89 % each. Cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis occurred in 1 patient each. There were no mortalities in both groups. CONCLUSION: MVD for TN is a safe procedure even in the elderly. The risk of serious morbidity or mortality is similar to that in younger patients. Furthermore, no significant differences in short- and long-term outcome were found. Thus, MVD is the treatment of choice in patients with medically refractory TN, unless their general condition prohibits it...|$|E

OBJETIVOS: Avaliar os resultados audiométricos da cirurgia da otosclerose a longo prazo. Desenho: Estudo retrospectivo. MATERIAL E MÉTODOS: Incluíram-se os doentes submetidos à estapedotomia/estapedectomia parcial no nosso Serviço e melhoria da audição pós-operatória comprovada. Convocaram-se os doentes para reavaliação audiométrica e compareceram 41 (47 ouvidos). Compararam-se os valores obtidos com os prévios à cirurgia e do pós-operatório imediato. RESULTADOS: A mediana do seguimento tardio foi de 11 anos. Nesta data, 49 % dos doentes tinham audição normal ou um grau de hipoacusia ligeira. Os valores médios dos PTA (Pure Tone Average) aéreo e ósseo, pré, pós e pós-operatório tardio foram 64, 4 e 27, 0 dB, 35, 6 e 22, 3 dB e 44, 1 e 29, 5 dB, respectivamente. CONCLUSÃO: A cirurgia da otosclerose tem bons resultados a longo prazo porque, apesar do agravamento dos limiares, o grau de hipoacusia, 10 anos depois, é inferior ao pré-operatório.

40|$|Abstract Hereditary sensory {{neuropathy}} type I (HSN I) is a slowly progressive {{neurological disorder}} characterised by prominent predominantly distal sensory loss, autonomic disturbances, autosomal dominant inheritance, and juvenile or adulthood disease onset. The exact prevalence is unknown, but is estimated as very low. Disease onset varies between the 2 nd and 5 th decade of life. The main clinical feature of HSN I is {{the reduction of}} sensation sense mainly distributed to the distal parts of {{the upper and lower}} limbs. Variable distal muscle weakness and wasting, and chronic skin ulcers are characteristic. Autonomic features (usually sweating disturbances) are invariably observed. Serious and common complications are spontaneous fractures, osteomyelitis and necrosis, as well as neuropathic arthropathy which may even necessitate amputations. Some patients suffer from severe pain attacks. <b>Hypacusis</b> or deafness, or cough and gastrooesophageal reflux have been observed in rare cases. HSN I is a genetically heterogenous condition with three loci and mutations in two genes (SPTLC 1 and RAB 7) identified so far. Diagnosis is based on the clinical observation and is supported by a family history. Nerve conduction studies confirm a sensory and motor neuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Radiological studies, including magnetic resonance imaging, are useful when bone infections or necrosis are suspected. Definitive diagnosis is based on the detection of mutations by direct sequencing of the SPTLC 1 and RAB 7 genes. Correct clinical assessment and genetic confirmation of the diagnosis are important for appropriate genetic counselling and prognosis. Differential diagnosis includes the other hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), especially HSAN II, as well as diabetic foot syndrome, alcoholic neuropathy, neuropathies caused by other neurotoxins/drugs, immune mediated neuropathy, amyloidosis, spinal cord diseases, tabes dorsalis, lepra neuropathy, or decaying skin tumours like amelanotic melanoma. Management of HSN I follows the guidelines given for diabetic foot care (removal of pressure to the ulcer and eradication of infection, followed by the use of specific protective footwear) and starts with early and accurate counselling of patients about risk factors for developing foot ulcerations. The disorder is slowly progressive and does not influence life expectancy but is often severely disabling after a long duration of the disease. </p...|$|E
