500|$|Headley is {{regarded}} by critics {{as one of}} the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley described Headley as [...] "the yardstick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are measured". In 1988, The Cricketer magazine placed him in an all-time West Indian team, as did a panel of judges for another such team in July 2010, while in 2004, another panel of experts named him among the top five West Indian players. He was given the nicknames [...] "the Black Bradman" [...] and [...] "Atlas" [...] by commentators, and was the first world-class batsman from the West Indies who was black. According to historian Gideon Haigh, his role was made harder by the weakness of his colleagues, as few outstanding players <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> play in teams which lose frequently. Although he was a naturally attacking player, Headley felt the need to play cautiously owing to the way his team depended on him. C. L. R. James believed that no other great batsman had to carry such a burden for so long. In the years before the war, Headley scored 25.61% of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies, more than twice as many as the next best batsman, and two-thirds of the team's centuries, scoring ten of the team's first fourteen centuries in Test cricket. Headley usually batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were often dismissed quickly, he frequently began his innings early.|$|E
500|$|The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, Spain {{stood in}} for the Tower of Joy in the {{flashback}} scene involving a young Ned Stark and Ser Arthur Dayne, as witnessed by Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven. During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You hope it is. Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but it takes a lot of skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

He said of Sutcliffe: [...] "You do learn a lot from watching a player of Herbert's class. [...] It was an enriching and invaluable experience to bat with him". [...] Sutcliffe's view of Hutton was that he was [...] "a marvel – the discovery of a generation". [...] Hutton said that his shyness {{and the fact that he}} was twenty years younger than Sutcliffe made it difficult for him to approach his partner when he needed help, which he more readily got from Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity.

With the death of Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright in September 2008, another reunion of the core group members became impossible. After Wright's death, his surviving former bandmates praised him for his influence on the sound of Pink Floyd. Gilmour said of Wright: [...] "In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound. Like Rick, I don't <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> express my feelings in words, but I loved him and will miss him enormously. I have never played with anyone quite like him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness {{may not be}} what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we ought to know when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E

Already {{by the end}} of January, he was writing his brother Theo that he did not always <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get along with Mauve. Shortly after this, they fell out with each other over an issue involving drawing from plaster casts, which Mauve was anxious van Gogh should undertake to perfect his technique. Van Gogh, however, vehemently insisted on drawing from models, and in a fit of pique destroyed some plaster casts of hands and feet that Mauve had given him to make studies from. Following that incident, Mauve said he would have nothing more to do with him for the next two months (i.e., {{for the rest of the}} winter). In reality, Mauve had resolved to break with Van Gogh completely. Van Gogh initially blamed Tersteeg for Mauve's indifference, but a chance meeting with Mauve in May made it clear to him that Mauve had definitively broken with him. He described the meeting in a letter to Theo, and in the same letter he revealed his {{relationship with}} Sien for the first time and passionately defended it: ...|$|E

[...] Discussing this comparison, Rachel McGrath of The Huffington Post UK said, [...] "He makes the murderous, abusive, rapist Archie look like a child's cuddly toy. We're genuinely terrified." [...] Vicky Prior from the Metro called Treadwell-Collins' claim [...] "bold [...] for a show that has produced some of TV's most iconic villains", and included in her list Nick Cotton (John Altman), Archie (Larry Lamb), Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), Phil Mitchell, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), Ronnie Mitchell, Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) and Babe Smith (Annette Badland), saying that [...] "I don't think Gavin will <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> earn a place in Walford's Rogues Gallery.

Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common.

When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and you say in your heart: ‘My strength and the power of my hand has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E
