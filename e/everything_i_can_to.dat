De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this.

[...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time".

5000|$|Derry City Council was {{responsible}} for setting up the Orchard Gallery on Orchard Street {{in the city of}} Derry and advertised for a curator in the late seventies. McGonagle was appointed to the post in 1978 and remained there until 1984. He gave up painting a year after he joined the Orchard. [...] "Though not purpose-built, the gallery was the first physical space in the city to be professionally devoted to the arts. The Orchard established itself on a minimal budget, and McGonagle found that international artists were attracted by the concept of addressing the issues of communities in conflict. In his first prominent role as a curator, McGonagle saw the gallery as “a facilitator for things to happen”. Here, he advocated community involvement and brought in challenging international exhibitions. People came to the Orchard for seminars, book fairs, punk rock sessions, performing arts, audio art, and photographic exhibitions. In {{the early days of the}} gallery, Feargal Sharkey and The Undertones played there regularly. Notable exhibitions during McGonagle’s tenure include Richard Long, Les Levine, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Derry Guildhall, Colin Harrison, Derek Hill, Felim Egan, and Robert Ballagh.
