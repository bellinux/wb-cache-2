5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of lettuce}} {{over the centuries}} has resulted in several changes through selective breeding: delayed bolting, larger seeds, larger leaves and heads, better taste and texture, a lower latex content, and different leaf shapes and colors. Work in these areas continues through the present day. Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing, with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance,</b> greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns.

40|$|O desenvolvimento de técnicas de DNA recombinante possibilitou a produção de plantas transgênicas através da transferência de genes de bactérias, vírus ou animais para as espécies vegetais. Como resultado desta tecnologia, já estão disponíveis ao melhoramento de plantas novas fontes de genes e plantas com resistência a doenças e insetos, tolerância a herbicidas e estresses ambientais e com qualidade superior. O objetivo desta revisão é apontar riscos, benefícios e aspectos importantes no uso de plantas transgênicas na agricultura. Entre as questões que vêm sendo discutidas a respeito de testes a campo de plantas transgênicas, pode-se destacar a segurança dos genes marcadores (especialmente os que conferem resistência a antibióticos ou tolerância a herbicidas) e o fluxo gênico entre espécies vegetais. Apesar dos Estados Unidos da América e a Comunidade Européia possuírem legislações para regulamentar os testes a campo e a liberação de plantas transgênicas em escala comercial, não existe uma legislação internacional que regulamente o uso desses produtos em outras partes do mundo. O impacto da tecnologia do DNA recombinante na produção de novos produtos agrícolas dependerá do entendimento pela sociedade dos riscos e benefícios que essa tecnologia poderá trazer para a agricultura. The {{development}} of recombinant DNA techniques has enabled gene transfer between plants and bacteria, virus or animais to produce transgenic plants. As {{a result of}} this technology, there are new genes and plants available to plant breeding for disease and insect resistance, herbicide and environmental stresses tolerance, and for superior quality products. The objectives of this review are topoint out the risks, benefits and importam aspects in using transgenic plants in agriculture. Among the important issues that have been discussed about field tests with transgenic plants, two have received more attention: the safety of marker genes (specially those that confer resistance to antibiotics or <b>herbicides</b> <b>tolerance)</b> and the gene flow between cultivated and wild plant species. Even though the United States of América and the European Community have strict ruies which regulate the field tests and the commercial release of transgenic plants, there are no international laws to regulate the se issues {{in other parts of the}} world. The impact of the recombinant DNA technology on the production of new agricultural products will depend on the understanding of their risks and benefits by the society...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{herbicide}} RoundUp ® became {{widely used}} in agriculture in the mid- 1990 s. Current populations of the crop weed Ipomoea purpurea exhibit both resistance and tolerance to RoundUp, which {{are two types of}} defence that have previously been shown to have a genetic basis in this weed species. Questions: Did the genetic basis of RoundUp defence antedate the introduction of RoundUp? If so, how does defence today compare with defence then? Organism: A preserved collection of Ipomoea purpurea seeds (the common morning glory) was germinated from 10 accessions sampled from the early 1980 s. A contemporary population of I. purpurea derived from a crossing scheme was used for comparison. Methods: Replicate seeds from both the historical and contemporary populations were planted into a field experiment located at the University of Georgia’s Plant Sciences Farm. Individuals were sprayed with the field rate of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the <b>herbicide</b> RoundUp. <b>Tolerance,</b> or the fitness response following herbicide application, and resistance, a measure of the amount of damage a plant exhibits after herbicide application, were determined for each line of both the historical and contemporary populations. Results: Genetic variation for both types of defence was already present in this weed species prior to the herbicide’s introduction in the mid- 1990 s. Furthermore, the level of tolerance to glyphosate has not increased over time. In contrast, our results suggest that resistance is higher in the contemporary population than in the historical accessions...|$|R
40|$|Cotton plants {{engineered}} {{for resistance}} to the herbicides, glyphosate or glufosinate have made a considerable impact on {{the production of the}} crop worldwide. In this work, embryogenic cell cultures derived from Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Coker 312 hypocotyl callus were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the rice cytochrome P 450 gene, CYP 81 A 6 (bel). In rice, bel has been shown to confer resistance to both bentazon and sulfanylurea herbicides. Transformed cells were selected on a liquid medium supplemented alternately or simultaneously with kanamycin (50 mg/L) and bentazon (4. 2 µmol). A total of 17 transgenic cotton lines were recovered, based on the initial resistance to bentazon and on PCR detection of the bel transgene. Bel integration into the cotton genome was confirmed by Southern blot and expression of the transgene was verified by RT-PCR. In greenhouse and experimental plot trials, <b>herbicide</b> (bentazon) <b>tolerance</b> of up to 1250 mg/L was demonstrated in the transgenic plants. Transgenic lines with a single copy of the bel gene showed normal Mendelian inheritance of the characteristic. Importantly, resistance to bentazon was shown to be stably incorporated in the T 1, T 2 and T 3 generations of self-fertilised descendents and in plants outcrossed to another upland cotton cultivar. Engineering resistance to bentazon in cotton through the heterologous expression of bel opens the possibility of incorporating this trait into elite cultivars, a strategy that would give growers a more flexible alternative to weed management in cotton crops...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 5 -Enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate (EPSP) synthase (AroA) is a {{key enzyme}} in the {{aromatic}} amino acid biosynthetic pathway in microorganisms and plants, and is {{the target of the}} <b>herbicide</b> glyphosate. Glyphosate <b>tolerance</b> activity of the enzyme could be obtained by natural occurrence or by site-directed mutagenesis. A functional Pseudomonas putida AroA was obtained by co-expression of two protein fragments AroAP. putida-N 210 and AroAP. putida-C 212 in Escherichia coli aroA mutant strain AB 2829. From sequence analysis, the equivalent split site on E. coli AroA was chosen for further study. The result indicated that functional E. coli AroA could also be reconstituted from two protein fragments AroAE. coli-N 218 and AroAE. coli-C 219, under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. This result suggested that the fragment complementation property of this family of enzyme may be general. Additional experiments indicated that the glyphosate tolerance property of AroA could also be reconstituted in parallel with its enzyme activity. The implication of this finding is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lengths of {{seedlings}} aboveground {{parts of}} nine wheat varieties grown in greenhouse were reduced by 4 - 20 %. They were tested during April at around 20 oC after twice daily treatments with glyphosate based herbicide (0. 5 ml in 1 l water solution, 0. 5 dl on 0. 5 m 2). When results of permanent artificially and daily lighted trials were compared, four groups of varieties were recognized same as was when near isogenic lines containing different leaf rust resistance genes (Lr NILs) were focused in winter. Growth of variety Pobeda decreased more when seedlings were not permanent lighted which confirmed the common <b>herbicide</b> effect. <b>Tolerance</b> of other varieties was again explained by enzymatic degradation of glyphosate and chlorophyll inhibition by consequential phosphorus acids. Varieties Simonida, Tavita and Rapsodia were similar by reaction to glyphosate as Lr 1 and Lr 21 NILs.

Field studies were conducted at two Texas locations during 2008 and 2009 to evaluate postemergence <b>herbicides</b> for castor <b>tolerance</b> and weed control efficacy. Clethodim and fluazifop-P-butyl caused no castor stunting while acifluorfen, bentazon, imazethapyr, and lactofen caused stunting which ranged from 5 to 46 %. Imazapic and 2, 4 -DB caused the greatest stunting (44 to 99 %) and resulted in castor yields of 0 to 45 % of the untreated check. Acifluorfen, imazapic, imazethapyr, lactofen, and 2, 4 -DB controlled at least 80 % smellmelon (Cucumis melo L. var.

A cDNA encoding the maize GST subunit GST- 27, under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, was introduced into explants of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines cv. Florida and L 88 - 31 via particle bombardment, using the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (pat) gene as a selectable marker. All six independent transgenic wheat lines recovered expressed the GST- 27 gene.

40|$|Herbicides are {{a common}} tool in weed control. With the {{introduction}} of genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops, {{there has been a}} dramatic increase in the use of particular herbicides. Herbicides contaminate the environment and food and feed and can come into contact with non-target organisms, especially bacteria. Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium, which is a human and animal pathogen, was chosen to investigate if the commercial formulations of three herbicides – Kamba, 2, 4 -D and Roundup are toxic to bacteria and whether sub-lethal concentrations cause a response to antibiotics. In addition, earlier work demonstrating an effect of salicylic acid on antibiotic response was reconfirmed in this study. The herbicides were toxic to S. typhimurium at concentrations above the manufacturers recommended application rates. A key finding of this study was that when S. typhimurium was grown in sub-lethal concentrations of the herbicides, it demonstrated a change in its susceptibility to various antibiotics. Kamba and 2, 4 -D caused increased tolerance of chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin and increased sensitivity to kanamycin. Exposure to Roundup caused increased sensitivity to chloramphenicol and tetracycline and increased tolerance towards kanamycin and ciprofloxacin. Roundup had no measureable affect on ampicillin susceptibility. The minimum concentrations of herbicides that induced an antibiotic response were within the recommended application rates. Furthermore, the minimum 2, 4 -D concentration that induced tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ampicillin tolerance was at or below the maximum residue limits set for food and feed commodities. Simultaneous exposure to an herbicide and an antibiotic was necessary for the induction of antibiotic tolerance. In addition, the effect of the herbicide on the antibiotic response was faster than the lethal effect of the antibiotics. Kamba induced chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin tolerance was maintained in the absence of Kamba once tolerance was induced by simultaneous exposure to Kamba and antibiotic. The emergence of antibiotic tolerance is an important health issue that may compromise treatment of serious bacterial infections. The widespread use of herbicides in agricultural, urban and domestic settings increases the number of bacteria that are exposed to <b>herbicides.</b> The <b>tolerance</b> induced by the herbicides may increase the frequency of antibiotic tolerant strains, increase the chance of co-exposure to antibiotics, and increase the potential for failure to treat bacterial infections as a result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biotechnology {{offers a}} variety of {{potential}} benefits and risks. It has enhanced food production by making plants less vulnerable to drought, frost, insects, and viruses and by enabling plants to compete more effectively against weeds for soil nutrients. In a few cases, it has also improved the quality and nutrition of foods by altering their composition. However, the use of biotechnology has also raised concerns about its potential risks to the environment and people. For example, some people fear that common plant pests could develop resistance to the introduced pesticides in GM crops that were supposed to combat them. Genetic engineering provides a means to introduce genes into plants via mechanisms that are different in some respects from classical breeding.

Within this genus, B. oleracea {{includes many}} major vegetable crops, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprout, kohlrabi, kale and cabbage. The key {{objective of this}} work was to develop an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system for broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) and related crops to facilitate crop improvement through genetic engineering. Five broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica) cultivars and one breeding line were evaluated for in vitro shoot regeneration. Hypocotyl and cotyledonary petiole explants taken from five-day-old seedlings were plated on media consisting of MS salts with B 5 vitamins (MSBS) and conditions for obtaining direct shoot regeneration from explants were optimized by testing a range of growth regulator combinations. The optimal growth regulator combination varied with cultivar. The highest percentage of shoot formation (100 %) and greatest average number of shoots per explant (28 for hypocotyls and 12 for cotyledonary petioles) were observed with the cultivar 'Cruiser'. Shoots rooted with up to 100 % frequency after four weeks of culture on growth regulator free MSBS medium. Shoot regeneration consistently occurred {{after two weeks of}} culture and plants with roots were obtained within six weeks. Using the optimal shoot regeneration condition, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methodology was developed. Cotyledonary petiole explants from the cultivars 'Cruiser' and 'Green Valiant' were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying a plasmid coding for &# 946;-glucuronidase (GUS), neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) and phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (PAT) which confers <b>herbicide</b> (phosphinothricin) <b>tolerance</b> under the independent regulation of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter. Plants resistant to 20 mg/L kanamycin were regenerated at a frequency of 1 - 10 % from cotyledonary petiole explants and were shown to be transformed by GUS staining, NPTII and PAT assays, PCR analysis, Southern blotting and genetic segregation analysis. An efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method was developed, with significant modifications subsequently made, to facilitate handling of large numbers of explants {{in a short period of}} time. Transformation of other B. oleracea varieties such as cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, cabbage and Brussels sprout was also achieved with this method.

The published article is copyrighted by the author(s) and published by BioMed Central Ltd. The published article can be found at: [URL] Herbicide resistance in weedy plant populations can develop through different mechanisms such as gene flow of herbicide resistance transgenes from crop species into compatible weedy species or by natural evolution of <b>herbicide</b> resistance or <b>tolerance</b> following selection pressure. Results from our previous studies suggest that sub-lethal levels of the herbicide glyphosate can alter the pattern of gene flow between glyphosate resistant Canola®, Brassica napus, and glyphosate sensitive varieties of B. napus and B. rapa. The objectives of this study were to examine the phenological and developmental changes that occur in Brassica crop and weed species following sub-lethal doses of the herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate. We examined several vegetative and reproductive traits of potted plants under greenhouse conditions, treated with sub-lethal herbicide sprays. RESULTS: Our results indicate that exposure of Brassica spp. to a sub-lethal dose of glyphosate results in altering flowering phenology and reproductive function. Flowering of all sensitive species was significantly delayed and reproductive function, specifically male fertility, was suppressed. Higher dosage levels typically contributed to an increase in the magnitude of phenotypic changes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Brassica spp. plants that are exposed to sub-lethal doses of glyphosate could be subject to very different pollination patterns and an altered pattern of gene flow that would result from changes in the overlap of flowering phenology between species. Implications include the potential for increased glyphosate resistance evolution and spread in weedy communities exposed to sub-lethal glyphosate...|$|R

50|$|Glutathione or its homologues, e.g. homoglutathione in Fabaceae; hydroxymethylglutathione in Poaceae are {{the major}} {{water-soluble}} non-protein thiol compounds present in plant tissue and account for 1-2% of the total sulfur. The content of glutathione in plant tissue ranges from 0.1 - 3 mM. Cysteine is the direct precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (and its homologues). First, γ-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from cysteine and glutamate catalyzed by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Second, glutathione is synthesized from γ-glutamylcysteine and glycine (in glutathione homologues, β-alanine or serine) catalyzed by glutathione synthetase. Both steps of the synthesis of glutathione are ATP dependent reactions. Glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by an NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) generally exceeds a value of 7.Glutathione fulfils various roles in plant functioning. In sulfur metabolism it functions as reductant in the reduction of APS to sulfite. It is also the major transport form of reduced sulfur in plants. Roots likely largely depend for their reduced sulfur supply on shoot/root transfer of glutathione via the phloem, since the reduction of sulfur occurs predominantly in the chloroplast. Glutathione is {{directly involved in the}} reduction and assimilation of selenite into selenocysteine. Furthermore, glutathione is of great significance in the protection of plants against oxidative and environmental stress and it depresses/scavenges the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species, e.g. superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides. Glutathione functions as reductant in the enzymatic detoxification of reactive oxygen species in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and as thiol buffer in the protection of proteins via direct reaction with reactive oxygen species or by the formation of mixed disulfides. The potential of glutathione as protectant is related to the pool size of glutathione, its redox state (GSH/GSSG ratio) and the activity of glutathione reductase. Glutathione is the precursor for the synthesis of phytochelatins, which are synthesized enzymatically by a constitutive phytochelatin synthase. The number of γ-glutamyl-cysteine residues in the phytochelatins may range from 2 - 5, sometimes up to 11. Despite the fact that the phytochelatins form complexes which a few heavy metals, viz. cadmium, it is assumed that these compounds play a role in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification by buffering of the cytoplasmatic concentration of essential heavy metals. Glutathione is also involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, compounds without direct nutritional value or significance in metabolism, which at too high levels may negatively affect plant functioning. Xenobiotics may be detoxified in conjugation reactions with glutathione catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase, which activity is constitutive; different xenobiotics may induce distinct isoforms of the enzyme. Glutathione S-transferases have great significance in herbicide detoxification and tolerance in agriculture and their induction by herbicide antidotes ('safeners') is the decisive step for the induction of <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> in many crop plants. Under natural conditions glutathione S-transferases are assumed to have significance in the detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides, in the conjugation of endogenous metabolites, hormones and DNA degradation products, and in the transport of flavonoids.|$|E
40|$|The study {{relates to}} a hybrid rice seed {{production}} method to efficiently incorporate new <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> into a systems using existing elite three-line hybrid rice parental lines, a WACMS female line, a maintainer line, and a restorer line. The method requires the following steps: (1) breeding for an isogenic maintainer line {{consisting of the}} trait of interest, herein <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> using the elite maintainer parent and a donor of the trait of interest; (2) breeding for an isogenic restorer line consisting the trait of interest, herein <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> using the elite restorer parent and a donor of the trait of interest; (3) introduction of the <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> trait into the female line at the last step of basic seed production by crossing the isogenic maintainer line with the elite female line to generate a hemizygous female line; (4) introduction of the <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> trait into the hybrid during the hybrid seed production by crossing the isogenic restorer line with the hemizygous female line.

40|$|The {{minimum tillage}} farming systems in Western Australia require cultivars with <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the {{effective}} weed control in crops. Thus, improving <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{is one of}} the breeding objectives of the narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) breeding program. We have successfully improved narrow-leafed lupin with tolerance to post-emergent metribuzin. Germplasm screening revealed that there were tolerant and susceptible commercial cultivars, advanced breeding lines and accessions in the germplasm collections. The differences between the tolerant and the very susceptible varieties to metribuzin at seedling stage were large. Tolerant plants showed no foliar damag...|$|E
