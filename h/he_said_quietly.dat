6000|$|Joe {{remained}} silent while {{one might have}} counted ten, trying to restrain his anger, and then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>quietly,</b> but firmly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{perfectly}} right, Bannister," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Everything {{you have}} said is quite true. And now would you mind going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Benjulia {{made his}} {{acknowledgments}} {{in his own}} remarkable way. [...] "No, thank you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I'd rather see the monkey." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Luke {{who broke}} the silence. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> quite <b>quietly</b> asking the {{question}} as if it related to a most trivial, most indifferent matter: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>quietly,</b> [...] "your {{arguments}} have prevailed, and {{it shall}} be as you desire. The ci-devant Vicomte d'Ombreval shall go free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now listen,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> more <b>quietly</b> and humanly, {{when she}} had become calmer: 'Springrove must marry the woman he's engaged to. You may make him, but only in one way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The Angel made an irresolute movement. [...] "Your {{eyes are}} very beautiful," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> with a remote wonder in his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am much {{obliged to}} you, Mr. Laverick," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "We shall, perhaps, resume this {{discussion}} at some future date." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Promotion." [...] Sterne silenced {{him with}} a sort of candid bravado. The engineer's round soft cheeks quivered still, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> enough-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as <b>quietly</b> as <b>he</b> could contrive, [...] "we {{will run}} the canoe down. I believe {{some of the things}} they get are {{infectious}} now and then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are by {{no means}} a {{stranger}} to me," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>quietly</b> handed her the photograph. [...] "This is your picture; I found it among the dead lad's things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wench has {{had three}} whole days wherein to alter her present mood," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more <b>quietly,</b> [...] "and you know yourself, citizen, that the proconsul will not wait after to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Maggie," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "they tell me {{that you}} are {{interested}} in the political side of my visit to this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{senior partner}} struck the gong which stood upon the table. [...] "Gilray," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "go out {{and bring in}} a policeman." ...|$|E
6000|$|A shadow {{suddenly}} {{crept into}} Valentine's brown face. [...] "Well," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "as it happens, I do {{know a little}} too much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{stay here}} till you rot," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> quite <b>quietly,</b> [...] "for I'll give you no burial. As for this Hugh, I would have spared him, {{but you have}} signed his death-warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Fyshe {{paused a}} moment and then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly,</b> [...] "We are quite sure," [...] and he {{exchanged}} a look with Mr. Boulder that meant volumes to those who would read it.|$|R
6000|$|Torrance {{struck the}} bell again, {{and waited until}} the maid came in. [...] "I {{understand}} Mr. Clavering promised to marry you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly.</b> [...] "You {{would be willing to}} take him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find your}} husband," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "rather an {{interesting}} type. We {{have no one}} like that in Germany. He almost puzzles me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I think it's {{better to}} sit tight and wait. When {{the time to}} act comes, you {{certainly}} will know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lenora," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "that {{was kind}} of a brutal note I told you to give to French, but I thought you'd understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{told me of}} uncle Pali's illness," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> more <b>quietly,</b> [...] "and how {{he seemed}} to have fretted about me lately [...] . . . and that {{everyone}} here thought that I was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Both dead," [...] Skipper said in {{a change}} of delirium. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> it <b>quietly,</b> as if announcing the time of day, then wailed: [...] "But, oh, the bonnie, bonnie braids of all the golden hair of her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means {{simply a}} pledge--no sentiment--the seal of a {{practical}} compact," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more <b>quietly,</b> but still retaining {{her hand in}} his firm grasp. [...] "Come, now!" [...] And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her critically. [...] "We will go together, side by side," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "but {{you will have to}} take the outside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Sahib," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{composing}} {{himself on}} a little mat with a respectful inclination of the body; [...] "I am Ram Das of Cawnpore." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I humbly {{beg your}} pardon," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "And must crave your kind indulgence for my mood: but I {{have been so}} anxious ..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to get further away from you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more <b>quietly.</b> [...] "There's no knowing what may happen if I don't. I don't want to kill you. At least, I do, but I had better not." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{passed his}} hand over his {{forehead}} with a sigh of relief. [...] "It's bad enough as it is," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> speaking <b>quietly</b> on his side. [...] "But the remedy for it is plain enough. Come back to the tent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{sleep in}} the other wing," [...] said Clayton. [...] "Yes. Well--" [...] He pulled at his cigar for some little time as though he still hesitated about his confidence. Then <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> quite <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I caught a ghost!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Captain Carg must be {{anchored}} at San Pedro, by now. Or {{perhaps he}} is at Long Beach, or Santa Monica," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} you are her mother," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "that I {{thought you might be}} glad to find a {{suitable}} home for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Bandar-log {{have shifted}} their grounds," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "When I came {{up into the}} sun today I heard them {{whooping}} among the tree-tops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{notions of}} God are heathen notions," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> more <b>quietly.</b> [...] "You {{confound}} Him with Jupiter the Thunderer. But He {{does not use}} His lightnings as did the father of Olympus. And yet--reflect! Consider {{the manner in which}} that brigand met his death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use, Hetty," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Chris {{would tell}} them nothing. There is no meanness in his father or him; but that wouldn't stop him thinking. Now, you will know I was right to-morrow. Take him back his pistol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From your {{attitude}}, M. le duc," [...] <b>he</b> then <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> hiding obvious sarcasm {{behind a}} veil of studied deference, [...] "from your attitude I gather that your wishes with regard to Mlle. de Kernogan have undergone no modification. You would still honour me by desiring that she should become my wife?" ...|$|R
