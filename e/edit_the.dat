5|$|George Wilkes (1817– September 23, 1885) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor. A native of New York, Wilkes became a {{journalist and}} after losing a libel case was imprisoned in New York City's jail; his imprisonment led him to write a pamphlet on the jail's conditions in 1844. The next year, Wilkes and a friend started publishing National Police Gazette, a newspaper dealing with crime reporting and other sensationalistic topics. In 1856 Wilkes bought a sporting newspaper called The Spirit of the Times, which he had previously worked for.

5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to <b>edit</b> <b>the</b> clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E
5|$|Information differs {{as to who}} {{replaced}} Larssen. According to Evald Solbakken, and also to the reference bibliography Norske aviser 1763–1969, the replacement was Olav Scheflo, who needed a stand-in, Ingvald B. Jacobsen, for the first period. According to the encyclopaedia Arbeidernes Leksikon and historian Einhart Lorenz, Trond Hegna was the editor in 1927, before he took over Norges Kommunistblad {{in the summer of}} 1927. Hegna's main job was to <b>edit</b> <b>the</b> periodical Mot Dag, but in this period the people of Mot Dag had an informal influence on the Communist Party and several of their newspapers. Scheflo formally edited the newspaper from 1927 to 1928, with Eivind Petershagen as acting editor from late 1927. In 1928 Petershagen formally took over, only to have Jørgen Vogt become acting editor later that year. Vogt took over in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent led the {{scientific}} expedition. Additionally, he made detailed botanical studies.

In Morea, Bory de Saint-Vincent was content to collect plants. He proceeded to classify, identify and describe them upon his return to France. Then he was aided, not by his collaborators from Greece, but by Louis Athanase Chaubard, Jean-Baptiste Fauché and Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart.

Attempts to complete and <b>edit</b> <b>the</b> opera were made by Ukrainian composer Mykhailo Verykivsky. Composer Myroslav Skoryk and poet Diodor Bobyr used the musical material of the unfinished opera to make a one act operetta; this premiered in 1977 at the Kiev State Opera and Ballet Theatre, one hundred years after Leontovych's birth. The North American premiere took place in Toronto on April11,2003.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed.

Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also contends that Sadler refused to include some material provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, contends that statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did not write, or extensively <b>edit,</b> <b>The</b> Urantia Book.|$|E
