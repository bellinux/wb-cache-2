40|$|Assessing {{the risk}} of banking crises 1 Over the last two decades, banking crises have become more {{frequent}} and severe in both emerging market and industrial countries. 2 Their cost in terms of output lost has been high, typically double digit percentages of GDP. For this reason, considerable efforts have been made recently to develop “early warning indicators ” of crises that could allow policymakers to take remedial action in a more timely fashion. This special feature proposes a set of <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators</b> of banking distress. As in Borio and Lowe (2002) we argue {{that it may be}} possible recognise the build-up of one set of vulnerabilities that foreshadows banking distress with a reasonable degree of confidence, although the exact timing of the crises remains unpredictable. The corresponding indicators draw exclusively on ex ante information, are based on the interaction among a small set of variables, focus on the cumulative processes giving rise to distress and allow for variable horizons. Here we extend our previous work, which had mainly considered credit aggregate and asset prices, by examining the information contained in real exchange rate appreciations and the relative performance of indicators in industrial and emerging market countries. In the first section of this article we briefly discuss the origins of banking crises. In the second we motivate the choice of indicators and assess their performance. In the concluding section we note some caveats to the analysis and suggest areas for future work. The origin of banking crises 3 Typical features of banking crises: Views about the origin of banking crises influence the strategy to be followed in developing <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators</b> of distress and judgments about their usefulness.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has clearly {{shown that the}} relationship between bank internationalization and risk is complex. Multinational banks can benefit from portfolio diversification, reducing their overall riskiness, but this effect can be offset by incentives going in the opposite direction, leading them to take on excessive risks. Since both effects are grounded on solid theoretical arguments, the answer of what is the actual relationship between bank internationalization and risk is left to the empirical analysis. In this paper, we study such relationship in the period leading to the {{financial crisis}} of 2007 - 2008. For a sample of 384 listed banks from 56 countries, we calculate two measures of risk for the period from 2001 to 2007 – the expected default frequency (EDF), a market-based and <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicator,</b> and the Z-score, a balance-sheet-based and backward-looking measure – and relate them to their degree of internationalization.

In this paper, we study various measures of leverage in the context of shadow banking, relying on a dynamic setting, which features Kalman filter procedures and different detrending methods. Applying this framework to Canadian data, we can detect the increase in risk associated to banks new business lines years before what the conventional risk measures predict. We also find that the elasticity measures of leverage, compared to the simple balance sheet ratios like the ratio of assets to equity or the mandatory leverage measure, are generally more <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators</b> of bank risk, and better capture the cyclical pattern of bank leverage.

Since World War II we have had eight recessions preceded by substantial problems in housing and consumer durables. Housing did not give an early warning of the Department of Defense Downturn after the Korean Armistice in 1953 or the Internet Comeuppance in 2001, nor should it have. By virtue of its prominence in our recessions, it makes sense for housing to play a prominent role in the conduct of monetary policy.

40|$|How can the {{informed}} citizen know if {{the government}} is implementing a good-enough climate change policy? Most developed democracies have their own set of indicators for sustainable development, including indicators for climate change. These include yearly national emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), global concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere and time series for global temperatures. However, without some kind of benchmark neither national emissions of GHGs nor global concentration of GHGs or temperatures, make it possible for the general public to evaluate the current climate policy of a nation state. In this paper we propose a benchmark for national climate policy based on a remaining CO 2 budget allocated by egalitarian principles. Moreover, based on Kantian ethics we argue that this benchmark should be used as a sustainable development indicator for climate change. One way of interpreting Kantian ethics is to demand that each nation state should act as if a just global treaty on climate change were in place. We discuss possible important elements in a global treaty, and show how the different elements can be integrated in a <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicator</b> of national climate policy...|$|E

40|$|For {{the second}} {{month in a}} row, the regular WIFO {{business}} survey is pointing to a recovery in the Austrian manufacturing sector. This is consistent with an upturn in leading indicators in the USA and the EU. Still, no relief is as yet in sight for the construction sector and the labour market. According to <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators,</b> a business cycle turnaround may be imminent. In the USA, the purchasing managers index jumped in February, while in Germany the ifo index for the business climate has been trending up {{for the last couple}} of months. For the euro area, the GDP indicator developed by a group of European economic research institutes (Euroframe) suggests rates of growth of 1. 4 and 2. 0 percent, respectively, for the first and the second quarter. The main drivers of the rebound are declines in interest rates and oil prices as well as improved expectations in the USA and in Europe. At this early stage, negative shocks may jeopardise a still fragile recovery. If, however, the positive expectations are confirmed, Europe has managed to avoid a recession. In Austria also, the economy has probably reached the trough of the cycle. Business sentiment has improved for the second consecutive month in February. In particular, expectations for the near future have turned more optimistic. Incoming orders, the business outlook and production expectations have been given better ratings by industrial firms than over the last months. In the construction sector, sentiment has stabilised in civil engineering, brought about partly by the stimulus programmes launched by the federal and the state governments. No upturn is yet visible for building activity, notably for new-home building. Data on exports and production only go as far as the end of last year. As could be expected, they show declines, thereby confirming earlier survey data. On the labour market, no turnaround is as yet discernible. The cyclical slowdown and the crisis in the construction industry have worsened the situation, leaving more negative marks on the jobless than on the employment data: while unemployment rose by 38, 700 year-on-year in February, employment went down by 7, 300 over the same period. The difference is explained by the sizeable increase in labour supply, due inter alia to a net inflow of foreign workers and the rise in the statutory early retirement age. Contrary to expectations held in some quarters, inflation has not been boosted by the introduction of euro notes and coins early this year. Abstracting from price increases for seasonal goods (fruits, vegetables), consumer prices edged down from December. Apparently, dual price advertising, price surveillance and competitive pressure have all had a positive effect in this regard. With inflation having gained momentum in other western European countries, the Austrian rate is now clearly below the average for the euro area.

This situation is caused by incorrect calculations of these indexes, or the excess of influence of mental factors compared with the economic laws for the process of investing capital in the trading business of Ukraine and entrepreneurship. The tendencies of stochastic dependence of the investment capital and of the obtained effects undoubtedly manifested in indicators of efficiency. There are some distortions in the understanding of the optimistic and pessimistic forecasts from the point of view of trends in the external environment and trading business in Ukraine. In particular, the pessimistic forecast of total capital return (0. 3 grn.) was better than the optimistic (0. 2 grn.), and the same with respect to the turnover on UAH 1 capital. This indicates a decrease of the total capital return of trading companies (more rapid growth of capital investment as compared to the effects obtained from them), with the progressive development of the external environment factors. The same is observed for the non-current assets returns, for fixed assets and current assets returns, and profitability of total capital, of non-current capital, of fixed assets, of current assets, and for the profit per one enterprise. Other trends of performance indicators consistent with the general trends in the development of Ukraine's economy. Thus, performance management of capital investments in the business at the operational stage of the investment cycle can be carried out by modeling the cause-effect relationships of the system performance indicators and system of exogenous factors, of indicators of capital investments and of the obtained effects. The model can be built on the system of lump-sum equations, which are calculated by the stochastic and functional links between the above indicators. The system performance indicators can be significantly expanded and built in the context of capital investors (stakeholders) and time horizons (short-, medium-and long-term). The number of indicators of capital investments and exogenous factors, too, can be greatly expanded. The system of equations can also include the functional relationship between the planned indicators. Performance management of capital investments in the business from the perspective of the object of capital investments allows to predict, to monitor, and to analyze of the performance indicators system (as opposed to one or more integrated indicators) over the full life cycle of the enterprise-object of capital investments. To some extent, <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators</b> of efficiency can be manipulated by changing the parameters of capital investments (dependend management indicators). The disadvantages of the approach are: 1) the proposed method of construction of the model can be applied only in the context of stable development of the economy, else stochastic communication parameters may not be set, 2) technique requires a large sample of statistical information, 3) it is sometimes difficult to establish the factors that actually have impact on the performance, that is, made calculations may not lead to the identification of mathematical functions...|$|R
40|$|Responses by {{firms in}} the regular WIFO {{business}} survey have signalled an upturn in Austrian industrial activity for almost half a year. In April and May, judgements on current business conditions have not improved further. Nevertheless, prospects {{for the next few}} months remain positive. The international recession has been overcome. An upturn is under way, although its strength is yet uncertain. In the USA, real GDP picked up markedly both in the fourth quarter 2001 and in the first quarter 2002, supported by a decidedly pro-active policy stance. In western Europe, early expectations were somewhat disappointed, as the EU economy stagnated in the first quarter. While last year's downturn in the EU was highly synchronised with that in the USA, the indications for a rebound this year are less clear. Still, all leading indicators point to a recovery. In Austria too, confidence in the business sector has been growing for months. In particular, production expectations and other <b>forward-looking</b> <b>indicators</b> are rated much more positive, although the overall sentiment has improved no further in April and May. According to provisional calculations, manufacturing output in the first quarter matched the year-earlier level, while construction activity fell sharply in the winter season. The steeper the cyclical downturn in a sector, the more marked is also the negative seasonal profile. In the first four months of the year, some 7, 000 jobs (– 3 ¼ percent) were lost in the construction sector from the previous year. Retail (excluding motor cars) and wholesale trade both edged up by ½ percent in volume in the first quarter, but the slump in car sales (– 5 percent in real terms) dragged the sector's value added down below the year-earlier level. Passenger car purchases react rather strongly to short-term variations in incomes and costs (oil prices). Even stronger, however, are cyclical fluctuations in business investment. The latter remained sluggish in the first quarter, leading to a nominal decline by 11 percent year-on-year in imports of machinery and transportation equipment in January and February combined. Tourism, on the other hand, continued its positive trend in the winter season, with earnings rising by 4 ½ percent at current prices. Inflation is abating gradually. In April, the rate edged down to 1. 8 percent, mainly due to an easing of prices for vegetables, price cuts for mobile telephones and of lower energy costs compared with last year. In an international comparison, Austria claims a high rank in terms of price stability: on the Harmonised Consumer Price Index, prices went up by 1. 6 percent, compared with 2. 4 on average for the euro area. While in some countries the changeover to euro cash money may have added to inflation, that has not been the case in Austria. As could be expected, no turnaround is as yet visible on the labour market. Official statistics give a total of 3, 155, 600 dependent employees for May, 5, 500 more than one year ago. However, this figure is less relevant for the cyclical analysis, as it includes non-working recipients of child-care benefits whose job contracts have not been terminated. The adjusted figure of jobholders (excluding child-care benefit receivers and people in military service) went down by 11, 600 year-on-year in May. The decline has been somewhat stronger than on average in the first four months of the year. Job losses in manufacturing (– 13, 000 in April) and construction led to an increase in unemployment benefit payments, whereas those in transportation (postal service, telecom, railways) and the public sector were accommodated mainly by transition into retirement.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} Earth Summit was {{launched}} at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, {{the concept of}} sustainability has exerted significant influence on policy at local level. Sustainable urban development has also become an important local strategy for global sustainability. Due to their integrative and <b>forward-looking</b> characteristics, sustainability <b>indicators</b> have been proposed to measure and evaluate urban development. After discussing the ecological economic dimension of urban sustainability, this paper presents a procedure and a conceptual framework of the indicator system for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. On the basis of natural processes and evolving urban development, the approach to Taipei's sustainable development is defined as reinforcing Taipei's metropolitan life-support system through its economic vitality for enhancing Taipei's urban productivity and quality and making Taipei a national capital with blue-green characteristics. Based on the conceptual framework of urban ecological economic system, 80 indicators are selected through participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), {{which can be used}} as policy-making indicators for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. The policy-making indicators are further aggregated into 10 general public indicators and evaluated using signal lights (green, yellow and red). It is concluded that the proposed indicator system can provide evidence of progress on urban sustainability. Justification of public expenditure on urban development can therefore be evaluated.
