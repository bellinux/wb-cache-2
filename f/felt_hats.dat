25|$|Hard <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> {{are made}} by {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. <b>Felt</b> <b>hats</b> with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide brimmed <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with very small brims, the present day fashion tending {{to do away with the}} brim altogether.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{dress of}} the Monpa {{is based on}} the Tibetan Chuba. Both men and women wear headwear made of yak hair, with long tassels. The women tend to wear a warm jacket and a sleeveless chemise that reaches down to the calves, tying the chemise round the waist with a long and narrow piece of cloth. Ornaments include those made of silver, corals and turquoise. One can see a person wearing a cap with a single peacock feather round their <b>felt</b> <b>hats.</b>|$|E
25|$|Felt hatting was {{recorded}} in Denton as early as 1702 and Denton gained supremacy in the hatting industry {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The increasing importance of Denton and Haughton as centres of felt hat production is demonstrated by the increase of manufacturers in the area: in 1800 there were 4 hatting firms in Denton and Haughton, but by 1825 there were 25 manufacturers, making it the third largest hat making centre in the north west. By 1840, 24,000 <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> were produced in Denton a week. The prosperity of the hatting industry is reflected in the growth of the town from 2,501 in 1801 to 6,759 in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1878, in {{collaboration}} with hatter Dwight Wheeler, House invented and patented a machine for blocking <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> in 28 seconds. The patents were issued on February 25, 1879 {{and in the same}} year the House and Wheeler Hat Flanging Co., a joint stock company, was formed in Bridgeport. A practical machine was built and installed at the Marrinet Hat Co. at Salisbury, Connecticut. The employees, adverse to any innovations that might reduce their value to the company, went on strike. The hat flanging machine fulfilled all requirements, and after the machine had been working a few months the strikers were ready to compromise. In later years the Hatters Union voted against its use entirely.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} {{artificial}} silk. They {{succeeded in making}} a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, <b>felt</b> <b>hats,</b> and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E
25|$|During the 1840s, {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E
500|$|From the mid-18th to {{the mid-19th}} centuries, {{a process called}} [...] "carroting" [...] {{was used in the}} making of <b>felt</b> <b>hats.</b> Animal skins were rinsed in an orange {{solution}} (the term [...] "carroting" [...] arose from this color) of the mercury compound mercuric nitrate, Hg(NO3)2·2H2O. This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. The United States Public Health Service banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning inspired the phrase [...] "mad as a hatter". Lewis Carroll's [...] "Mad Hatter" [...] in his book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was a play on words based on the older phrase, but the character himself does not exhibit symptoms of mercury poisoning.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{business model}} of the company was commercial hat production of harvest straw hats. [...] On the micro-economic level, St. Louis had become a center of hat manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution. [...] In 1900, 129 businesses in St. Louis were producing custom hats for women, with approximately 600 employees in the industry. [...] Within the decade, St. Louis was the fifth largest producer of fur <b>felt</b> <b>hats.</b> [...] International Harvest Hat proposed {{to do the same}} thing for straw harvest hats, by ramping up production capacity and challenging the manufacturing centers in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. [...] The timing of market entry was favorable to the company's goals, as the organization was established at the peak decade of the commercial hat apparel market. [...] In 1910, over 42 million hats were produced in the United States, an all-time record for domestic production.|$|E

2500|$|The phrase mad as a hatter {{is likely}} a {{reference}} to mercury poisoning among milliners (so-called [...] "mad hatter disease"), as mercury-based compounds were once used {{in the manufacture of}} <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> in the 18th and 19th century. (The Mad Hatter character of Alice in Wonderland was, it is presumed, inspired by an eccentric furniture dealer named Theophilus Carter. Carter was [...] not a victim of mad hatter disease although Lewis Carroll would have been familiar with the phenomenon of dementia that occurred among hatters.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fishermen}} traded metal {{items for}} beaver robes made of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. They used the robes {{to keep warm}} on the long, cold return voyages across the Atlantic. These castor gras in French (or [...] "beaver coat" [...] in English) became prized by European hat makers {{in the second half}} of the 16th century, as they converted the pelts to fur felt. The discovery of the superior felting qualities of beaver fur, along with the rapidly increasing popularity of beaver <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> in fashion, transformed the incidental trading of fishermen in the sixteenth century into a growing trade in the French and later English territories in the next century.|$|E

2500|$|The term harquebusier {{fell out}} of use gradually, as armour use {{declined}} and the 'fully armoured cuirassier' disappeared. Harquebusiers {{became part of the}} undifferentiated [...] "horse" [...] or, in French, [...] "cavalerie", of the early and mid 18th century. In the British army many cavalry regiments having their origins as units of harquebusiers eventually transformed into dragoons. In the last two decades of the 17th century use of armour and the buff coat declined and helmets were more definitively replaced by <b>felt</b> <b>hats,</b> and uniform coats were widely adopted. As an example, all items of armour previously employed by the regiment of Oxford Blues (precursor of the Royal Horse Guards) were ordered to be put in store in 1688 before the regiment went on active service.|$|E
2500|$|Companies of The Boys' Brigade used manuals on scout {{training}} in their programmes. In May 1903, Robert Baden-Powell became a vice-president. Baden-Powell promoted {{the idea of}} scouting and outdoor pursuits in the Boys' Brigade and other boys' organisations and schools. The Boys' Brigade formally began its boy scout scheme in 1906. Scout badges (Silver second class & Gold first class) were awarded in The Boys' Brigade and there were specialised Boys' Brigade Scout sections, which operated {{as part of a}} BB Company, but met at different times to train in scouting, who wore khaki or blue uniforms, neck scarves and the distinctive four dented broad brimmed fur <b>felt</b> <b>hats.</b> Boys of the Bournemouth & Poole Battalion of The Boys' Brigade participated in Baden-Powell's experimental camp on Brownsea Island in 1907. Baden-Powell did not originally intend to start a separate organisation.|$|E
2500|$|The kepi {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the model 1858 forage cap, sometimes called a [...] "bummer cap" [...] or McDowell cap, which evolved directly from the shako used by the regular army earlier in the 1850s (see the design of the crown, chinstrap, brim, and buckle). Essentially, the forage cap, described by some troops as [...] "shapeless as a feedbag", was a less-expensive and more comfortable version of the earlier shako with the stiffening removed. The forage cap became the most common form of cap worn by U.S. regulars and volunteers during the American Civil War, though it is most commonly associated with the eastern theater of the war, since western troops generally preferred broad-brimmed <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> (see photos of Sherman's army parading through Washington D.C. at war's end). The forage cap appears in films such as Gettysburg, Gods and Generals, and Glory. Some Union units wore coloured variants, as some illustrative examples show: ...|$|E
