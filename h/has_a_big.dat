50|$|Research has {{consistently}} shown that, {{as far as}} birth complications are concerned, the care provider’s perception that <b>a</b> baby is <b>big</b> is more harmful than <b>an</b> actual <b>big</b> baby by itself. In a 2008 study, researchers compared what happened to women who were suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby to what happened to women who were not suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby—but who ended up having one. In the end, women who were suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby (and actually <b>had</b> one) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> triple in the induction rate, more than triple the C-section rate, and a quadrupling of the maternal complication rate, compared to women who were not suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby but who had one anyway.|$|R

5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They {{learn that the}} only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E

25|$|If a {{password}} system only stores the hash of the password, an attacker can pre-compute hash values for common passwords variants {{and for all}} passwords shorter than a certain length, allowing very rapid recovery of the password once its hash is obtained. Very long lists of pre-computed password hashes can be efficiently stored using rainbow tables. This method of attack can be foiled by storing a random value, called a cryptographic salt, along with the password. The salt is combined with the password when computing the hash, so an attacker precomputing a rainbow table would have to store for each password its hash with every possible salt value. This becomes infeasible if the salt <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> enough range, say a 32-bit number. Unfortunately, many authentication systems in common use do not employ salts and rainbow tables {{are available on the}} Internet for several such systems.|$|E

25|$|How the {{distinction}} between productive and unproductive labor is drawn obviously <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mathematical effect on the estimated total profit rate on production, if unproductive labor costs are excluded from the total variable capital outlay, and included {{in the part of}} total net output which represents total surplus value produced. If the proportion of unproductive labor increases, paradoxically the total surplus value will then also increase, with the effect of raising the rate of profit. Prof. Moseley resolves this paradoxical effect by distinguishing between primary and secondary income distributions, and between gross and net surplus value. In his account, first the total net value-added is produced by the productive workers, and then the gross wages of the unproductive workers are deducted from the gross surplus value; in that interpretation, it follows that the larger the wage-bill of unproductive workers is, the lower the netted surplus value will be. Chris Harman noted large quantitative differences in the estimates of unproductive labor by different orthodox Marxists. Moseley's calculations and his definition of unproductive labor have been criticized by other Marxists. The main objections discussed are conceptual and empirical.|$|E
