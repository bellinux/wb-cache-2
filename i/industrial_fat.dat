5000|$|Rumours {{that the}} Nazis {{produced}} soap from {{the bodies of}} concentration camp inmates circulated widely during the war. Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, {{and the production of}} soap was put under government control. The [...] "human soap" [...] rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as Reichs-Juden-Fett ("State Jewish Fat"); in German Blackletter font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for Reichsstelle für industrielle Fettversorgung ("National Center for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Fat</b> Provisioning", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise. Rumors about the origins and meaning of [...] "RIF" [...] soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia, describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters [...] "RIF" [...] inscribed on a center depression. When one of the POWs complained about the low-foam, smooth soap, the lady of the household answered it was made of [...] "Rein Juden Fett" [...] (pure Jewish fat), when asked [...] "out of human fat?", she answered [...] "No, just Jews". A version of the story is included in The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry, one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the Holocaust, assembled by Soviet writers Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman. The specific story is part of a report titled [...] "The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov" [...] attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ingredients}} of animal feed formulation, especially the fatty sources, {{play a significant}} role in the production of high-quality food of animal origin. <b>Industrial</b> <b>fat</b> by-products are a major source of feeding fats in Europe. The main objectives of the project were firstly to assess feed fats and oils for their composition and content of sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) and oxysterols, and secondly to assess the levels of cholesterol and oxycholesterols of chicken and rabbit tissues after feeding with especially formulated feeds containing trans fatty acids and oxidized lipids. The lack of standardized analytical procedure prompted the evaluation of an in-house purification method by comparing it with a number of commonly used methods for the analysis of oxysterols. The saponification and transesterification steps showed rather comparable results. A two-dimensional capillary GC column with different stationary phases (a 35 % phenyl column coupled to an apolar 5 % phenyl column) was used for better resolution of a large number of oxysterols.

40|$|Pequi is {{a native}} fruit from Brazil, found in the Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado and Atlantic Rain Forest regions. It {{is one of the}} main plants with great {{potential}} for sustainable use in Central Brazil. Among 16 [*]species comprising Caryocar genus, three are highlighted: C. brasiliense, C. villosum, and C. coriaceum, of economic importance for families in small communities of Brazilian Cerrado. They are generally organized in cooperatives and use the leaves for preparing medicinal extracts, and the fruits for culinary purposes. When the sale of fresh fruits is reduced, they produce and commercialize fruit preserves, and liqueur products, as well as extract the oil. Harvesting of mature fruits after falling from the tree while keeping some fruits at the plant is the best way for its sustainable production. The internal mesocarp contains from[*] 36 to 66 % dry weight of oil having traditional culinary, medicinal and cosmetic uses.

The proportion oftransfatty acids in typical soft margarines and low-fat spreads ranged between 0. 1 and 17 % of total fatty acids and that ofcis-unsaturated fatty acids between 55 and 81 %. Hard household margarines and <b>industrial</b> <b>fats</b> for cooking and baking (shortenings) had slightly higher proportions oftransfatty acids and highest amounts, up to 50 %, were found in fats for deep frying. Vegetable oils contained only small amounts oftransfatty acids, usually less than 1 %. Isomers of C 18 : 1 comprised up to 94 % of thetransfatty acids in hardened vegetable oils and 52 - 68 % in butter, whereas hardened fish oils showed a more even distribution oftransmonoenoic fatty acids between C 16 : 1 and C 22 : 1, and C 18 : 1 isomers contributed by 28 - 42 % to totaltransfatty acids. Fat spreads with very low content (< 1 %) oftransfatty acids were found {{in all but one}} of the countries, and a general tendency to products lower intransfatty acids was observed in most countries for soft margarines and low-fat spreads but not for <b>industrial</b> <b>fats</b> and fat products for cooking and frying.

40|$|Background and Objective—An {{association}} between biomarkers of trans fat intake and {{greater risk of}} preeclampsia has been reported but {{research in this area}} is scant. Thus, we examined the association of second trimester intake of trans fats with risk of preeclampsia and severe pre-ecalmpsia. Methods—We followed 67, 186 pregnancies of women participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort between 1998 and 2003. Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at gestation week 25 and preeclampsia diagnosis was obtained by linkage with the Danish National Patient Registry. Results—There were 1, 804 cases of preeclampsia and 402 cases of severe preeclampsia identified in the cohort. Intake of trans fats decreased during the study period as a consequence of a reduction in <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fat</b> intake. Second trimester intake of trans fats was unrelated to risk of preeclampsia or severe preeclampsia. The RR (95 % CI; p, trend) of preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia comparing top to bottom quintiles of trans fat intake were 0. 95 (0. 81, 1. 11; 0. 33) and 1. 07 (0. 78, 1. 48; 0. 92), respectively.

40|$|After the {{discovery}} that trans fat {{increases the risk of}} coronary heart disease, trans fat content of foods have considerably changed. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review available data on intakes of trans fat and its dietary sources in general populations worldwide. Data from national dietary surveys and population studies published from 1995 onward were searched via Scopus and websites of national public health institutes. Relevant data from 29 countries were identified. The most up to date estimates of total trans fat intake ranged from 0. 3 to 4. 2 percent of total energy intake (En%) across countries. Seven countries had trans fat intakes higher than the World Health Organization recommendation of 1 En%. In 16 out of 21 countries with data on dietary sources, intakes of trans fat from animal sources were higher than that from industrial sources.

Many efforts, including fermentation and genetic manipulation strategies, have been made for improving TAG production in Y. lipolytica (Papanikolaou and Aggelis 2010). It {{has been reported that}} the yield of TAG could reach up to 40 % of dry cell weight when using glycerol or <b>industrial</b> <b>fats</b> as carbon source (Papanikolaou and Aggelis 2002). In Y. lipolytica, TAG can be biosynthesized followed by the Kennedy pathway, and the delta- 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) was identified as a rate-limiting enzyme in biosynthesis pathway (Dulermo and Nicaud 2011; Kennedy 1957). Besides, genes YALI 0 E 32769 g (DGA 1) and YALI 0 E 16797 g (LRO 1), encoding major triacylglycerol synthases, play important roles in the biosynthesis pathway (Athenstaedt 2011). Additionally, the repression of TGL 3 and TGL 4, encoding triacylglycerol lipases involved in the degradation of TAG, could lead to high levels of TAG accumulation (Morin et al. 2011). Although much improvement of TAG production and lipid accumulation in Y. lipolytica has been achieved, it is still necessary to rationally discover possible limiting factors involved in TAG biosynthesis at a systems level, and in silico analyze its metabolic characteristics under a wide range of genotypic and environmental conditions.|$|R

40|$|Context What is the {{relationship}} between saturated or trans fats in our food and cardiovascular risk? To find out we must examine the totality of interventional and observational evidence, and all appropriate outcomes. The World Health Organization Nutrition Guidance Advisory Group (WHO NUGAG) recently commissioned systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which examined effects of modifying saturated or trans fat intakes on mortality or cardiovascular health 1, 2 and controlled trials on lipid outcomes (updates of these published reviews are due to be published 3, 4) as well as this systematic review of observational data (reported by de Souza et al). Methods De Souza’s systematic review included observational studies reporting associations between saturated or trans fat intakes and all-cause mortality, CHD or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, total CHD, ischaemic stroke or type 2 diabetes. The review clearly stated the questions addressed, searched widely, one reviewer assessed titles and abstracts and a second reviewer checked potentially relevant studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale plus risk of misclassification of exposure to trans fats, and used GRADE to assess confidence in the findings. Primary meta-analyses (reported here) presented most-adjusted results of high vs low intake in prospective cohorts. Findings Saturated fats: meta-analysis suggested no association between higher saturated fat intake and all-cause mortality (RR= 0. 99, 95 %CI 0. 91 - 1. 09, 5 studies, 14090 deaths, I 233 %), CVD mortality, total CHD, ischaemic stroke or type 2 diabetes (all very low GRADE evidence), but suggested non-significantly increased CHD mortality (RR= 1. 15, 95 %CI 0. 97 - 1. 36, 11 studies, 2970 deaths, I 270 %). Trans fats: meta-analysis suggested increased risk of CHD mortality (RR= 1. 28, 95 %CI 1. 09 - 1. 50, 5 studies, 1234 deaths, I 20 %) and total CHD (RR= 1. 21, 95 %CI 1. 10 - 1. 33, 6 studies, 4579 events, I 20 %) with higher total trans fat intake (moderate GRADE evidence), with similar effects for industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats. There were no consistent associations for all-cause mortality or ischaemic stroke (low to very low GRADE evidence), but the suggestion of lower diabetes risk with higher ruminant trans fat intake (RR= 0. 58, 95 %CI 0. 46 - 0. 74, 5 studies, I 230 %, very low GRADE evidence). Commentary The observational evidence needs to be seen in the context of RCTs of effects on mortality, health outcomes and lipids. Saturated fats: meta-analyses of RCTs found that reduced saturated fat reduced risk of CVD events by 17 % (RR= 0. 83, 95 %CI 0. 72 - 0. 96, 4377 people with events, I² 65 %, moderate GRADE evidence), but had no clear effects on all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CHD deaths or events (moderate GRADE evidence). Replacement of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats was associated with a statistically significant 27 % reduction in CVD events, while replacement with carbohydrate, protein or monounsaturated fats showed no significant effects 1. Meta-analyses of controlled trials found that replacing 1 % of dietary energy isoenergetically with saturated fats increased LDL cholesterol by 0. 032 mmol/L (95 %CI 0. 025 - 0. 039, 43 studies) and the most favourable total cholesterol:HDL ratio was achieved when saturated fats were replaced by polyunsaturated fats 3. The interventional and observational systematic reviews together suggest that reducing saturated fats reduces cardiovascular events, and may have a more striking effect on cardiovascular events when replacement is by polyunsaturated fats. Trans fats: systematic review found no RCTs assessing effects of reduction of trans fat intake on mortality, CVD or CHD 2. Combining trials in linear regression suggested that each 1 % of energy from total trans fats replacing monounsaturated fats increased LDL cholesterol by 0. 048 mmol/L (95 %CI 0. 037 - 0. 058), with similar effects of <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fats</b> 4. Each 1 % of energy from <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fats</b> replacing monounsaturated fats increased LDL:HDL ratio by 0. 055 mmol/L (95 %CI 0. 044 - 0. 066), and ruminant trans fats increased LDL:HDL ratio by 0. 038 mmol/L (95 %CI 0. 012 - 0. 074) 4. The balance of available evidence suggests that reducing total and <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fats</b> will reduce CHD mortality and events. Implications for practice The complete set of evidence suggests that reducing saturated and <b>industrial</b> trans <b>fats,</b> and replacing them with polyunsaturated fats, will reduce risks of CVD and CHD...|$|R

5000|$|Fats contain long {{hydrocarbon}} chains, {{which can}} either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations. In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30-40 °C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.Although trans fats are edible, consumption of trans fats {{has been shown to}} increase the risk of coronary artery disease in part by raising levels of the lipoprotein LDL (often referred to as [...] "bad cholesterol"), lowering levels of the lipoprotein HDL (often referred to as [...] "good cholesterol"), increasing triglycerides in the bloodstream and promoting systemic inflammation.

The zero trans fat was obtained via chemical interesterification of a blend of soybean oil (70 g/ 100 g) and fully hydrogenated soybean oil (30 g/ 100 g). Samples containing 1 g/ 100 g, 3 g/ 100 g, and 5 g/ 100 g STS or SE were prepared and their crystallization properties were evaluated on the basis of the solid fat content (SFC), melting point, consistency, microstructure and visualization of the three-dimensional crystalline network. Both emulsifiers contributed to SFC adequacy, enhancing the consistency of the fat. As for compatibility, both emulsifiers were compatible with the interesterified fat. This was confirmed by the change in linearity of the curves at 15 - 20 degrees C. Samples with STS presented higher fractal dimension, indicating greater organization of the crystal lattice. Similarly, the visualization of three-dimensional crystalline network showed firmer structures for samples with STS compared with the samples SE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This yielded the following results. The estimated median lifelong-averaged intake of dioxins in the population is 0. 65 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw per day. The estimate for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs is 1. 2 pg WHO-TEQ per/kg bw per day. The 90 th percentile of intake in the population is 1. 6 times higher than the median intake. The contribution of different food groups to the total intake of TEQ (dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs) is fairly uniformly distributed over the foods consumed: meat products (23 %), dairy products (27 %), fish (16 %), eggs (4 %), vegetable products (13 %), and <b>industrial</b> oils and <b>fats</b> (17 %).

The estimated median lifelong-averaged intake of indicator-PCBs in the population is 5. 6 ng per kg bw per day.

Compared with earlier intake estimations the present estimation shows a considerable reduction in intake of indicator-PCBs, albeit that this reduction flattened out during the last decade. This substantial reduction is related to the decrease in the concentration of PCBs in the majority of foodstuffs. However, {{a small part of the}} population still has a rather high intake. If this high intake only occurs for a limited period of time, it is not expected to result in adverse health effects. To provide regulators with a health-based guideline to prevent health effects of exposure to indicator PCBs, the derivation of a TDI, preferably by international bodies, is recommended. Monitoring the dietary intake of PCBs is just as important as monitoring the intake of dioxins, and attempts to decrease the exposure to both compound classes need continuous attention...|$|R
40|$|Esta tesis se basa fundamentalmente en el estudio in situ del polimorfismo de triacilgliceroles (TAGs) mayoritarios de aceites y grasas alimentarios, la determinación d{{el comportamiento}} de fases de algunas de sus mezclas binarias, y la aplicación del polimorfismo como herramienta para la autentificación de productos alimentarios. Se ha llevado a cabo la caracterización polimórfica de los TAGs POP, OPO, POO, POL, SOO, OOO y OOL, básicamente utilizando una combinación de calorimetría diferencial de barrido y difracción de rayos X con radiación sincrotrón (SAXD y WAXD). Así, se han podido monitorizar los procesos dinámicos de cristalización y las transiciones polimórficas cuando las muestras se sometían a diferentes velocidades de enfriamiento y calentamiento. Los resultados obtenidos son directamente aplicables a procesos de cristalización de aceites y grasas alimentarios, con la finalidad de obtener las propiedades deseadas del producto final, utilizando los tratamientos térmicos más eficientes. Para comprender las interacciones inter{{molecular}}es que tienen lugar entre TAGs, se ha determinado los diagramas de fases de las mezclas PPO-OPO, PPO-POO y POO-OPO. Se ha observado un comportamiento eutéctico para el sistema PPO-OPO, mientras que en los sistemas PPO-POO y POO-OPO se formaba un compuesto molecular (co-cristal) metaestable, que tendía a separarse en los componentes de origen. Mediante el uso de difracción de rayos X con micro-haz de radiación sincrotrón, se han analizado las microestructuras heterogenias de mezclas de POP-OPO. El estudio de estos agregados cristalinos esferulíticos es directamente aplicable a procesos de fraccionamiento del aceite de palma. Con la finalidad de comprender muestras grasas más complejas, se ha caracterizado el complejo comportamiento polimórfico de mezclas multi-componente de 3 a 6 TAGs. Para el caso particular del aceite de oliva, el comportamiento polimórfico viene básicamente determinado por los TAGs mayoritarios, mientras que los componentes minoritarios parecen desarrollar un papel menos crucial. Finalmente, se ha aplicado el comportamiento polimórfico como herramienta para la autentificación y detección de fraudes en productos alimentarios. Ha sido posible determinar adiciones fraudulentas de aceite de avellana en aceite de oliva virgen extra en concentraciones inferiores al 5 %, y se han podido establecer diferencias muy significativas en grasas de jamones Ibéricos de las categorías cebo y bellota. Lipids, together with proteins and carbohydrates are major nutrients and also employed as lipophilic materials in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Alimentary and <b>industrial</b> <b>fats</b> and oils (such as vegetable oils, margarine, chocolate, and confectionery fats) mainly consist of triacylglycerols (TAGs), whose molecules involve {{different types of}} fatty acid moieties. TAGs show a complicated crystallization behavior. The physicochemical properties of a TAG molecule {{are determined by the}} nature and compositions of the three fatty acid moieties. These properties must be studied not only in their pure systems but also in mixed systems. In particular, studies on binary mixture systems provide valuable information about molecular interactions among different lipid materials. This PhD thesis is based on the study of the in situ polymorphic characterization of the main TAGs of some vegetable and animal fats and oils, some of their mixtures {{and the use of the}} polymorphic behavior of edible fats and oils as a tool to determine their authentication. The polymorphic study of the triacylglycerols POP, OPO, POO, POL, SOO, OOO and OOL was in situ characterized by mainly using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) with SAXD and WAXD simultaneous measurement. The combined usage of DSC and SR-XRD or laboratory-scale X-ray diffraction enabled us to monitor the occurrence and transformation behavior at different rates of cooling and heating. The results obtained are closely related to actual crystallization processes of edible fats and oils, in which most functional polymorphic forms can be obtained by applying the most efficient thermal treatments. We also determined the phase behavior of binary mixtures of mixed-acid TAGs containing palmitic and oleic fatty acids (i. e. PPO-OPO, PPO-POO and POO-OPO). PPO-OPO system revealed an eutectic behavior, whereas PPO-POO and POO-OPO were molecular compound-forming. Long incubation periods were needed in order to thermodynamically stabilize the binary mixtures, and the results demonstrated that molecular compounds of PPO-POO and POO-OPO were metastable and tended to separate into the pure TAG components. On the other hand, microstructures of spherulites of POP-OPO binary mixtures were analyzed in neat liquid and solution (n-dodecane) systems by using synchrotron radiation microbeam X-ray diffraction (SR-mu-XRD). Due to a molecular compound formation at the 50 : 50 concentration ratio, 75 POP: 25 OPO and 25 POP: 75 OPO compositions were characterized to study how the microstructures of spherulites of the TAGs mixtures are determined when the molecular compound crystals and POP or OPO component crystals can be formed competitively. Studies of these heterogeneous microstructures in neat liquid and solution are applicable to palm oil fractionation processes by dry and solvent methods. In an attempt to make an approach to complex natural fatty samples, such as olive oil, the polymorphism of multicomponent mixtures (from 3 to 6 TAG components) was analyzed and discussed. Thus, we observed that the polymorphic behavior of an extra virgin olive oil from the Arbequina olive variety was mainly influenced by its main TAGs, whereas apparently minor components did not develop a crucial role. Furthermore, we also used the polymorphic behavior of natural fat and oils (virgin and extra virgin olive oil, and Iberian ham fat) as a tool to determine authenticity (different ham categories depending on the fattening system used) and detection of adulterations (fraudulent additions of hazelnut oil in olive oil). The combined use of DSC and preliminary chemometric calculations permitted determining fraudulent additions of raw hazelnut oil in an extra virgin olive oil (Arbequina) at concentrations below 5 %. On the other hand, highly significant differences were detected in the polymorphic behavior of Iberian ham fat from the bellota and cebo categories...|$|R

This study aimed to exalt the optimized shea butter quality and present its wide potentialities of utilization. Hence, {{the characteristics of}} beige and yellow optimized shea butters were determined. Both samples recorded very weak acid (0.280  ±  0.001 and 0.140  ±  0.001 mgKOH/g) and peroxide (0.960  ±  0.001 and 1.010  ±  0.001 mEgO 2 /kg) indexes, when the iodine indexes (52.64  ±  0.20 and 53.06  ±  0.20 gI 2 / 100  g) and the unsaponifiable matters (17.61  ±  0.01 and 17.27  ±  0.01  %) were considerable. The refractive indexes (1.454  ±  0.00 and 1.453  ±  0.00) and the pH (6.50  ±  0.30 and 6.78  ±  0.30) were statistically similar; but the specific gravity (0.915  ±  0.01 – 0.79  ±  0.01 and 0.94  ±  0.01 – 0.83  ±  0.01) and the viscosity (90.41  ±  0.20 – 20.02  ±  0.20 and 125.37  ±  0.20 – 23.55  ±  0.20 MPas) differed and decreased exponentially with the temperature increasing (35 – 65  °C), except for the specific gravity of the yellow butter which decreased linearly. The UV–Vis spectrum showed a high peak at 300  nm and a rapid decrease from 300 to 500  nm when the near infra-red one, revealed peaks at 450, 1200, 1400, 1725 and 2150  nm for all the samples. The chromatographic profile identified palmitic (16.42 and 26.36  %), stearic (32.39 and 36.36  %), oleic (38.12 and 29.09  %), linoleic (9.72 and 5.92  %) and arachidic (1.84 and 1.59  %) acids, and also exaltolide compound (1.51 and 0.68  %). The samples also contained essential minerals (Calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, etc.) carotene (550  ±  50 and 544  ±  50  ppm), vitamins A (0.065  ±  0.001 and 0.032  ±  0.001  µg/g) and E (2992.09  ±  1.90 and 3788.44  ±  1.90  ppm) in relatively important amounts; neither microbiological germs nor heavy were detected. All these valorizing characteristics would confer to the optimized shea butters good aptitude for exportation and exploitation in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.|$|R

Hence cocoa butter, palm, palmist and coco oils are so widely exploited that the Codex Stan 210 (1999) established standards {{in order to}} guide traders/industrials. Many other fats like avocado, olive, illipe and jojoba are also involved in cosmetic or pharmaceutical products {{on the basis of}} their interesting characteristics (Pontillon 1996; Joanny 2005; AAK Global 2012) Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa, syn. Butyrospermum parkii, B. paradoxa) butter which represents an important socio-economical agro-resource for its producing countries, is more and more being exploited in several industrial fields (Hall et al. 1996, Schreckenberg 2004; PNUD 2010). This increasing importance is mainly linked to its properties which would justify the wide range of its empiric uses (Hall et al. 1996). Indeed, according to these authors, shea butter has long been used in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere for medicinal, culinary, and other applications (Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa 2012; Tomaszkiewicz-Potepa and Sliwa 2012). Nowadays, shea buter, mainly the traditional one (called BIO-shea butter) interests cosmetic and pharmaceutical firms (Pontillon 1996; Elias and Carney 2004; Nahm 2011; AAK Global 2012). Nevertheless these firms are highly exigent about shea butter quality. Whereas, the traditional processes often lead to shea butter non-conform to recommended standards (Hall et al. 1996; Mégnanou and Diopoh 2008). Several studies have been undertaken to improve shea butter properties; most of these studies just focused on one or two effecting factors. Those of Mégnanou and Niamke (2013 a) took into account many factors like nuts drying mode and time, kernels quality and roasting time, so did shea butter wrapper hygienic quality. The results drew the effects of such factors on shea butter physicochemical and microbiological characteristics, and consequently induced the optimized traditional process (Bup et al. 2012; Pouliot and Elias 2013; Nsogning et al. 2014). The resulted shea butter was in conformity with the unrefined shea butter standards for trade as proposed by UEMOA (2011). Nevertheless, because of the exigencies of industrials which take into account many other properties, shea butter utilization as raw material (Cosmetic and pharmaceutical) might be linked to its exceptional quality and high potential of exploitation (Honfo et al. 2013, 2014).|$|R
40|$|Data on {{occurrence}} of dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins [PCDDs] and dibenzofurans [PCDFs]), dioxin-like PCBs (polychlorinated non-ortho and mono-ortho biphenyls) and non-dioxin-like PCBs (as {{represented by the}} so-called indicator-PCBs: congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) in food products consumed in The Netherlands that were collected in measurement programs carried out during 1998 and 1999, and combined with food consumption data to assess the dietary intake of these persistent food contaminants. The estimated median life-long-averaged intake of the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the population is 1. 2 pg WHO-TEQ (toxic equivalents) per kg body weight (bw) per day, while the estimated median life-long-averaged intake of indicator-PCBs is 5. 6 ng per kg bw per day. The contribution of different food groups to the total intake of both dioxins dioxin-like PCBs and non-dioxin-like PCBs is fairly uniformly distributed over the foods consumed: meat products (23 nd 27 °respectively), dairy products (27 nd 17 °respectively), fish (16 nd 26 °respectively), eggs (4 nd 5 °respectively), vegetable products (13 nd 7 °respectively), and <b>industrial</b> oils and <b>fats</b> (17 nd 18 °respectively). Compared with earlier intake estimations the present estimation shows a continued reduction in the intake of dioxins as well as PCBs. This reduction {{is related to the}} decrease in the concentration of these substances in the majority of foodstuffs. Nevertheless, {{a small part of the}} population still has a rather high life-long averaged intake: 8 ␘f the population is exposed to intake levels above the tolerable weekly intake for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of 14 pg WHO-TEQ per kg bw per week, as recently derived by the Scientific Committee on Food of the European Commission. For the non-dioxin-like PCBs an internationally accepted maximum intake level is still lacking. However, to provide risk managers with a health-based guideline to prevent health effects of exposure to non-dioxin-like PCBs, the (international) derivation of a tolerable daily intake is recommended. Monitoring the dietary intake of PCBs is just as important as monitoring the intake of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, and attempts to decrease the exposure to both compound classes need continuous attention...|$|R
