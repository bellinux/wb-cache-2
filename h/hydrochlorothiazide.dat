5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of <b>hydrochlorothiazide</b> does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with <b>hydrochlorothiazide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Metolazone is only {{available}} in oral preparations. Approximately 65% {{of the amount}} ingested becomes available in the bloodstream. Its half-life is approximately fourteen hours, similar to indapamide but considerably longer than <b>hydrochlorothiazide.</b> Metolazone is around ten times as potent as <b>hydrochlorothiazide.</b> The primary form of excretion is in the urine (around 80%); the remaining fifth is evenly split between biliary excretion and metabolism into inactive forms.|$|E
25|$|Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torasemide) and thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone, <b>hydrochlorothiazide,</b> or chlorothiazide) can {{increase}} kidney potassium excretion {{in people with}} intact kidney function.|$|E
25|$|Thiazide diuretics (e.g. <b>hydrochlorothiazide,</b> chlorthalidone, chlorthiazide) – may {{be useful}} for mild CHF, but {{typically}} used in severe CHF in combination with loop diuretics, resulting in a synergistic effect.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases are}} due to primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} or cancer. Other causes include sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Paget disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), vitamin D toxicity, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, and certain medications such as lithium and <b>hydrochlorothiazide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide {{and other}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, furosemide, and <b>hydrochlorothiazide</b> {{have been known}} to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is also {{formulated}} {{in combination with}} a variety of other drugs, including with <b>hydrochlorothiazide</b> as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{are used}} to treat allergies and cough, as well as {{antifungal}} and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including <b>hydrochlorothiazide,</b> metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib).|$|E
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as furosemide or <b>hydrochlorothiazide).</b> Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 2005, Cañas was {{suspended}} {{for two years and}} was forced to forfeit US$276,070 in prizes by the ATP after testing positive for a diuretic called <b>hydrochlorothiazide,</b> a substance with no benefits in itself other than as treatment for hypertension, but used to cover other forbidden substances. No traces of any other forbidden substance were found in Cañas's sample, and the player asserts the diuretic was present in some medicine prescribed by ATP doctors Mercader and Chinchila for a cold he contracted during the Acapulco tournament in Mexico. At the time of his ban, Cañas had been at the highest ranking of his career, world number eight.|$|E
500|$|During the Tour's first rest day, it was {{announced}} that Alexandr Kolobnev's (...) urine sample taken after the fifth stage had tested positive for the diuretic medication <b>hydrochlorothiazide.</b> Although it was listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as prohibited, cycling's governing body, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), only released a statement advising his team [...] "take the necessary steps to enable the Tour de France to continue in serenity...". He withdrew from the race immediately. On 1 March 2012, CAS decided that Kolobnev would only receive a warning for this, and no suspension, because his use of the drug was justified by 'medical reasons unrelated to performance'.|$|E

2500|$|The {{other major}} use of {{metolazone}} is in treating hypertension (high blood pressure). Thiazide diuretics, though usually not metolazone, are very often used alone as first-line treatment for mild hypertension. They {{are also used}} {{in combination with other}} drugs for difficult-to-treat or more severe hypertension. [...] "The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure" [...] (JNC 7) recommends thiazide diuretics as the initial medication for treatment of hypertension. <b>Hydrochlorothiazide</b> {{is by far the most}} commonly used, as it is both better-studied and cheaper (about four times) than metolazone, although as mentioned above metolazone is used in patients with moderate renal failure.|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic <b>hydrochlorothiazide</b> (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's {{success was}} not without its detractors. [...] Accusations of racism were made against the Australian team, one {{incident}} leading to a suspension for Darren Lehmann in 2003. [...] Contacts between Warne and batsman Mark Waugh and illegal bookmakers, at first kept under cover by the ACB, were later revealed by the Australian press, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given Australian cricket's earlier attitude toward match fixing allegations. [...] Warne would later be suspended from all forms of cricket for 12 months after testing positive to [...] banned diuretics <b>hydrochlorothiazide</b> and amiloride. The brand of cricket played by the Australian team was praised for its spirit and aggressiveness but critics charged that this aggressive approach lead to ugly sledging incidents such as the confrontation between McGrath and West Indian batsman, Ramnaresh Sarwan at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Tasmanian batsman Ricky Ponting would admit to an alcohol problem after incidents in India and in Sydney.|$|E
