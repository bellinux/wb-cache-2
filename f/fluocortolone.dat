A patient who had manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, PSS and polymyositis is described. Since some features of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) respond to corticosteroid treatment, <b>fluocortolone</b> was administered and both clinical and radiological remission of the oesophageal involvement were observed. At the same time, there was also a marked improvement of the cutaneous lesions.

40|$|Clobetasone {{butyrate}} {{is a new}} corticosteroid, {{selected for}} study because of its combination of good activity in the vasoconstriction test and low systemic activity in animals. Formulated as an 0. 05 % ointment and cream (Molivate) it was clinically effective in patients with eczema, its activity being significantly {{greater than that of}} hydrocortisone 1 % or <b>fluocortolone</b> 0. 2 % (Ultradil). Under conditions that predispose to maximal percutaneous absorption clobetasone butyrate ointment had minimal effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. In an animal model of cutaneous atrophy it caused less thinning of the epidermis than steroids other than hydrocortisone. Clobetasone butyrate 0. 05 % ointment and cream gave every indication of offering clinically effective topical anti-inflammatory activity with a wide margin of safety...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combined (local and systemic) steroid therapy {{on the extent of}} chronic polypoid rhinosinusitis and patient symptoms.

A nasal budesonide spray (2 · 0. 1 mg/day) and an oral <b>fluocortolone</b> medication with a daily reduction during a 12 -day period (total dose: 560 mg = group 1) and a 20 -day period (total dose: 715 mg = group 2), respectively, were administered.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether “natural creams” sold for treatment of childhood atopic eczema illegally contain corticosteroids with a newly developed rapid and simple HPLC analysis with UV detection. Material and Methods: HPLC analysis was performed using a Schimadzu LC- 2010 chromatographic system (Schimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a LC- 20 AT Prominence liquid chromatography pump with DGU- 20 A 5 Prominence degasser, a SPD-M 20 A Prominence Diode Array Detector, and a SIL- 20 AC Prominence auto sampler. Data analyses were done using Class VP 7. 3 Software. The elution was carried out on a column Purospher STAR® RP 18 e (250 x 4. 6 mm i. d., particle size 5 m), with a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water in a gradient mode, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL min- 1, at controlled column temperature (25 oC). Detection of nine different corticosteroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, <b>fluocortolone,</b> hydrocortisone, mometasone, betamethasone, beclomethasone, and diflucortolone) was carried out with DAD detector at a wavelength of 240 nm. The injection volume was 10 μl. The samples were five different creams sold for the treatment of childhood atopic eczema (marketed as steroid free) and were submitted by the state regulatory authority, Bureau of the medicines. Results: The method was fully validated according to the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) guidelines by the determination of linearity, precision, and accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). Selectivity of the method was proved with the chromatographic peak resolution obtained between each of the nine different corticosteroids and the characteristic UV spectra. Linearity of the method was tested in the range of 0. 4 – 8 μg mL- 1 for all substances analyzed. Experimental data showed high level of linearity for all corticosteroids (R 2 = 0. 9981 for diflucortolone, R 2 = 0. 9985 for methylprednisolone, R 2 = 0. 9992 for betametason, R 2 = 1. 0 for dexamethasone, prednisolone, <b>fluocortolone,</b> hydrocortisone, mometason, and beclomethasone). The high sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the values obtained for the limit of detection for the corticosteroids tested. The accuracy of the method was demonstrated by the values obtained from the recovery experiments (ranging from 98. 67...|$|E
40|$|A 46 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{referred}} to our clinic with complaints of diplopia and esotropia in his right eye that developed after a car accident. The patient had right esotropia in primary position and abduction of the right eye was totally limited. Primary deviation was over 40 prism diopters at near and distance. The patient was diagnosed with sixth nerve palsy and 18 months after trauma, he underwent right medial rectus muscle recession. Ten months after the first operation, full-thickness tendon transposition of the superior and inferior rectus muscles (with Foster suture) was performed. On the first postoperative day, slit-lamp examination revealed corneal edema, 3 + cells in the anterior chamber and an irregular pupil. According to these findings, the diagnosis was anterior segment ischemia. Treatment with 0. 1 / 5 mL topical dexamethasone drops (16 times/day), cyclopentolate hydrochloride drops (3 times/day) and 20 mg oral <b>fluocortolone</b> (3 times/day) was initiated. After 1 week of treatment, corneal edema regressed and the anterior chamber was clean. Topical and systemic steroid treatment was gradually discontinued. At postoperative 1 month, the patient was orthophoric {{and there were no}} pathologic symptoms besides the irregular pupil. Anterior segment ischemia {{is one of the most}} serious complications of strabismus surgery. Despite the fact that in most cases the only remaining sequel is an irregular pupil, serious circulation deficits could lead to phthisis bulbi. Clinical properties of anterior segment ischemia should be well recognized and in especially risky cases, preventative measures should be taken...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—The {{requirement}} for an effective, minimally toxic immunosuppressive agent remains {{a major obstacle}} to performing high risk corneal transplantation. Although therapy with cyclosporin A (CSA) allows superior graft survival, its use is limited because {{of a wide range}} of side effects. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to be a safe and effective immunosuppressive agent following renal transplantation. This prospective, randomised clinical trial was carried out to investigate the efficacy and safety of MMF in preventing corneal allograft rejection.  METHODS—Recipients of corneal transplants who were at high risk for graft failure were randomly assigned to either CSA or MMF immunosuppressive therapy. CSA was given in doses to achieve whole blood trough levels of 120 - 150 ng/ml. MMF was given in a daily dose of 2  g. Both therapy groups additionally received oral corticosteroids (<b>fluocortolone</b> 1  mg/kg) which were tapered and discontinued within the first 3  postoperative weeks. Patients were monitored closely for evidence of corneal graft rejection and adverse side effects. Drug efficacy was measured, primarily, by the number of patients who experienced at least one episode of clinical graft rejection. Safety analysis focused on reported adverse side effects and laboratory measurements.  RESULTS— 41 patients were enrolled in the study. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. 20  patients received CSA and 21  patients received MMF. Two patients in each group showed evidence of acute graft rejection which could be treated effectively by corticosteroids. All corneal grafts remained clear throughout the follow up.  CONCLUSIONS—In this study it was shown that MMF is just as effective as CSA in preventing acute rejection following high risk corneal transplantation. Mycophenolate mofetil represents a promising alternative therapeutic option in patients who are at high risk for corneal graft failure. ...|$|E
