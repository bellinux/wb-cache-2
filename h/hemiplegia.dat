5|$|In 963, {{following}} the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros {{turned his attention to the}} power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the occupation of Aleppo, had dealt a heavy blow on Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of <b>hemiplegia</b> as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that henceforth confined him to a litter. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> having the disease.|$|E
25|$|Spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> (one side being affected). Generally, {{injury to}} muscle-nerves {{controlled}} by the brain's left side will cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.|$|E
25|$|LW9.2 is for skiers with {{an upper}} {{extremity}} issue and below knee amputation or comparable disability; it includes people classes CP7 who have slight to moderate <b>hemiplegia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{that require}} urgent medical {{attention}} are seizures, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, melena, hematemesis, jaundice, fever and rigors, chest pain, <b>hemiplegia,</b> abnormal vision, dyspnea and edema.|$|E
25|$|We must not, however, lay {{too much}} {{stress on the}} copious {{shedding}} of tears by the insane, as being {{due to the lack}} of all restraint; for certain brain-diseases, as <b>hemiplegia,</b> brain-wasting, and senile decay, have a special tendency to induce weeping.|$|E
25|$|Skiers missing an arm use a {{technique}} that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. Skiers with <b>hemiplegia</b> have to be trained to use both sides of their body equally. If they do not, {{they are likely to}} fall over when their skis cross in front of them.|$|E
25|$|LW9 is a para-Alpine and para-Nordic {{standing}} skiing sport class, {{a classification}} {{defined by the}} International Paralympic Committee (IPC for people with upper and lower limb function problems, and includes cerebral palsy skiers classified CP5, CP6 and CP7, along with people with <b>hemiplegia</b> or amputations. For international skiing competitions, classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing or IPC Nordic Skiing. A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions. This classification is separated into two subclasses including LW9.1 and LW9.2.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{in vitro}} show that {{significant}} {{disruption of the}} pulmonary capillaries occurs at pressures of approximately 80 mmHg. In vivo, significant EIPH occurs above a mean pulmonary artery pressure of around 80–95 mmHg. On {{the basis of this}} theory, any factor or disease that would increase pulmonary vascular pressures (e.g. hypervolaemia) or increase the magnitude of the negative pressures in the lung during inspiration (e.g. dynamic upper airway obstruction) would increase the severity of EIPH; however neither experimentally induced laryngeal <b>hemiplegia</b> nor dorsal displacement of the soft palate increase pulmonary capillary transmural pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{conference was}} held in London in 1881. It was at this conference that Sherrington began his work in {{neurological}} research. At the conference controversy broke out. Friedrich Goltz of Strasbourg argued that localized function in the cortex did not exist. Goltz came to this conclusion after observing dogs who had parts of their brains removed. David Ferrier, who became a hero of Sherrington's, disagreed. Ferrier maintained that there was localization of function in the brain. Ferrier's strongest evidence was a monkey who suffered from <b>hemiplegia,</b> paralysis affecting {{one side of the}} body only, after a cerebral lesion.|$|E
25|$|As {{this class}} {{includes}} skiers with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. Skiers in this classification who have paralysis {{as a result of}} <b>hemiplegia,</b> stroke or polio tend to initially favour a strong side of their body when they learn to ski, which sometimes results in overskiing. Ski-bras and bungie cords are used in training to correct this. If this is not corrected, skiers are likely to fall over when their skis cross in front of them. Skiers with below the knee amputations get on and off the ski lift using the same technique as able-bodied skiers.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{estimate}} that 2-5% {{of those with}} peripheral nerve injury, and 13-70 percent of those with <b>hemiplegia</b> (paralysis of {{one side of the}} body), will develop CRPS. In addition, some studies have indicated that cigarette smoking was strikingly present in patients and is statistically linked to RSD. This may be involved in its pathology by enhancing sympathetic activity, vasoconstriction, or by some other unknown neurotransmitter-related mechanism. This hypothesis was based on a retrospective analysis of 53 patients with RSD, which showed that 68% of patients and only 37% of controls were smokers. The results are preliminary and are limited by their retrospective nature. 7% of people who have CRPS in one limb later develop it in another limb.|$|E
25|$|FHM signs overlap {{significantly}} {{with those of}} migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with hemiparesis and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) and alternating <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for weeks and months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time. These signs typically first manifest themselves in {{the first or second}} decade of life.|$|E
500|$|Warfare {{with the}} Fatimids once again {{threatened}} in 991, again because of Bakjur. He had governed Damascus until 988, {{when he was}} deposed, and then fled to Raqqa. From there, though with little support from the Fatimids, he tried to attack Aleppo. Sa'd al-Dawla, with Byzantine assistance {{in the form of}} troops under the doux of Antioch, Michael Bourtzes, was able to defeat and capture Bakjur at Na'ura east of Aleppo in April 991, and later had him executed. Nevertheless, relations with the Fatimids soured over Sa'd al-Dawla's arrest of Bakjur's children, and it was only his death of <b>hemiplegia</b> in December 991 that stopped him from attacking Fatimid possessions.|$|E
500|$|Bird {{invented the}} {{electric}} moxa in 1843. [...] The {{name is a}} reference to the acupuncture technique of moxibustion and was probably influenced by the introduction of electroacupuncture, in which the needles are augmented by an electric current, two decades earlier in France. [...] The electric moxa, however, was not intended for acupuncture. It was used to produce a suppurating sore on the skin of the patient to treat some conditions of inflammation and congestion by the technique of counter-irritation. [...] The sore had previously been created by much more painful means, such as cautery or even burning charcoal. [...] Bird's design was based on a modification of an existing instrument for the local electrical treatment of <b>hemiplegia,</b> and consisted of a silver electrode and a zinc electrode connected by copper wire. [...] Two small blisters were produced on the skin, to which the two electrodes were then connected and held in place for a few days. [...] Electricity was generated by electrolytic action with body fluids. [...] The blister under the silver electrode healed, but the one under the zinc electrode produced the required suppurating sore.Simpson, p. 8 ...|$|E

2500|$|Glenohumeral (or shoulder) {{subluxation}} {{is defined}} as a partial or incomplete dislocation of the shoulder joint that typically results from changes in the mechanical integrity of the joint. [...] Subluxation is a common problem with <b>hemiplegia,</b> or weakness of the musculature of the upper limb. [...] Traditionally this has been thought to be a significant cause of post-stroke shoulder pain, although a few recent studies have failed to show a direct correlation between shoulder subluxation and pain.|$|E
2500|$|LW9.1 is {{for people}} with upper {{extremity}} issues and above the knee amputation or similar problem with the issues and includes people classes CP7 who have severe <b>hemiplegia.</b> CP7 includes people with incomplete use of their fingers, wrists, and elbows, and {{is defined by the}} American College of Sports Medicine as [...] "Involvement hemiplegic; walk/run with limp. Good function unaffected side." [...] Hemoplegia is damage {{on one side of the}} brain that results in paralysis on the other side of the body.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Manchester, {{the son of}} a prostitute, Lee {{was brought}} up in children's homes and {{suffered}} from epilepsy and congenital spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> in his right limbs, which left him with a limp in his right leg and a compulsion to hold his right arm across his chest. [...] As an adult, he worked as a labourer and was known locally as [...] "daft Peter". In 1979, his mother remarried. His stepfather's surname was Lee, and Dinsdale changed his name as an homage to Bruce Lee.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014 {{the house}} and grounds were {{purchased}} by the DFN Charitable Foundation ("DFN Foundation") for Stepping Stones School and are to be restored {{for use as a}} school for children with <b>hemiplegia,</b> physical, medical, anxiety, and autistic spectrum difficulties. [...] The DFN Foundation states [...] "we are totally committed to the restoration of this building to its unique status as the cradle of so much of Conan Doyle’s genius. Our restoration plans encompass all of the original buildings, including the stable block. The features which made Undershaw special, specifically the stained glass windows and our proposal to faithfully re-create Conan-Doyle’s study is very exciting and will be enjoyed by our children and visitors. [...] We very much hope the local community and Conan Doyle enthusiasts from around the world will join us in visiting Undershaw and use some of the facilities which will be created." [...] The DFN Foundation was established in 2014 by David Forbes-Nixon, and aims to support the areas of education, healthcare and conservation. [...] The Foundation's revised plans for the house's conversion have been supported by the Undershaw Preservation Trust.|$|E
2500|$|Familial hemiplegic {{migraine}} (FHM) is an autosomal dominant type of {{hemiplegic migraine}} that typically includes weakness {{of half the}} body which can last for hours, days or weeks. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as ataxia, coma and paralysis. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, benign familial infantile epilepsy, and alternating <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood. There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the /-ATPase gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel α-subunit coding gene, SCN1A. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence {{of at least one}} other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of hemiplegic migraine (sporadic hemiplegic migraine) are also caused by mutations at these loci. A fourth gene that has been associated with this condition is the proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) - an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex. [...] A fifth gene associated with this condition is SLC4A4 which encodes the electrogenic NaHCO3cotransporter NBCe1.|$|E
6000|$|In February of this Year, 1747, Friedrich had {{something}} like a stroke of apoplexy; [...] "sank suddenly motionless, one day," [...] and sat insensible, perhaps for half an hour: to the terror and horror of those about him. <b>Hemiplegia,</b> he calls it; rush of blood to the head;--probably indigestion, or gouty humors, exasperated by over-fatigue. Which occasioned great rumor in the world; and at Paris, to Voltaire's horror, reports of his death.

50|$|Medial {{medullary}} syndrome, {{also known}} as inferior alternating syndrome, hypoglossal alternating <b>hemiplegia,</b> lower alternating <b>hemiplegia,</b> or Dejerine syndrome, {{is a type of}} alternating <b>hemiplegia</b> characterized by a set of clinical features resulting from occlusion of the anterior spinal artery.

50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} (superior alternating <b>hemiplegia)</b> {{is a form}} {{of stroke}} characterized by the presence of an ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis or <b>hemiplegia.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is no {{diagnostic}} test for alternating <b>hemiplegia,</b> {{which makes it}} very difficult to diagnose. Also, because alternating <b>hemiplegia</b> is extremely rare, it is frequently missed and the patient is often misdiagnosed. Proper diagnosis, however, is critical for early treatment of the disorder. There are many criteria that can help in the proper general diagnosis of alternating <b>hemiplegia.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} brain dysfunctions that can account for the cause for spastic <b>hemiplegia.</b> Spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> occurs either at birth or in the womb. The cause can be all types of strokes, head injuries, hereditary diseases, brain injuries and infections. Malformations of the veins or arteries {{in any part of}} the body can lead to spastic <b>hemiplegia.</b> The artery most commonly affected is the middle cerebral artery. Unborn and newborn babies are susceptible to strokes. Leukodystrophies are a group of hereditary diseases that are known to cause spastic <b>hemiplegia.</b> Brain infections that cause spastic <b>hemiplegia</b> are meningitis, multiple sclerosis, and encephalitis. The spasticity occurs when the afferent pathways in the brain are compromised and the communication between the brain to the motor fibers is lost. When the inhibitory signals to deactivate the stretch reflex is lost the muscle remains in a constant contracted state. With spastic <b>hemiplegia,</b> one upper extremity and one lower extremity is affected, so cervical, lumbar and sacral segments of the spinal column can be affected.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{the main}} {{distinction}} between an UMN and LMN lesion {{is that in}} the former, there is <b>hemiplegia</b> of the contralateral mid- and lower-face, whereas in the latter, there is complete <b>hemiplegia</b> of the ipsilateral face.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{hemiparesis}} and <b>hemiplegia</b> is stroke. Strokes can cause a variety of movement disorders, depending on the location and severity of the lesion. <b>Hemiplegia</b> is common when the stroke affects the corticospinal tract. Other causes of <b>hemiplegia</b> include spinal cord injury, specifically Brown-Séquard syndrome, traumatic brain injury, or disease affecting the brain. As a lesion that results in <b>hemiplegia</b> occurs in the brain or spinal cord, hemiplegic muscles display features of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Features other than weakness include decreased movement control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), spasticity, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and decreased endurance.|$|E
