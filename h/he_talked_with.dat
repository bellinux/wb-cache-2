He introduced the first Labour broadcast, in 1951, in which <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Sir Hartley Shawcross. Mayhew also became {{known as one of}} the fiercest opponents of unilateral nuclear disarmament in the Labour Party. He also served as Shadow War Secretary from 1960 to 1961 and as a spokesman on foreign affairs from 1961 to 1964.|$|E

During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred, and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said that the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.|$|E

500|$|In {{his rookie}} year, Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games {{at second base}} and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Robinson via telephone, the two {{encouraging}} each other. [...] "And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league.|$|E
500|$|Later in June, Feige {{stated the}} film was still {{intended}} to be released on the July 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014. Feige elaborated that [...] "much of the movie will still be based very much on [...] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. [...] " [...] {{wanted to be sure}} that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad," [...] Feige continued. [...] "He looked at everything, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> us, and he said 'Number one, I agree with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I never even thought of another person. ... When I saw him, I was impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E

500|$|When, in 1946, Isma'il al-Azhari of the Sudanese al-Ashiqqa party began seeking {{support for}} {{unification}} of the Nile Valley, Abd al-Rahman was strongly {{opposed to any}} hint that the king of Egypt might have authority of any kind in Sudan. He and his followers set up an [...] "Independence Front" [...] and organized huge demonstrations throughout Sudan against the draft Anglo-Egyptian agreement on Sudan. In November 1946, Abd al-Rahman left with a delegation for London via Cairo. Completely ignored by the Egyptian government in Cairo, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> British Prime Minister Clement Attlee for two hours in London. When Attlee asked why the Sudanese had not spoken up while Egypt pressed its claims over Sudan for the last seventy years, Abd al-Rahman said that was because the British had excluded them from any talks. He {{went on to say}} the Sudanese would fight with all their power for independence.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Lang's {{relationship}} with his curates was generally formal. They were aware of his ambition and felt that he sometimes {{spent too much time}} on his outside interests such as his All Souls Fellowship, but were nevertheless impressed by his efficiency and his powers of oratory. The Church historian Adrian Hastings singles out Portsea under Lang as an example of [...] "extremely disciplined pastoral professionalism". Lang may have realised that he was destined for high office; he is reported to have practised the signature [...] "Cosmo Cantuar" [...] during a relaxed discussion with his curates ("Cantuar" [...] is part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's formal signature). In January 1898 he was invited by Queen Victoria to preach at Osborne House, her Isle of Wight home. Afterwards <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the Queen who, Lang records, suggested that he should marry. Lang replied that he could not afford to as his curates cost too much. He added: [...] "If a curate proves unsatisfactory I can get rid of him. A wife is a fixture." [...] He was summoned on several more occasions and in the following January was appointed an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. These visits to Osborne were the start of a close association with the Royal Family which lasted for the rest of Lang's life. As one of the Queen's chaplains, he assisted in the funeral arrangements after her death in January 1901.|$|E

500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he {{is featured}} wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band [...] "Puscifer". When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies [...] "Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?" [...] He also appears in episode 2.6, [...] "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop", {{as one of the}} viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying [...] "Now is not the time", waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appear in the [...] "music video sex scene" [...] on its DVD. Keenan appeared {{on the cover of the}} May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, [...] "Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know what he looks like, how <b>he</b> <b>talked.</b> <b>With</b> Satan there's so much gray area." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his office}} with Finney and two detectives, Brussel {{examined}} the crime-scene photos and letters and discussed the bomber's metal-working and electrical skills. [...] As <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the police, Brussel developed {{what he called}} a kind of [...] "portrait" [...] of the bomber, what would now be called an offender profile. The bomber's belief that he had been wronged by Consolidated Edison and by others acting in concert with Consolidated Edison seemed to dominate his thoughts, leading Brussel to conclude that the bomber was suffering from paranoia, a condition he describes as [...] "a chronic disorder of insidious development, characterized by persistent, unalterable, systematized, logically constructed delusions." [...] Based on the evidence and his own experience dealing with psychotic criminals, Brussel put forth a number of theories beyond the obvious grudge against Consolidated Edison: ...|$|E

2500|$|From the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico {{where he}} worked, Fry {{had planned to}} join the July 4, 1949 evening festivities in nearby Las Cruces but missed the last bus. Finding the Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ) where he stayed too hot, he decided to explore a path in the desert {{he had never been}} down. [...] There, Fry claimed a 30-foot (10 m) diameter, 16 foot (5 m) high [...] "oblate spheroid" [...] landed in front of him, and he talked {{remotely}} with the pilot who operated the craft from a [...] "mother ship" [...] 900 miles (1400km) above Earth.

2500|$|The trial {{ended on}} June 28, 1865. Surratt was so ill {{the last four}} days of the trial that she was {{permitted}} to stay in her cell. Both legal teams appeared to have flaws in their cases, and except for Reverdy Johnson, neither team employed highly-skilled attorneys. The government's case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> Surratt and could have verified Lloyd's version of the [...] "shooting irons" [...] story or Metropolitan Police Chief A.C. Richards whose investigation had had the most success {{in the early days}} of the investigation. The government did not fully investigate Booth's meetings with Surratt at noon or the evening of the murder, and its questioning and cross-examination of witnesses was poorly prepared and weak. What is most important is that the government had botched the attempt to apprehend John, Jr. The defense's case, too, had a problem. The defense never followed up on inconsistencies in Weichmann's chronology of Mary's last visit to the tavern, which could have undermined Weichmann's entire credibility.|$|E
2500|$|While {{all but one}} justice {{personally}} rejected segregation, the self-restraint faction {{questioned whether}} the Constitution gave the Court the power to order its end, especially since the Court, in several cases decided after Plessy, had upheld the doctrine of [...] "separate but equal" [...] as constitutional. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only a recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate, dominated by southerners, confirmed his appointment. Warren told his colleagues after oral argument that he believed racial segregation violated the Constitution and that only if one considered African Americans inferior to whites could the practice be upheld. But he did not push for a vote. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> <b>with</b> the justices and encouraged them to talk with each other as he sought a common ground on which all could stand. Finally he had eight votes, and the last holdout, Stanley Reed of Kentucky, agreed to join the rest. Warren drafted the basic opinion in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by {{all the members of}} the Court.|$|E
