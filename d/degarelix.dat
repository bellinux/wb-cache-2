50|$|Testosterone is a male {{hormone that}} {{promotes}} growth of many prostate tumours and therefore reducing circulating testosterone to very low (castration) levels {{is often the}} treatment goal {{in the management of}} advanced prostate cancer. <b>Degarelix</b> has an immediate onset of action, binding to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and blocking their interaction with GnRH. This induces a fast and profound reduction in luteinising hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn, testosterone suppression.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{different}} medicines, LHRH agonists and antagonists, which both lower the amount of testosterone made by the testicles. They work inhibiting the formation of LH in the pituitary gland. The LHRH agonists produce a sudden increase on levels of testosterone followed by a huge falling, process called flare, whereas LHRH antagonists decrease directly the amount of testosterone. Some {{of the most common}} LHRH agonist and antagonist active substances are leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, histrelin and <b>degarelix.</b>|$|E
50|$|GnRH antagonists (receptor blockers) such as <b>degarelix</b> are a {{new type}} of {{hormonal}} therapy for prostate cancer. These agents are synthetic peptide derivatives of the natural GnRH decapeptide - a hormone that is made by neurons in the hypothalamus. GnRH antagonists compete with natural GnRH for binding to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. This reversible binding blocks the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. The reduction in LH subsequently leads to a rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone release from the testes and subsequently reduces the size and growth of the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in the patient's blood. Measuring PSA levels is a way to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the GnRH agonists, {{which cause}} an initial {{stimulation}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA), leading to a surge in testosterone levels, and under certain circumstances, a flare-up of the tumour, GnRH antagonists do not cause a surge in testosterone or clinical flare. Clinical flare is a phenomenon that occurs in patients with advanced disease, which can precipitate a range of clinical symptoms such as bone pain, urethral obstruction, and spinal cord compression. Drug agencies have issued boxed warnings regarding this phenomenon in the prescribing information for GnRH agonists. As testosterone surge does not occur with GnRH antagonists, {{there is no need}} for patients to receive an antiandrogen as flare protection during prostate cancer treatment. GnRH agonists also induce an increase in testosterone levels after each reinjection of the drug - a phenomenon that does not occur with GnRH antagonists such as <b>degarelix.</b>|$|E

METHODS: Patients receiving <b>degarelix</b> who completed the 1 -year trial continued on 80 mg (n = 125) or 160 mg (n = 126) maintenance doses. Patients who received leuprolide were rerandomized to <b>degarelix</b> 240 / 80 mg (n = 69) or 240 / 160 mg (n = 65). Safety and tolerability were assessed (primary end point), as well as testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels and prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (secondary end points). RESULTS: Adverse event frequency was similar between both the groups. Adverse events included initial injection site reactions, hot flushes, and increased weight. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen values during the extension study were similar to those seen during the 1 -year trial in patients who continued on <b>degarelix</b> or crossed over from leuprolide.

Commonly, this is achieved with medical androgen deprivation rather than surgical intervention as the permanence and psychological effects of the latter are unacceptable for most patients. <b>Degarelix</b> is a third generation antagonist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH, also termed gonadotropin-releasing hormone) for the first-line treatment of androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer. <b>Degarelix</b> acts directly on the pituitary receptors for LHRH, blocking the action of endogenous LHRH. The use of <b>degarelix</b> eliminates the initial undesirable surge in gonadotropin and testosterone levels, which is produced by agonists of LHRH. <b>Degarelix</b> is the most comprehensively studied and widely available LHRH antagonist worldwide. Clinical trials have demonstrated that <b>degarelix</b> has a long-term efficacy similar to the LHRH agonist leuprolide in achieving testosterone suppression in patients with prostate cancer. <b>Degarelix,</b> however, produces a faster suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), with no testosterone surges or microsurges, and thus prevents the risk of clinical flare in advanced disease. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that treatment with <b>degarelix</b> results in improved disease control when compared with an LHRH agonist in terms of superior PSA progression-free survival, suggesting that <b>degarelix</b> likely delays progression to castration-resistant disease and has a more significant impact on bone serum alkaline phosphatase and follicle-stimulating hormone. <b>Degarelix</b> is usually well tolerated, with limited toxicity and no evidence of systemic allergic reactions in clinical studies. <b>Degarelix</b> thus represents an important addition to the hormonal armamentarium for therapy of advanced androgen-dependent prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in efficacy and safety outcomes in a pooled analysis of trials comparing <b>degarelix</b> with LHRH agonists. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were pooled from five prospective, phase 3 or 3 b randomised trials (n= 1925) of <b>degarelix</b> and leuprolide or goserelin in men requiring androgen deprivation therapy {{for the treatment}} of prostate cancer. Patients received either 3 mo (n= 467) or 12 mo (n= 1458) of treatment. INTERVENTION: Men were randomised to receive <b>degarelix</b> (n= 1266), leuprolide (n= 201), or goserelin (n= 458). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analyses were supported by the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for disease-related baseline factors, to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of efficacy and safety outcomes. The Fisher exact test compared crude incidences of adverse events. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) was improved in the <b>degarelix</b> group (HR: 0. 71; p= 0. 017).

40|$|As {{part of its}} Single Technology Appraisal Process, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{invited the}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>degarelix</b> (Ferring Pharmaceuticals) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of <b>degarelix</b> {{for the treatment of}} advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company’s submission to NICE. The evidence, which included a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of <b>degarelix</b> versus leuprorelin, found that <b>degarelix</b> was non-inferior to leuprorelin for reduction of testosterone levels and that <b>degarelix</b> achieved a more rapid suppression of prostate-specific antigen levels and subsequently decreased incidences of testosterone flare associated with luteinising hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonists. However, protection against testosterone flare for the comparators in the clinical trials was not employed in line with UK clinical practice. Further claims surrounding overall survival, cardiovascular adverse events and clinical equivalence of the comparator drugs from six RCTs of <b>degarelix</b> should be regarded with caution because of flaws and inconsistencies in the pooling of trial data to draw conclusions. The cost-effectiveness evidence included a de novo economic model. Based on the ERG’s preferred base case, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (ICER) for <b>degarelix</b> versus 3 -monthly triptorelin was £ 14, 798 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Design, setting, and participants: The 1 -yr study was of open-label, randomised design and involved 187 patients (range: 52 - 93 yr, median: 72 yr) with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate and a baseline PSA > 2 ng/ml. Results and limitations: At baseline, median serum testosterone was 4. 13 ng/mI (range: P 2 S-P 75, 3. 37 - 5. 19 ng/ml) and PSA was 27. 6 ng/ml (range: P 25 -P 75, 11. 9 -S 5. 0 ng/ml). On day 3, 88 % and 92 % of patients in the groups to whom 200 -mg and 240 -mg initial doses of <b>degarelix</b> were administered, respectively, had testosterone levels <= 0. 5 ng/ml.

Results: Patients received <b>degarelix</b> monotherapy (n = 972) or LHRH agonist (n = 483) of whom 57 also received AA. Overall, prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA PFS) was improved with <b>degarelix</b> versus LHRH agonist + AA (Cox proportional hazards regression model-adjusted HR for PSA PFS failure was 0. 56 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 33 - 0. 97, p = 0. 038]). To compensate for a higher proportion of patients with metastases, Gleason score 7 - 10, and PSA > 20 ng/ml in the LHRH agonist + AA group, a case-control analysis using a conditional logistic regression model was utilized. This resulted in an OR for PSA PFS of 0. 42 (95 % CI 0. 20 - 0. 89; p = 0. 023) in the overall population, and 0. 35 (95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 96; p = 0. 042) in patients with PSA > 50 ng/ml at baseline, when treated with <b>degarelix</b> versus LHRH agonists + AA. There were a small number of deaths, 1. 9 % with <b>degarelix</b> and 7 % with LHRH agonists + AA (case-control analysis OR = 0. 37; p = 0. 085). Conclusions: <b>Degarelix</b> monotherapy produced a more favorable effect on PSA PFS outcomes than a LHRH agonist + AA flare protection therapy in patients with prostate cancer when a case-control analysis was used to compensate for differences between treatment groups...|$|E
40|$|<b>Degarelix</b> is a gonadrotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{receptor}} (GnRHR) antagonist used {{in patients}} with prostate cancer who need androgen deprivation therapy. GnRHRs {{have been found in}} extra-pituitary tissues, including prostate, which may be affected by the GnRH and GnRH analogues used in therapy. The direct effect of <b>degarelix</b> on human prostate cell growth was evaluated. Normal prostate myofibroblast WPMY- 1 and epithelial WPE 1 -NA 22 cells, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) - 1 cells, androgen-independent PC- 3 and androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, as well as VCaP cells derived from a patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer were used. Discriminatory protein and lipid fingerprints of normal, hyperplastic, and cancer cells were generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). The investigated cell lines express GNRHR 1 and GNRHR 2 and their endogenous ligands. <b>Degarelix</b> treatment reduced cell viability in all prostate cell lines tested, {{with the exception of the}} PC- 3 cells; this can be attributed to increased apoptosis, as indicated by increased caspase 3 / 7, 8 and 9 levels. WPE 1 -NA 22, BPH- 1, LNCaP, and VCaP cell viability was not affected by treatment with the GnRH agonists leuprolide and goserelin. Using MALDI MS, we detected changes in m/z signals that were robust enough to create a complete discriminatory profile induced by <b>degarelix.</b> Transcriptomic analysis of BPH- 1 cells provided a global map of genes affected by <b>degarelix</b> and indicated that the biological processes affected were related to cell growth, G-coupled receptors, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that (i) the GnRH antagonist <b>degarelix</b> exerts a direct effect on prostate cell growth through apoptosis; (ii) MALDI MS analysis provided a basis to fingerprint degarelix-treated prostate cells; and (iii) the clusters of genes affected by <b>degarelix</b> suggest that this compound, in addition to its known use in the treatment of prostate cancer, may be efficacious in BPH...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{assessed}} the cardiovascular safety profile of <b>degarelix,</b> a new gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. Materials and Methods: This {{is the first}} report to our knowledge on cardiovascular safety data from a completed 1 -year randomized controlled trial of leuprolide acetate vs <b>degarelix.</b> Outcomes considered in these analyses included the QT interval by central reading and analysis, and cardiovascular adverse events. On multivariate analyses relationships between selected baseline factors and cardiovascular events were evaluated. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between treatment groups for mean change in Fridericia's correction of QT during the trial. Markedly abnormal Fridericia's correction of QT values (500 milliseconds or greater) were observed in only a small number of subjects by treatment group, that is 2 (less than 1 %) in the pooled <b>degarelix</b> group and 2 (1 %) in the leuprolide group. Supraventricular arrhythmias were the most common type of arrhythmias, affecting 2 % of subjects in the pooled <b>degarelix</b> group and 4 % in the leuprolide group. Other arrhythmias occurred in 1 % or less of subjects by treatment group. The most frequently reported cardiac disorder was ischemic heart disease, which occurred in 4 % of subjects treated with <b>degarelix</b> and 10 % of those on leuprolide. Cox proportional hazard ratio estimates for selected baseline covariates showed a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events by age (p = 0. 0459) and systolic blood pressure (p = 0. 0061). Conclusions: In men with prostate cancer <b>degarelix</b> and leuprolide have similar cardiovascular safety profiles. These observations suggest that the cardiovascular events associated with both agents result from hypogonadism rather than a direct drug effec...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PC) is a {{very common}} tumor among men: in Italy its {{prevalence}} in 2006 was 0. 9 %. Androgen deprivation therapy {{is a way to}} treat hormone-responsive PC by decreasing testosterone levels. GnRH-analogues, including GnRH-agonists and GnRH-antagonists, are effective for this purpose. AIM: This article presents a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a semi-Markov model comparing the GnRH-antagonist <b>degarelix</b> and GnRH-agonist leuprolide in the treatment of hormone-dependent advanced prostate cancer {{from the perspective of the}} Regional Health Service in Veneto Region (Italy). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effectiveness data were retrieved by a 12 -month phase III non-inferiority clinical trial, comparing <b>degarelix</b> and 7, 5 mg leuprolide in 610 patients treated for hormone-dependent prostate cancer. Epidemiological data came from a national database and were referred to Veneto Region. The values of the healthcare resources were calculated using regional and national prices (€ 2012). The model considers 3 exhaustive and mutually exclusive health status: first-line treatment, further-lines treatment and death. It lasts 10 years, with 28 days per cycle. The entry in the model is hypothesized at the age of 70 (the age with most PCs in Veneto Region). Effectiveness endpoints were life years saved and quality-adjusted life years, using 3 % social discount rate. The incremental cost per QALY was related to the range of acceptability proposed by the Associazione Italiana di Economia Sanitaria (€ 25, 000 - 40, 000). The budget impact was calculated on a 5 -year time horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on every hypothesis of the model. RESULTS: <b>Degarelix</b> resulted in minor costs if compared to 7. 5 mg leuprolide (€ 20, 511. 64 vs 22, 256. 49). The cost-driver was chemotherapic care (32. 45 % <b>degarelix</b> vs 44. 30 % 7. 5 mg leuprolide). Life years saved were the same for both the alternatives (5. 58), while QALYs obtained were higher in <b>degarelix</b> vs. 7. 5 mg leuprolide (4. 41 vs. 4. 10). QALY better data probably could results from greater delay to disease progression in castrate resistant phase with <b>degarelix</b> than comparator and also due to superior symptoms relief. Therefore <b>degarelix</b> is dominant compared to the agonist. The probability for <b>degarelix</b> to be cost-effective increases with the increasing of the threshold for incremental QALY, being 69. 95 %, 93. 76 %, 95. 55 %, and 97. 42 % for threshold values equal to € 0, € 25, 000, € 40, 000, and € 100, 000, respectively. The use of <b>degarelix</b> in Veneto Region instead of 7. 5 mg leuprolide would result, after a five-year period, in total savings for the Regional Health Service equal to € 4, 783, considering the treatment of 259 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of hormone-dependent advanced prostate cancer PC, <b>degarelix</b> is thought to be an economically rational investment of resources for the Regional Health Service of Veneto Region because it’s dominant, in term of cost-effectiveness, to the comparator (agonist) thanks to superior QALY and reduced costs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{compare the}} {{activity}} of <b>degarelix,</b> a new gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) blocker, with leuprolide depot 7. 5 mg in the control of total serum alkaline phosphatase (S-ALP) levels in patients with prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS In the randomized, phase III trial (CS 21), patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (all stages), were randomized {{to one of three}} regimens: <b>degarelix</b> subcutaneous 240 mg for 1 month followed by monthly maintenance doses of 80 mg or 160 mg, or intramuscular leuprolide 7. 5 mg/month. Patients receiving leuprolide could also receive antiandrogens for flare protection. We report exploratory S-ALP analyses from CS 21, focusing on the comparison of <b>degarelix</b> 240 / 80 mg with leuprolide 7. 5 mg, in line with the recent approvals of this dose by the USA Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. RESULTS Overall, 610 patients were included, with a median age of 73 years and median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 19. 0 ng/mL. Baseline S-ALP levels were high in metastatic patients and highest in patients with metastatic disease and a haemoglobin level of = 50 ng/mL. Between-treatment differences in patients with metastatic disease and those with a PSA level of >= 50 ng/mL were significant at day 364 (P = 0. 014 and 0. 007, respectively). CONCLUSION Patients with metastatic disease or those with PSA levels of >= 50 ng/mL at baseline had greater reductions in S-ALP levels with <b>degarelix</b> than with leuprolide. Patients in the <b>degarelix</b> group maintained S-ALP suppression throughout the study, in contrast to those in the leuprolide group. This suggests that <b>degarelix</b> might offer better S-ALP control than leuprolide and might prolong control of skeletal metastases, compared with GnRH agonists, over a 1 -year treatment period...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{utility of}} {{conventional}} prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA) measurements in blood for monitoring rapid responses to treatment {{for prostate cancer}} is limited because of its slow elimination rate. Prior {{studies have shown that}} free PSA (fPSA), intact PSA (iPSA) and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK 2) are eliminated more rapidly after radical prostatectomy. In contrast, all three markers have similarly slow elimination rates after castration induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, possibly due to the slow onset of castration. Therefore, we assessed elimination rates of tPSA, fPSA, iPSA and hK 2 after rapid induction of castration with <b>degarelix</b> (Firmagon (R)), a novel GnRH antagonist. Methods: This study included 24 patients treated with <b>degarelix.</b> Blood was taken at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after injection of <b>degarelix.</b> Free and total PSA were measured with a commercial dual-label assay, and with inhouse research assays of intact PSA and hK 2. Results: Median (interquartile range, IQR) tPSA at baseline was 23. 4 (15. 8, 59. 8). Twenty-two patients (92 %) reached castrate levels of testosterone within 24 h of <b>degarelix</b> initiation, and all patients did so within 72 h. All kallikrein forms declined in an exponential fashion after <b>degarelix</b> administration. The median time to 50 % reduction in biomarker level was 8 - 9 days for tPSA or complexed PSA vs. 2 - 4 days for hK 2, iPSA and fPSA. The percentage eliminated at day 3 and day 7 was significantly higher for hK 2, iPSA and fPSA than for tPSA (all p< 0. 02), while tPSA and complexed PSA were similar. Conclusions: The rapid decline of fPSA, iPSA and hK 2 after fast induction of castration with <b>degarelix</b> is similar to that reported after prostatectomy and offers a novel, informative method to monitor rapid onset of therapeutic action targeting signaling of the androgen receptor...|$|E
40|$|Objective In {{patients}} {{with prostate cancer}} (PCa), prostate enlargement may give rise to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS); many patients suffer from moderate-to-severe symptoms.
