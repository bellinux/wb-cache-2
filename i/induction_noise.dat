50|$|The {{intake system}} was {{simplified}} in shape to reduce induction resistance and noise. A larger twin-chambered air box designed to dampen resonant intake tract noise replaces the previous Accord's smaller, single-chamber damper. The new box is 10.7 liters in capacity, {{compared to the}} older unit's 8.2 liters. The larger box also {{eliminates the need for}} a second resonant-frequency damper and an additional side branch. The 2.3-liter Accord 4-cylinder engine intake manifold has been redesigned to add more power and lower emissions. The individual cast-aluminum runners have revised dimensions to better take advantage of the different air-flow characteristics of the 2.3-liter engine. A larger plenum chamber reduces <b>induction</b> <b>noise</b> and the incorporation of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) ports into the plenum, upstream of the throttle plates, eliminates the need for a separate fitting and port in each intake runner.|$|E
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and <b>induction</b> <b>noise</b> when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from oiling up) but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|E
30|$|The {{internal}} combustion (IC) engine {{is a major}} source of automobile noise (Sanjid et al. 2014), and as the standards for automobile noise are becoming increasingly strict, there is greater demand for quieter engines. The process of induction plays a large part in creating engine noise. For some small high-speed machines and some other large turbochargers, the <b>induction</b> <b>noise</b> can reach up to 5  dB (A) higher than the engine noise sometimes (Chiatti et al. 2015).

Recently, Murdoch proposed a temperature-based covert channel where information is transmitted by remotely inducing and measuring changes of temperature of an unwitting intermediate host. The channel was invented {{for the purpose of}} attacking anonymous servers, but could also be used for general-purpose covert communications. We propose an empirical method for estimating realistic (and previously unknown) capacities for this channel. In example scenarios with different intermediate hosts and different levels of temperature <b>induction</b> and <b>noise</b> we find the channel capacity is up to 20. 5 bits per hour, but it almost halves to 10. 3 bits per hour with higher noise or more effective cooling at the intermediate host...|$|R
40|$|A systemis describedfor {{the long-distance}} {{transmission}} of digital positional {{information from a}} scintillation camera to a computer through a shielded multiple-twisted-pair cable. Data errors caused by <b>noise</b> <b>induction</b> along the cable are completely eliminated. The operation of the complete interface and its routine testing are described. The cable transmission of data from a scintilla tion camera to a digital computer over long distances presents problems. The major one is the <b>induction</b> of <b>noise</b> {{along the length of}} the cable, thereby causing data errors (1). Dowsett and Roberts (2) have suc ceeded in transmitting analog signals over 1, 450 ft. However, their approach is expensive: it requires high-quality amplifiers and coaxial cable and does not completely eliminate the possibility of induced noise. More recentlyGrant et ai (3) successfullytrans mitted digital signals over 450 ft. Their approach eliminates induced noise and the need for high quality amplifiers, but it also is expensive because it uses shielded twin coaxial cable. Furthermore, they transmit their digital signals serially, thus increasing the transmission time. This paper describes an inexpensive method for sending digital signals in parallel from a Dyna camera- 2 C (Picker Corp., Mentor, Ohio) to a PDP 1 i computer 400 ft away. MATERIALS AND METHODS The resolution of the scintillation camera and the storage capacity of the computer dictated that the digital Xâ€”Ypositional signals be described by two 7 -bit words.

40|$|The {{considerable}} effort invested by {{automobile manufacturers}} to attenuate various noise sources within the passenger compartment {{has resulted in}} other sources such as <b>induction</b> <b>noise</b> having become more noticeable. This study was undertaken to investigate the feasability of using a non conventional noise cancellation technique to improve the acoustic performance of the induction system by introducing exhaust noise into the intake system through a manifold bridge. The effectiveness of this technique was first investigated using Ricardo Wave, a computational, engine simulation, software program. Using a one-dimensional, finite-difference approach to analyse {{the dynamics of the}} pressure waves, mass flows, and energy losses within the ducts, an optimized bridge configuration was determined. A physical model incorporating the design of the optimized bridge was installed and tested on a motored engine for comparison to the numerical results. The realized attenuation of <b>induction</b> <b>noise</b> due to the manifold bridge was evaluated using 1 / 12 th octave frequency spectra and three-dimensional colour maps of both the unmodified and bridged engine for steady state and transient engine cases. A sound quality analysis was also performed using various psychoacoustic metrics including loudness, sharpness, roughness and fluctuation strength. Both the numerical and experimental models demonstrated reductions in the overall sound level measured at the intake opening with the experimental results being more favourable. While the results of the sound quality analysis correlated well between the numerical and experimental models, the success of the bridging technique was somewhat ambiguous, depending on the sound quality metric used. As with the traditional analysis techniques, the reported loudness was lower for the numerical and experimental bridged engines. Sharpness was found not to be a relevant metric in this study {{due to a lack of}} high frequency content to the noise. Depending on the engine speed, values for roughness and fluctuation strength were either improved or diminished with the implementation of the manifold bridge. For the conditions tested, implementation of the manifold bridge has demonstrated promise. Before it can be declared commercially viable, however, further considerations such as the effects of exhaust gas recirculation and fired engine tests, are warranted.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of <b>induction</b> machine magnetic <b>noise</b> demands to determine accurately all the stator and rotor harmonic flux density components.

By characterizing this permeance through a relation considering the stator-rotor interactions with accuracy, it is shown that the stator induces rotoric e. m. f. waves whose frequency and amplitude are much higher that those of the corresponding fundamental. This phenomenon, qualified as slotting resonance, can cause no negligible secondary effects which are little or not exploited until now. Similar phenomenon appears in the stator induced by the rotor.

40|$|In {{most natural}} {{listening}} environments, noise occludes objects of interest, {{and it would}} be beneficial for an organism to correctly identify those objects. When a sound of interest ("foreground" sound) is interrupted by a loud noise, subjects perceive the entire sound, even if the noise was intense enough to completely mask a part of it. This phenomenon can be exploited to create an illusion: when a silent gap is introduced into the foreground and high-intensity noise is superimposed into the gap, subjects report the foreground as continuing through the noise although that portion of the foreground was deleted. This phenomenon, referred to as auditory induction or amodal completion, is conceptually similar to visual induction, fill-in, illusory motion, and illusory contours. Two rhesus macaque monkeys performed a task designed to assess auditory induction. They were trained to discriminate complete stimuli from those containing a silent gap in the presence of two types of noise. Interrupting noise temporally coincided only with the gap, and in humans this causes <b>induction.</b> Surrounding <b>noise</b> temporally encompassed the entire foreground, and in humans this causes masking without auditory induction. Consistent with previous human psychophysical results, macaques showed better performance with surrounding masking noise than interrupting noise designed to elicit induction. These and other control experiments provide evidence that primates may share a general mechanism to perceptually complete missing sounds...|$|R
30|$|From these results, it is {{convenient}} {{that the total}} output noise of the implemented amplifying and filtering chain is mostly defined by the <b>induction</b> coil thermal <b>noise</b> and less by the preamplifier noise. In particular, experimental measurements on several outdoor environments indicate that voltage gain amplifier stage should have a passband gain of 4 for better performance on Schumann measuring and recording resonances. In that case, the equivalent rms input noise of the last amplifying and filtering chain stage approximates to 5135.3  nV. Besides, each system stage has its own impact on the total output noise. That impact is determined by each stage noise value and its sequential arrangement at our amplifying and filtering chain system. The last consideration {{is based on the}} fact that the stage voltage noise experiences lower gain and thus exhibits less effect on the total system noise as it arranges closer to the output of our chain.|$|R

In this paper we made an attempt to undertake the study of four types of noise induced in the handwritten Kannada documents and their removal using seven types of filters. The comparative study is conducted with the help of seven different image quality measures. The images are also tested with different Gaussian noise densities ranging from 20 % to 100 %. From the experimental results it is seen that median, average and wiener filters perform better compared to Laplacian, Canny, Robert and Prewitt. It is also observed that median filter is better in removing salt and pepper noise. The wiener and average filters are best to remove Gaussian and Poisson noise.

40|$|Multipotent differentiation, where cells adopt one {{of several}} cell fates, is a {{determinate}} and orchestrated procedure that often incorporates stochastic mechanisms in order to diversify cell types. How these stochastic phenomena interact to govern cell fate are poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate decision making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of differentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work, {{we focus on the}} Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to trigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral inhibition, i. e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling between neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic decisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e. g. ~as ones found in the regulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations, attributed to micro-environmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem. Our goal is to elucidate how the <b>induction</b> of extrinsic <b>noise</b> affects cell fate specification in a lateral inhibition mechanism. Using a stochastic Cellular Automaton with continuous state space, we show that extrinsic noise results in the emergence of steady-state furrow patterns of cells in a "frustrated/transient" phenotypic state...|$|R

When digital images are personal or confidential a high level security has to be provided. Traditional Encryption which is normally used to disguise data making it unintelligible to unauthorized observers do not consider the inherent features of images and thus is {{not considered to be}} highly effective with regard to computational complexity and also the security level enforced on images. This paper presents a new concept for image scrambling by applying pixel permutation and pixel substitution on an image split into irregular trapezoidal grids. Pixel permutation is performed using Arnold’s 2 -D cat map which will disarray the pixels. Then substitution is performed employing a distinctive feature that the key for substitution process for pixels are derived from the properties of the trapezoidal grid to which the pixel belongs. Thus pixels mapped to various grids will have different <b>noise</b> <b>induction</b> thus providing high level security. The entire process of pixel permutation and substitution is repeated for several iterations to provide higher level security. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully scramble the images, and the security analysis of the algorithm also demonstrates that the proposed scheme can withstand various cryptanalytic and statistical attacks...|$|R
