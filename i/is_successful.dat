40|$|One of the {{conclusions}} from the ongoing stream of PIMS research is that business strategies <b>are</b> <b>successful</b> if their fundamentals are good, unsuccessful {{if they are}} not. The implication <b>is</b> that <b>successful</b> strategies in a particular marketplace/economic environment will continue to <b>be</b> <b>successful</b> strategies in similar environments- even if competition is changed. The study presented here tests this conclusion in a business simulation competition and finds that successful strategies in one industry will, indeed, <b>be</b> <b>successful</b> in another...|$|R
30|$|One-size-fits-all {{policies}} for broadening {{participation in the}} STEMM workforce across skill-level are unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>successful.</b> Further, programs {{that are designed to}} generate wonder and fascination with STEMM content may <b>be</b> <b>successful</b> in attracting more girls. However, to promote greater participation of individuals from traditionally underrepresented ethnic minority groups in STEMM, programs that support choices toward higher educational attainment, specifically four-year college degree attainment, are more likely to <b>be</b> <b>successful.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it <b>is</b> <b>successful.</b> If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.|$|E
5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet <b>is</b> <b>successful.</b> The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis <b>is</b> <b>successful,</b> an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response <b>is</b> <b>successful</b> because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant <b>is</b> <b>successful</b> in {{maintaining}} their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E
