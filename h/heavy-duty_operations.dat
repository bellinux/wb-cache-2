The diesel-powered Jackaroo was available with a five-speed manual transmission and manual front hubs only coupled to a part-time four-wheel drive system with open front and limited slip rear differentials. The 3.2-liter V6 petrol engine version was also available with an optional four-speed automatic transmission with automatic locking front hubs. The same diesel engine was also available in the UK and other markets with a belt-driven overhead camshaft, which developed slightly more power. After 1998, {{and the introduction of}} the [...] "4JX1" [...] 3.0-liter diesel engine, a four-speed automatic transmission was made available in addition to the five-speed manual transmission.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the ongoing}} arms race against malware, {{antivirus}} software {{is at the}} forefront, {{as one of the}} most important defense tools in our arsenal. Antivirus software is flexible enough to be deployed from regular users desktops, to corporate e-mail proxies and file servers. Unfortunately, the signatures necessary to detect incoming malware number in the tens of thousands. To make matters worse, antivirus signatures are a lot longer than signatures in network intrusion detection systems. This leads to extremely high computation costs necessary to perform matching of suspicious data against those signatures. In this paper, we present GrAVity, a massively parallel antivirus engine. Our engine utilized the compute power of modern graphics processors, that contain hundreds of hardware microprocessors. We have modified ClamAV, the most popular open source antivirus software, to utilize our engine. Our prototype implementation has achieved end-to-end throughput in the order of 20 Gbits/s, 100 times the performance of the CPUonly ClamAV, while almost completely offloading the CPU, leaving it free to complete other tasks. Our micro-benchmarks have measured our engine to be able to sustain throughput in the order of 40 Gbits/s. The results suggest that modern graphics cards can be used effectively to perform <b>heavy-duty</b> anti-malware <b>operations</b> at speeds that cannot be matched by traditional CPU based techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Fuel used {{by heavy}} duty trucks {{is a major}} cost for {{logistics}} companies, and therefore improvements {{in this area are}} highly desired. Many of the factors that influence fuel consumption, such as the road type, vehicle configuration or external environment, are difficult to influence. One of the most under-explored ways to lower the costs is training and incentivizing drivers. However, today it is difficult to measure driver performance in a comprehensive way outside of controlled, experimental setting. This paper proposes a machine learning methodology for quantifying and qualifying driver performance, with respect to fuel consumption, that is suitable for naturalistic driving situations. The approach is a knowledge-based feature extraction technique, constructing a normalizing fuel consumption value denoted Fuel under Predefined Conditions (FPC), which captures the effect of factors that are relevant but are not measured directly. The FPC, together with information available from truck sensors, is then compared against the actual fuel used on a given road segment, quantifying the effects associated with driver behavior or other variables of interest. We show that raw fuel consumption is a biased measure of driver performance, being heavily influenced by other factors such as high load or adversary weather conditions, and that using FPC leads to more accurate results. In this paper we also show evaluation the proposed method using large-scale, real-world, naturalistic database of <b>heavy-duty</b> vehicle <b>operation...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} for achieving reliable, built-in, high-accuracy force sensing for legged robots is presented, based on direct {{exploitation of the}} properties of a robot's mechanical structure. The proposed methodology relies on taking account of force-sensing requirements at the robot design stage, {{with a view to}} embedding force-sensing capability within the mechanical structure of the robot itself. The test case is ROBOCLIMBER, a bulky, quadruped climbing and walking machine whose weighty legs enable it to carry out <b>heavy-duty</b> drilling <b>operations.</b> The paper shows that, with finite-element analysis of ROBOCLIMBER's mechanical configuration during the design stage, candidate positions can be selected for the placement of force transducers to measure indirectly the contact forces between the feet and the ground. Force sensors are then installed at the theoretically best positions on the mechanical structure, and several experiments are carried out to calibrate all sensors within their operational range of interest. After calibration, the built-in sensors are subjected to experimental performance evaluation, and the final best sensor option is found. The built-in force-sensing capability thus implemented is subjected to its first test of usability when it is employed to compute the actual centre of gravity of ROBOCLIMBER. The method is shown to be useful for determining variation during a gait (due to the non-negligible weight of the legs). Afterwards the force sensors are shown to be useful for controlling foot-ground interaction, and several illustrative experiments confirm the high sensitivity, reliability and accuracy of the selected approach. Lastly, the built-in sensors are used to measure ground-reaction forces and to compute the zero-moment point for ROBOCLIMBER in real time, both while standing and while executing a dynamically balanced gait. © 2006 SAGE Publication.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present a {{critical}} assessment of the current state-of-the-art of alternative fuel technologies for heavy-duty transit vehicles. Fuels considered include compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), methanol, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), hydrogen, and several advanced battery and fuel cell technologies. For each fuel type, results from the recent literature are collected to allow comparison of the combustion methods, emissions, power output, fuel efficiency, range, refueling requirements, development status, safety aspects, and infrastructure requirements of various engine designs. Since many of the engines are under various stages of development, data for {{operation and maintenance costs}} are somewhat scarce; however, such information is provided when possible. Short descriptions of problems remaining to be solved are given, but detailed comparisons between technologies are withheld until the Discussion and Comparison section in order to avoid biasing the initial presentations. The economic implications of the various strategies are then discussed in relation to the technical performance. Since the viability of <b>heavy-duty</b> vehicle <b>operation</b> depends to large extent on future emissions standards as well as the widespread availability of the given fuel, current and proposed emissions standards are listed, along with trends in light-duty and stationary applications involving the various fuels. Most of the work to date has centered on conversion and/or optimization of existing engine designs to accommodate the new fuels rather than the development of completely new engine concepts. Estimates of the capital cost and fuel economy of the various designs have been made, and the feasibility of retrofits versus dedicated engines are presented. The latter is especially important when one considers that poorly optimized retrofits may result in substantially higher emissions and maintenance costs than the original engines. A relative cost/benefit scale is formulated and used to rate the technologies, and the importance of the relative weighting factors in determining the outcome is discussed.

40|$|Most {{heavy-duty}} {{engines are}} diesel operated. Severe emission regulations, high fuel prices, high technology costs (e. g. catalysts, fuel injection systems) and unsustainably in supplying fuel are enough reasons to convenience engine developers to explore alternative technologies or fuels. Using natural gas/biogas {{can be a}} very good alternative due to the attractive fuel properties regarding emission reduction and engine <b>operation.</b> <b>Heavy-duty</b> diesel engines can be easily converted for natural gas operation which is a very cost effective process for producing gas engines. However, due to the high throttle losses and low expansion ratio the overall engine efficiency is lower than the corresponding diesel engines. Moreover the lower density of natural gas results in lower maximum power level. In this thesis key features and strategies which may result in improved efficiency, increased maximum power and improved transient capability of a heavy-duty natural gas engines have been identified, validated and suggested. High EGR rates combined with turbocharging has been identified as a promising way to increase the maximum load and efficiency of heavy-duty gas engines. With stoichiometric conditions a three way catalyst can be used and thus regulated emissions can be kept at very low levels. Obtaining reliable spark ignition is difficult however with high dilution {{and there will be a}} limit to the amount of EGR that can be tolerated for each operating point. Extending the dilution limit of the engine and developing closed-loop control to operate the engine at its dilution limit has been the main method to reduce throttle losses. A new method for calculating cyclic variation was developed that significantly improved the transient capability of the engine control system. The method consequently applied on a closed-loop dilution limit control. Only applying closed-loop control to operate the engine at its dilution limit resulted in at least 4. 5 % improvement in specific fuel consumption at 1200 RPM. The dilution limit can also be extended by replacing the combustion chambers with high turbulence pistons which enhances the combustion. By extending the dilution limit the gain in efficiency will be even higher. In summary the key features to improve the performance of a stoichiometrically operated natural gas engine are identified as: right amount of EGR at different operating regions, right compression ratio, Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT), high turbulence pistons, long route EGR system and model-based control...|$|R
