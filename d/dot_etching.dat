50|$|The {{compound}} has {{widespread use}} in blueprint drawing and in photography (Cyanotype process). Several photographic print toning processes involve {{the use of}} potassium ferricyanide. Potassium ferricyanide is used as an oxidizing agent to remove silver from negatives and positives, a process called <b>dot</b> <b>etching.</b> In color photography, potassium ferricyanide is used {{to reduce the size}} of color dots without reducing their number, as a kind of manual color correction. It is also used in black-and-white photography with sodium thiosulfate (hypo) to reduce the density of a negative or gelatin silver print where the mixture is known as Farmer's reducer; this can help offset problems from overexposure of the negative, or brighten the highlights in the print.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} a method of color evaluation which can be used by the customer when reviewing color proofs. The method being proposed here incorporates the use of color compensating (CC) filters when evaluating proofs where an overall color correction is necessary. The color balance among pictures that are to appear in close proximity to each other is a major consideration in publication printing as well as certain aspects of commercial printing. There is a need for an effective means of obtaining good reproductions of individual subjects while maintaining a visual consistency between them. In such cases a deliberate departure from normal color balance for a particular image may be desired. By using CC filtration, the customer is able to evaluate a proof and specify the changes in color balance by physical means. However, once a filter is specified as giving the desired visual effect, it must be quantified as to how much and what kind of changes on film are necessary to achieve the correct result. This study attempted to determine if it was possible to quantify filter selections by means of dry <b>dot</b> <b>etching.</b> Manipulations in color balance on film were made to three levels of dot change in an increasing direction and three levels of change in a decreasing direction. These six levels (A, B, C, -A, -B, -C) were made in the cyan printer of one separation, the magenta of another, and the yellow printer of a third. This gave a total of eighteen samples being produced. The dot size changes were accomplished by dry <b>dot</b> <b>etching</b> overall with the assistance of the Kodak Dry <b>Dot</b> <b>Etching</b> System. A panel of judges was used to determine whether or not there is a correlation between CC filtration and the amount of dot change made to a separation in order to achieve the desired visual match between the reference proof and the sample proof. The judges were given the reference proof and one sample at a time to view. The panel attempted to make a visual match in one of two ways: to choose a filter that would allow the reference proof to match the altered proof, or to choose a filter to remove the color cast from the altered proof in order to match the reference proof. The evaluation procedure was followed for all eighteen samples. The correlation coefficients were calculated for each of the three colors changed. The correlation proved to be quite high thereby substantiating the objectives of the filter evaluation method. However upon calculating and plotting the standard deviations of the judges 2 ̆ 7 results, the filter evaluation method proved to be useful when correcting overall color balance only within a certain amount of dot change. The objective of this method was to apply the filter evaluation technique in order to minimize the trial and error approach involved in making color corrections. When applied, this method could result in less waste of labor and materials which in turn results in higher productivity. In the end the separation/correction procedure becomes more cost effective...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the effects of dry etching techniques on changing halftone dotsizes. Dry etching, or photographic color correction, has emerged in recent years as an alternative to traditional <b>dot</b> <b>etching</b> for making local corrections to color separation halftones. This study examines six factors related to dry etching. First, three types of original halftone dots were considered: laser formed (hard) dots from a Hell DC- 300 B scanner, laser formed (semi-hard) dots from a P. D. I, scanner, and contact screen (soft) dots from a Crosfield 510 Magnascan scanner. Second, the original dot-sizes being treated were fixed {{as close as possible to}} five target dot-sizes (5 $, 25 $, 50 $, 75 $, and 95 $). Third, three types of dry etching treat ments were applied a technique of overexposure; the use of a 4 -mil clear spacer film; and a technique of exposing through the base. Fourth, sixteen levels of corrective treatment were applied ranging from 1 times dot-for-dot exposure to 100 times. Fifth, two types of graphic arts films were test ed lith film and rapid access. Sixth, two generations of contact printing were compared original positive-to-inter mediate negative and intermediate negative-to-duplicate positive...|$|E
30|$|In this study, TiO 2 micro-flowers {{composed}} of nanotubes were fabricated {{by means of}} <b>dot</b> patterning, Ti <b>etching,</b> and anodizing methods. The <b>dot</b> patterning and <b>etching</b> of Ti substrates increased the anodizing area to form TiO 2 nanotubes. By controlling the anodizing time, beautiful TiO 2 micro-flowers were successfully made to bloom on Ti substrates and were applied to the photoelectrodes of DSCs. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first study to report the fabrication of TiO 2 micro-flowers and their application to DSCs. The TiO 2 micro-flower structure is strongly expected to enhance the possibility to overcome the limitations of the TiO 2 nanoparticle structure.|$|R

An array of aluminium dots is evaporated through a stencil mask {{on top of an}} epitaxial BiFeO 3 thin film. Low energy focused ion beam milling of an area several microns wide containing the array-covered film leads to removal of the bismuth ferrite in between the aluminium-masked <b>dots.</b> By chemical <b>etching</b> of the remaining aluminium, nanoscale epitaxial bismuth ferrite islands with diameter ∼ 250 [*]nm were obtained.

40|$|We {{fabricated}} GaAs/AlGaAs {{quantum dots}} by droplet epitaxy method, and obtained the geometries of the dots from scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} data. Post-thermal annealing is essential for the optical activation of quantum dots grown by droplet epitaxy. We investigated the emission energy shifts of the dots and underlying superlattice by post-thermal annealing with photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements, and specified the emissions from the <b>dots</b> by selectively <b>etching</b> the structure down to a lower layer of quantum dots. We studied the influences of the degree of annealing on the optical properties of the dots from the peak shifts of the superlattice, which has the same composition as the dots, since the superlattice has uniform and well-defined geometry. Theoretical analysis provided the diffusion length dependence of the peak shifts of the emission spectra...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} stipple {{engraving}} {{is described in}} T.H. Fielding's Art of Engraving (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small <b>dots</b> with an <b>etching</b> needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in mezzotint use was made of roulettes, and a mattoir to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly. [...] Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a drypoint or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as [...] "resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.|$|R
