40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to research on characteristics of geometrically non-linear buckling behaviour of double layer latticed spherical domes by means of modal analysis. Modal analysis is applied to derivation of the system matrices of simultaneous differential equations representing the displacements by linear combination of several <b>eigen</b> <b>modes</b> which are independent and orthogonal each other and transforming variables into generalized coordinates which are coefficients multiplied to <b>eigen</b> <b>modes.</b> These <b>eigen</b> <b>modes</b> were calculated from the global system matrices. By using modal analysis method in the buckling analysis of double layer latticed domes, it will be expected to reduce the large dimension stiffness matrices of 3 -dimensional displacement variables of global systems to the small things of generalized coordinates extremely. The merit of use of modal analysis, moreover, is to avoid the degeneration of system matrices in multi degrees on bifurcation points. We can decrease the possiblity of divergence in the procedure of numerical calculation. It is, therefore, very effective to determine the direction of post-buckling path on the bifurcation points. Arc length method and Newton-Raphson iteration method is used to obtain the geometrically non-linear equilibrium path.

This research aims to determine the dominant patterns of variation of Bangkalan’s shoreline change, expressed by Eigen-function in empirical orthogonal function (EOF) models. That was started with data collection such as oceanographic data (wave and tidal), bathymetry and topographic map and sediment data. All data was used for forecasting two-monthly shoreline. Coordinate of two-monthly shoreline was used as input of EOF model. The first <b>Eigen</b> <b>mode</b> is a profile of shoreline equilibrium. The second <b>Eigen</b> <b>mode</b> shows pivot point that separates the different behaviors, which indicates a positive balance of shoreline from the direction of the dominant force.

40|$|An LDRD funded {{approach}} to development of reduced order models for systems with local nonlinearities is presented. This method is particularly useful for problems of structural dynamics, but has potential application in other fields. The {{key elements of}} this approach are (1) employment of <b>eigen</b> <b>modes</b> of a reference linear system, (2) incorporation of basis functions with an appropriate discontinuity {{at the location of}} the nonlinearity. Galerkin solution using the above combination of basis functions appears to capture the dynamics of the system with a small basis set. For problems involving small amplitude dynamics, the addition of discontinuous (joint) modes appears to capture the nonlinear mechanics correctly while preserving the modal form of the predictions. For problems involving large amplitude dynamics of realistic joint models (macro-slip), the use of appropriate joint modes along with sufficient basis <b>eigen</b> <b>modes</b> to capture the frequencies of the system greatly enhances convergence, though the modal nature the result is lost. Also observed is that when joint modes are used in conjunction with a small number of elastic <b>eigen</b> <b>modes</b> in problems of macro-slip of realistic joint models, the resulting predictions are very {{similar to those of the}} full solution when seen through a low pass filter. This has significance both in terms of greatly reducing the number of degrees of freedom of the problem and in terms of facilitating the use of much larger time steps...|$|R
