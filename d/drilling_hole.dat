30|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of phenolic resin was impregnated through <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in wood, and we manufactured compressed wood with the deformation fixed by the phenolic resin. The methods of impregnation {{used in this}} study were an in-liquid platen-pressing method and a vacuum treatment. The effect of the <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> on solution retention was examined. Moreover, the control of solution retention was examined under the application of compression drying. The impregnation of resin into the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> was insufficient, and the deformation could not be fixed. On the other hand, sufficient impregnation was possible in the specimen with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes,</b> and the deformation fixation was observed. At the stage of compression when the solution was squeezed out of the specimen, the solution retention of each specimen was accurately controlled in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b> At the stage of compressive deformation and deformation fixation using a hot press, the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> could not be processed normally because swelling occurred. However, swelling did not occur in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R

40|$|While <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> it is {{extremely}} important that the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> are <b>drilled</b> as straight as possible. Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. <b>Drill</b> <b>hole</b> deviation is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ). In the first drift, the production <b>holes</b> were <b>drilled</b> with a 115 mm drill bit, and in the second a drill bit of 105 mm. This is based on a project “Klenare borrhål” initiated by LKAB Wassara, a subsidiary of LKAB. LKAB Wassara wished to evaluate a possible reduction of <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> diameter from the current 115 mm, to 105 mm. If the project had positive outcome, further attempts with an even smaller borehole diameter of 89 mm would be tested. There will also be curvature measurements as part of the evaluation of Wassaras new drill hammer, W 90. The results of the measurements show that the average deviation of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a larger diameter drill bit had much higher deviation than for the smaller diameter <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> with a smaller drill bit...|$|R

An exploratory <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and {{the bottom of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations are part of an important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> at Yucca Mountain.
