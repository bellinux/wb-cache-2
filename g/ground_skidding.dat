40|$|Economic {{implications}} of soil disturbance {{are discussed in}} four categories: planning and layout,selection of harvesting systems and equipment, long-term site productivity loss, and rehabilitation treatments.

Alternative harvesting practices that are designed to minimize impacts on soils, such as use of designated skid trails and wide trail-spacing, increase overall harvesting costs.

Implementing the reduced impact monocable winch and planning of good skid trails {{should have a}} positive impact on work efficiency as well as, reducing damage to the residual stand and soil during felling and skidding activities. Reduced impact logging (RIL) with a monocable winch (Pancang Tarik) system has been tried in several IUPHHKs and it can be concluded that RIL monocable winch system could be applied practically and reduce impact on residual stand and soil damage. Using this technology has many advantages, among others: cost efficiency, locally made, environmental friendly, and high local community participation.

40|$|Ground based harvesting, or <b>ground</b> <b>skidding,</b> {{is still}} an {{acceptable}} harvesting method on gentler slopes and on less sensitive soils. Skid road rehabilitation {{is a relatively new}} treatment; for excavated and bladed trails, rehabilitation became a requirement on many sites under the 1995 Forest Practices Code. It will be required on all sites by June 15, 1998. In order to evaluate how trees have been growing on skidroad rehab, we have sampled sites in the east and west Kootenay that are as old as 1984. These sites are growing trees, and with improved techniques, applied to the least sensitive sites, we don't see any problems restoring soil productivity. More sensitive sites still need more study at this time. Successful skid road rehabilitation starts with a good understanding of the site condition and management constraints. Proper construction is key. Removal of woody debris and outsloping decompaction will ensure drainage restoration, along with regularly spaced, open waterbars. Replacing soil horizons in reverse order with minimal mixing will help restore topsoil, which is then protected and augmented with woody debris and slash loading similar to the surrounding area...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based logging {{typically}} produces well-defined skid trails on {{the forest}} floor during log extraction. With conventional logging, these skid trails cover from 18 to 36 percent of the soil surface after a single harvest entry (Dyrness 1965; Froehlich 1976). Subsequent entries can increase the area in skid trails to as much as 80 percent of the soil surface. The soil in the skid trails is almost always compacted. Increases in soil density during skidding generally range from 10 to 80 percent (Foil and Ralston 1967; Froehlich 1979), depending on soil strength, moisture content, organic matter, and machine variables such as ground pressure and vibration. Logging over frozen ground or a heavy cover of snow or slash can moderate or eliminate soil compaction (Froehlich 1978). In most areas, however, timber harvesting cannot always be scheduled to take advantage of those protective conditions; thus, soil compaction usually accompanies log skidding. Soil compaction alters soil structure to a condition usually less favorable to plant growth. The increase in soil density is accompanied by a decrease in pore space, which in turn reduces air exchange, water infiltration, and permeability. The increase in soil density also produces an increase In soil strength, which retards tree root extension. Soil compaction reduces the height growth of seedlings of several coniferous species by 10 to 50 percent (Foil and Ralston 1967; Froehlich 1979). Stem volume may be affected more severely than height growth. In a study with 16 -year-old ponderosa pine, - soil compaction decreased height growth by 29 percent and stem growth by 68 percent (Froehlich 1979). Similarly, soil compaction reduced height growth of 26 -year-old loblolly pine by 13 percent and stem volume growth by 53 percent (Perry 1964). The growth reduction of individual trees apparently is related to the amount of root zone compacted and the percentage of Increase in soil density (Froehlich 1979; Perry 1964). Therefore, the impact of skid trails on tree growth in a given tract will depend on the amount of area in skid trails or the number of trees affected and on the relative increase in soil density in the skid trails. Some forest managers have turned to skyline or even helicopter logging as a means of reducing site impacts from timber harvesting. These systems spare the soil but are at least twice as expensive as <b>ground</b> <b>skidding</b> with logging vehicles on gently sloping terrain (Aulerich et al. 1974).

40|$|Skidding {{by means}} of heavy {{forestry}} machinery can affect soil physical properties. We assessed the effects of <b>ground</b> based <b>skidding</b> on soil bulk density and total porosity under the Iranian mountainous forest conditions. Treatments included a combination of four levels of traffic intensity (1, 3, 6, and 15 passes) of a Timberjack 450 C rubber skidder and two levels of slope (20 %). The bulk density was highest in samples taken in the wheel tracks and between them, and decreased towards {{both ends of the}} track (0. 5 to 4 m). The results showed that bulk density increased with traffic frequency, while total porosity decreased. Average soil bulk density ranged from 0. 96 g cm- 3 (after one machine pass and slope 20 %) on the skid trail, while the respective value was 0. 7 g cm– 3 for the undisturbed area. On compacted soil, total porosity at the 0 – 10 cm depth decreased by 37 % compared with non-compacted soil. The results showed that slope steepness had a strong effect on the soil disturbance, with the critical value for bulk density occurring after 15 machine passes at slope 20 %. The impacts of soil compaction could be evidenced in a distance of up to 2 m {{from the end of the}} skidding trail. The latter finding suggests that special interest in the form of managerial measures should be taken during the skidding operations in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of <b>ground</b> based <b>skidding</b> on the physical properties of the soil...|$|R

40|$|In Turkey {{ground base}} {{skidding}} method is frequently used to extract log material. Physical damages occurring on the skidded log during ground based skidding cause {{quality and quantity}} loss of the log. This damage is formed by the ground structure, mass of transported logs, friction coefficient and skidding distance. In this study to improve a »Damage Prediction Model« means to predict the quantity loss that can occur {{as a result of}} <b>ground</b> <b>skidding</b> on steep areas. Spruce forests in Maçka, Trabzon, Eastern Blacksea, was selected as the study area. The slope of study area ranged between 45 % and 80 %. In this context, a total of 318 logs were researched. These logs were skidded in 6 harvested areas where skidding is done both in summer and winter. It was determined during research that the types of damage causing quantity loss are breakage and wood wearing out. In the meantime, the quantity loss occurring as a result of breakage and wood wearing out was calculated as volume. Aprediction model was developed by taking into consideration friction vector affecting skidded log, friction surface area of the log and skidding distance parameters. The model was developed based on data related to logs skidded in summer and winter. Damage prediction model coefficients were obtained for two production seasons by solving models according to the least squares method. Statistical significance of coefficients was done and damage prediction models were obtained with significant coefficients for summer and winter production seasons. This enabled producers to predict the quantity loss before skidding and to take necessary precautions...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This study compares {{production}} {{rates and}} costs for four <b>ground</b> <b>skidding</b> machines and for four harvesting treatments. The four machine types studied were a Caterpillar 060 crawler (060), Caterpillar 518 rubber tired skidder (RTS), FMC 200 CA (FMC), and International TD- 8 E crawler (TD- 8 E). Two treatments, conventional/whole tree and designated/tree length, were studied, and two, Conventional/tree length and designated/whole tree, were determined through {{the regression analysis}} and statistical inference. Conventional versus designated refers to skid road location and restriction to, while whole tree versus tree length refers to whether the skidded trees contained limbs and tops or not. The study took place in northern Idaho. The stand was two-storied and the overstory was removed to release the advanced understory. The overstory averaged s trees per acre and contained 23. 0 cunits (gross) per acre. Two operators were time studied {{for each of the}} four machine types to help eliminate operator influence and produce more meaningful comparisons. Eight operators, 483 hours of detailed time study, and 2, 270 cunits skidded allowed for many delays and all significant variables to be averaged over machine types and treatments. Regression analysis was used to develop equations to predict delay free elemental times. Indicator variables were employed to determine significant differences between conventional and designated skid roads and between whole tree and tree length skidding. In addition, significance was determined between independent variables. Delay free turn time was calculated by summing the predicted elemental times. At an average residual skidding distance of 530 feet, the study average, dollars per cunit for conventional/whole tree were calculated to be: D 6 D, 27. 60; RTS, 19. 00; FMC, 36. 30; TD- 8 E, 27. 70 and for designated/tree length: D 60, 27. 10; RTS, 21. 50; FMC, 31. 40; TD- 8 E, 29. 30. For all skidding distances and both studied treatments, the RTS was the most economical machine type. The FMC was the most expensive, and this is attributed to the low observed mechanical availability and high operating costs. The D 6 Dand TD- 8 E were midway in costs. Lower initial and operating costs made the TD- 8 E more economical than the D 6 D for distances less than 500 feet for conventional/whole tree and for distances less than 275 feet for designated/tree length. Designated/tree length was more economical than conventional/whole tree for the D 6 D and FMC but not for the RTS and TD- 8 E. The main reason was that a significant increase in pieces per turn for the D 6 D and FMC offset the additional sawyer costs required to produce the tree length pieces. The RTS and TD- 8 E showed no increase in pieces per turn. Just the restriction to skid roads (designated/whole tree versus conventional/whole tree) is expected to influence costs per cunit by: 060, + 0. 40; RTS, + 0. 40; FMC, - 0. 50; TD- 8 E, + 0. 20. Mortality and damage to the advanced regeneration was shown to be related to machine impact (visual signs of machine activity within an 1 / 200 th acre plot). Plots not impacted by the machine (timber impacted) averaged 37 percent mortality and damage. Plots that were machine impacted averaged 84 to 91 percent mortality and damage. The conventional/whole tree units averaged 34 percent machine impacted plots, and designated/tree length averaged 21 percent. Overall impact, mortality and damage, averaged 54 percent for the conventional units and 46 percent for the designated units. The eight percent difference was primarily mortality rather than damage. Percent of area in skid roads was calculated using parameters collected during the damage study and assuming an average skid road width of 10 feet. For all machine types, 17 percent of the conventional units and nine percent of the designated units were calculated to be roaded...|$|E
40|$|Increasing productivity, {{reducing}} cost, reducing soil damage, {{reducing the}} impact of harvesting on standing tree and regeneration are all very important objectives in <b>ground</b> <b>skidding</b> system {{in the management of}} the Hyrcanian forest. The research carried out to obtain these objectives included four logging methods, tree length method (TLM), long length method (LLM), short length method (SLM), and wood extraction by mule (mule) in northern Iran. In order to determine the cost per unit, time study techniques were used for each harvesting method, time study data are shifted to logarithmic data based on 10. On the basis of the developed models simulated, 11 skidding turns are simulated and the unit cost are estimated depending on the diameter of the log (DL), skidding distance (SD), and the winching distance (WD) for 11 different cycles with TLM, LLM and SLM. The results showed that on average, the net costs per extraction of one cubic meter of wood were 3. 06, 5. 69, 6. 81 and 34. 36 €/m 3 in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The costs depending on diameter of log (DL), skidding distance (SD) and winching distance (WD) showed that the most economical alternative for Northern Iran is TLM. In the cut-to-length system, the costs of both alternatives LLM, SLM were significantly dependent on DL., thus the result of this study suggests {{that as long as the}} diameter of the felled trees is less than 40 cm, the cut-to-length system is not an economical alternative, whilst the cut-to-length method can be applied for trees with a diameter more than 40 cm. Where diameters are more than 40 cm TLM it is more economical than SLM, however it was not significantly different. Depending on SD in short skidding distance SLM is preferable to LLM but in cases of long skidding distance LLM is more economical than SLM. The winching distance affect was not a factor on cost. To assess the damage on seedlings and standing trees a 100 % inventory method was employed in pre-hauling and post-hauling, alongside of skidding trails, winching strips and mule hauling with a 12 m width. To chose the best alternative depending on standing damage the Analysis of multiple criterial approval (MA) was applied. The amount of trees damaged by winching operation were 11. 89 % in TLM, 14. 44 % in LLM 27. 59 %, SLM and 0 stem and by skidding operation were 16. 73 %, 3. 13 % and 8. 78 % of total trees in TLM, LLM and SLM. In the winching area about 14 %, 20 %, 21 % and 6 % of the total regeneration was damaged by TLM, LLM, SLM and mule and the skidding operation damaged 7. 5 % in TLM, 7. 4 % LLM and 9. 4 % in SLM. The friendliest alternative to residual standing was mule but in manual method (where the wood extraction is done by skidder) MA showed that the best alternative depending on residual damage is LLM. To determine the degree of soil compaction a core sampling technique of bulk density was used. Soil samples collected from the horizontal face of a soil pit at 10 cm depth soil core, at 50 m intervals on skid trials, in winching strips and control are (no vehicles pass) a soil sample was taken at 10 m intervals in the hauling direction of the mule. In order to determine the post-harvesting extent of disturbance on skidding trails by skidding operations, the disturbed widths were measured at 50 m intervals along the skid trails. In the winching area, where the winched logs created a streak of displaced soil, the width of the displaced streak was measured at 5 m interval along the winching strip. In mule hauling operations the width of a streak created by a mule foot track was measured at 10 m intervals. To compare increased average bulk density between alternatives one way The ANOVA, Duncan test and Dunnett t-test with a 95 % confidence level were used. A General linear model was applied to relate the increasing bulk density and the slope gradient. To realize the correlation between the increment of soil bulk density and the slope gradient and the correlation between the soil compaction and soil moisture content (%) The Pearson correlation test was applied. To choose the best alternative (in manual method) a MA test was applied again. The bulk density on the skidding trail increased 51 % for 30 skidding turn, 35 % for 31 skidding turn (one unloaded and one loaded pass) and 46 % for 41 skidding turn. Results of ANOVA (p < 0. 05) show significant differences of bulk density between alternatives. Duncan test and the Dunnett t-test indicated that the increasing soil bulk density was not significant between control samples and winching strip of TLM and extraction by mule samples. The general linear modeling and Pearson correlation test results indicated that the slope gradient had an insignificant effect on soil compaction, whilst the Pearson test indicates a medium negative correlation between soil compaction and percentage of soil moisture. By ground-based winching operation 0. 07 %, 0. 03 %, 0. 05 % and 0. 002 % of the total area and by ground based skidding operation 1. 21 %, 1. 67 %, 0. 81 % and 0. 00 % of total area was disturbed and compacted in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The Pearson correlation results show that the width of disturbed area was significantly influenced by the diameter of logs and length of logs (p ˂ 0. 05), but there is no significant correlation between soil disturbance width and slope. The results of analysis of MA showed that soil compaction was not related to logging method but sensitivity analysis of MA shows that LLM and TLM are both preferable to SLM...|$|E

There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord, roughly rectangular, warping tailplane was mounted just below the upper girder member. Above it and instead of the earlier rectangular rudders there was a pair of small triangular fins, each mounting a broad rudder with a gently rounded leading edges and a straight, vertical trailing edge. The fins were separated by about one third of the tailplane span.|$|R

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} scaling, particularly when high-value logs are involved, is the 'roll out' method. In this process, the logs are unloaded {{from the truck}} and rolled out on the <b>ground</b> or on <b>skids</b> a single layer deep, so that the scaler can then see {{a good part of}} every log in order to assist in determining the number and size of defects such as bend or rot. Rollout scaling must be done where heavy machinery is available to handle the logs, and requires the space to do the rollout as well as the time and expense of the extra handling. Rollout scaling can be more efficient (at least for the trucks) as the trucks do not have to wait to be scaled and can be unloaded and leave immediately. This is in contrast with the ramp scale, where the truck must wait until the scaling is complete.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{executed}} {{to determine the}} plant species of herbaceous cover in a skid road subjected to soil compaction due to timber skidding in a beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky.) stand. Our previous studies have shown that <b>ground</b> based timber <b>skidding</b> destroys the soils extremely, and degradations on ecosystem because of the timber skidding limit recovery and growth of plant cover on skid roads. However, some plant species show healthy habitat, recovery and they can survive after the extreme degradation in study area. We evaluated composition of these plant species and their cover-abundance scales in 100 m x 3 m transect. 15 plant species were determined belongs to 12 plant families and Liliaceae was the highest representative plant family. Smilax aspera L., Epimedium pubigerum (DC.) Moren et Decaisne, Carex distachya Desf. var. distachya Desf., Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn., Trachystemon orientalis (L.) G. Don, Hedera helix L. have the highest coverabundance scale overall of determined species on compacted skid road...|$|R
50|$|In 1996, {{a student}} of Niagara County Community College created a haunted house in the mansion. Psychics have long called the {{building}} haunted. The Van Horn Mansion {{is one of several}} haunted locations in Niagara County and Western New York. During renovations roofers witnessed faces in windows of the vacant mansion and saw lights flicker for no reason. Carpenters saw spirits appear to them. The person who haunts the mansion is said to be Malinda with a few others. The grave of Malinda, wife of James Van Horn Jr, is located in the rose garden {{on the south side of}} the <b>grounds.</b> Cars have <b>skidded</b> to avoid hitting a girl running from the mansion who later vanishes. The girl is believed to be Malinda. People have held séances there, and have recounted other paranormal occurrences as well. The bones of Malinda have since been moved to a small area in the backyard of the mansion and no other paranormal encounters have been made.|$|R

Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members shortened the landing run. The wingspans of the Type E were 0.5 m greater than those of the Type C with an increase of the inner bay width which placed the booms further apart and increased the undercarriage track from 8 to 10 ft, making landings easier. There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord, roughly rectangular, warping tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide {{documentation}} of the completed corrective action and to provide data confirming the corrective action. The corrective action was performed {{in accordance with the}} approved Corrective Action Plan (CAP) (U. S. Department of Energy [DOE], 1999) and consisted of clean closure by excavation and disposal. The Area 15 Quonset Hut 15 - 11 was formerly used for storage of farm supplies including pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. The Area 23 Quonset Hut 800 was formerly used to clean pesticide and herbicide equipment. Steam-cleaning rinsate and sink drainage occasionally overflowed a sump into adjoining drainage ditches. One ditch flows south and {{is referred to as the}} quonset hut ditch. The other ditch flows southeast and is referred to as the inner drainage ditch. The Area 23 Skid Huts were formerly used for storing and mixing pesticide and herbicide solutions. Excess solutions were released directly to the <b>ground</b> near the <b>skid</b> huts. The skid huts were moved to a nearby location prior to the site characterization performed in 1998 and reported in the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) (DOE, 1998). The vicinity and site plans of the Area 23 sites are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively...|$|R
40|$|At least 200, 000 m 3 {{of timber}} are {{harvested}} annually using semi-mechanised harvesting systems (SMS) on the Viphya forest plantations in Malawi. Although these systems {{have long been}} used on the Viphya, no investigation on their productivity {{has so far been}} reported. The absence of local productivity models created uncertainty about the importance of sitebased factors that influence timber harvesting productivity of these systems on the Viphya. Secondly, there is paucity of information regarding the appropriate timber harvesting systems for production maximisation and cost minimisation. This study aimed to develop prediction models for estimating the productivity and costs of semi-mechanised and simulated mechanised timber harvesting systems on the Viphya forest plantations. The study was conducted in Pinus kesiya stands at Kalungulu and Champhoyo forest stations of the Viphya forest plantations. A work study approach was followed to capture harvesting time and volume data. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to develop felling time models for a chainsaw over tree size, inter-tree distance, slope, ground condition, brush density, and <b>ground</b> roughness; and <b>skidding</b> time models over distance, slope, ground condition, ground roughness and volume skidded per cycle for a grapple skidder. Models were statistically validated. Secondary work study data for semi-mechanised systems were simulated for mechanised productivity based on local site factors. The study had shown that diameter at breast height and inter-tree distance were important factors that best explained felling time prediction models in Pinus kesiya stands on the Viphya forest plantations. Similarly, distance from stump to the roadside landing was {{the most important factor in}} addition to volume load, slope and ground conditions that determined grapple skidding time. Mechanised systems appear to be more advantageous than semi-mechanised systems. The former are associated with lower operating costs and inventories with relatively high production rates. Therefore, mechanised systems could help to optimise timber harvesting productivity on the Viphya. Further studies should be conducted to determine the effect of different ground conditions and roughness on skidding productivity. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|We {{examined}} carbon export {{in whole}} logs and carbon accumulation as coarse woody debris (CWD) produced from forest damage during {{all phases of}} the first and second year of a certified reduced impact logging (RIL) timber harvest in southern Amazonia. Our measurements included a 100 % survey of roads and log decks, assessment of canopy damage and <b>ground</b> disturbance in <b>skid</b> trails and tree-fall gaps, and measurement of carbon exported from the site in logs. Log deck and road construction crushed one and five trees in the 10 – 60 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) class per hectare logged, disturbed areas of 24 and 100 m 2 ha− 1, respectively, and together disturbed about 1 % of the forest. On average 1. 1 – 2. 6 trees ha− 1 were harvested over the two years. Logged gaps constituted the greatest disturbance on an area basis (4 – 10 % of the forest) and CWD generation (1. 9 – 4. 4 Mg ha− 1 logged). In gaps, felled trees severed or crushed 10 trees ≥ 10 cm DBH per tree logged, which corresponded to 1. 7 Mg ha− 1 of CWD per tree logged. Crown height – measured from the first bifurcation {{to the top of the}} crown – rather than tree height was the better predictor of gap size formed from tree felling (R 2 = 0. 41). Logging activities significantly reduced leaf area in roads, log decks and gaps, with the greatest reduction (48 %) in log decks and least in logged gaps and roads (28 – 33 %) compared to undisturbed forest. A total of 37 species were harvested, with 36 % of the total trees harvested and 48 % of the total carbon exported from the site in three of the most common species. Logging damage produced 4. 9 – 8. 8 Mg C ha− 1 logged of CWD from all phases of the operation. Carbon export in whole logs (2. 1 – 3. 7 Mg C ha− 1 logged) represented 1 – 3 % of the total standing forest carbon ≥ 10 cm DBH (138 Mg C ha− 1). The mean carbon ratio (per hectare logged) of C in CWD to C exported in logs was 2. 4. The disturbance, damage, carbon export and CWD data we present advances understanding of the effect of selective logging on tropical forest dynamics of the Amazon Basin. Our results indicate that certified timber harvest in Amazonia under RIL is a viable forest management option to reduce damage and CWD production compared to conventional logging (CL) practices; however, the benefits of disturbance reduction from RIL relative to CL are only realized at greater volumes of timber extraction...|$|R
