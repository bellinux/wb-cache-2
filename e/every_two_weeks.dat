5|$|Harry met his wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the Jacaranda club—managed by Allan Williams, {{the first}} {{manager of the}} Beatles—and she later agreed to help him start a music newspaper. After {{borrowing}} £50, Harry released {{the first issue of}} Mersey Beat on 6 July 1961, with the first 5,000 copies selling out within a short time. The newspaper was published <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> covering the music scenes in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn.

5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, as he came to require them <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir. In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{returned}} from America in 1911 and resumed his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company's {{operations}} along the coast {{can be seen by}} their 1870 schedule, in which they were making the journey to Kiama, Shoalhaven and Gerringong every three days, and to Ulladulla, Clyde, Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate. Mourya was visited <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week. 1873 saw a simplification of these services, and a weekly run to Merimbula, Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes.|$|E

5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old; {{production}} of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months. However, successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months. Breeding takes place throughout the year. Oestrus, one to three days long, recurs <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> unless the female is pregnant. Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking, and form temporary pairs with males. Mating has not been extensively studied; limited number of observations suggest that copulation, that lasts nearly four minutes on an average, begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female, who rolls on the ground. Following this he approaches and mounts the female. The pair separate after copulation.|$|E

5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' {{headquarters}} in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally {{in the first}} season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} moving at a pace of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, the Presbyterian Church in Milton, Pennsylvania {{requested}} Waller's service, but he instead began preaching in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also preached in Wilkes-Barre and Lancaster in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton {{in early}} 1839. On May 1, 1839, he was ordained in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. His Presbyterian ministry began on a church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. When he began preaching, his ministry covered all of Columbia County, {{as well as}} an area from Danville to the Wyoming Valley. In 1840, he stopped preaching at Briar Creek and Berwick, as they became part of a separate ministry. In 1842, he began preaching in Orangeville and New Columbia. he preached in Espy since at least 1857. Due to the size of his ministry, he was never able to preach at a given church more than once <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> and only preached at most churches once a month. He typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. Initially his salary was $600.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, {{a friend}} from the Jacaranda, heard about Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia gave up her accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a desk, chair and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Erythropoietin {{which is}} a {{cytokine}} {{has been known for}} a long time as a hematopoietic hormone. Its effectiveness mechanism is to reduce apoptosis in cells making erythroblast in bone marrow. Its artificial form is available, too. The hormone is used to improve anemia in patients with renal failure. With regard to high rate of renal patients, high cost of renal treatment with erythropoietin, and unavailability of the drug versus easy availability of nandrolone even as an OTC combination in drugstores, we decided to study the coincident effects of both drugs for using nandrolone in place of erythropoietin in case of obtaining suitable results. For this purpose 24 Vistar male rats with weight of 200 - 250 gram were divided randomly in to four groups, each group consisted of 6 rats: the first group was Sham (6 Vistar male rats), the second one was control group in which vascular pedicles were blocked, the third group received 500 IU/kg peritoneally <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before ischemia via injection, the fourth group received 3 mg/kg nandrolone decanoate intramuscularly and 500 IU/kg peritoneally <b>every</b> <b>week,</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> before ischemia. The data were reported as mean+SEM. ANOVA statistical method was used for data analysis and Tokay comparative tests was used to compare the difference among groups. The rate of p< 0. 05 has been considered as a meaningful level among groups. The obtained results demonstrated that erythropoietin had a positive effect on renal function by itself and administration of the drug without nandrolone could decrease and improve degeneration of tubule cells, decrease the hyaline cast and decrease the necrosis of tubule cells.

5|$|The Family Edition, {{like the}} prior version, {{includes}} parental controls {{and the information}} filtering feature. Parental controls come {{with a list of}} objectionable sites, separated into 32 categories. The list is updated <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> by Norton LiveUpdate. Using the list alone, Norton only blocks sites present on the list. Consequently, Norton may not block sites until the next update. Parents can customize the list, adding or removing sites. A list of allowed sites can be created to restrict children to those specific sites. This version uses application blocking rather than protocol or port filtering to control Internet access. Children can be restricted in what applications they used to access the Internet. A parental controls profile can be set up for each child, and settings can be automatically configured based on their age group, whether they be a child, teenager, adult, or administrator. Internet usage and violations are noted in a report presented to parents. PC Magazine found that enabling parental controls added a minute to a computer's boot time.|$|E
5|$|The lay {{attendees}} at Tinh Xa Trung Tam {{are predominantly}} female by {{a ratio of}} around 5 to 1, {{and most of the}} temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly Bát Quan Trai Giới (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely. During the retreat day, meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once <b>every</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.|$|E
