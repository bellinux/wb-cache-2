40|$|Atom is an {{anonymous}} messaging system that protects against traffic-analysis attacks. Unlike many prior systems, each Atom server touches {{only a small}} fraction of the total messages routed through the network. As a result, the system's capacity scales near-linearly with the number of servers. At the same time, each Atom user benefits from "best possible" anonymity: a user is anonymous among all honest users of the system, against an active adversary who controls the entire network, a portion of the system's servers, and any number of malicious users. The architectural ideas behind Atom have been known in theory, but putting them into practice requires new techniques for (1) avoiding the reliance on heavy general-purpose multi-party computation protocols, (2) defeating active attacks by malicious servers at minimal performance cost, and (3) handling server failure and churn. Atom is most suitable for sending a large number of short messages, as in a microblogging application or a <b>high-security</b> <b>communication</b> bootstrapping ("dialing") for private messaging systems. We show that, on a heterogeneous network of 1, 024 servers, Atom can transit a million Tweet-length messages in 28 minutes. This is over 23 x faster than prior systems with similar privacy guarantees...|$|E

He was imprisoned in Orbe but not in the <b>high-security</b> area; a <b>communication</b> officer in the prison said, [...] "We were never told...that Poparic was a member of Pink Panther group" [...] and that had they known, he would have been kept in a different section.|$|R
50|$|Smartcards are {{probably}} the most widely deployed form of secure cryptoprocessor, although more complex and versatile secure cryptoprocessors are widely deployed in systems such as Automated teller machines, TV set-top boxes, military applications, and <b>high-security</b> portable <b>communication</b> equipment. Some secure cryptoprocessors can even run general-purpose operating systems such as Linux inside their security boundary. Cryptoprocessors input program instructions in encrypted form, decrypt the instructions to plain instructions which are then executed within the same cryptoprocessor chip where the decrypted instructions are inaccessibly stored. By never revealing the decrypted program instructions, the cryptoprocessor prevents tampering of programs by technicians who may have legitimate access to the sub-system data bus. This is known as bus encryption. Data processed by a cryptoprocessor is also frequently encrypted.|$|R
