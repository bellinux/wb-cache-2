5|$|Khrushchev {{was born}} in 1894 {{in the village of}} Kalinovka, which is close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was {{employed}} as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges, and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern Ukraine, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War (Eastern Front of World War II), Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the bloody defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both {{the old man and the}} young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

25|$|The Second Estate feared {{they would}} have to pay the tax {{replacing}} the suppressed Corvée.

They saw this elimination of tax privilege as the gateway for more attacks on their rights and urged Louis XVI throughout the Protests of the Parlement of Paris not to enact the proposed reforms.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle {{was educated}} in Paris at the Collège Stanislas and studied briefly in Belgium where he {{continued}} to display his interest in reading and studying history and shared the <b>great</b> <b>pride</b> many of his countrymen felt in their nation's achievements.
