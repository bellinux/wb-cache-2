50|$|The {{earliest}} known Anseriform is {{the recently}} discovered Vegavis, which lived during the Cretaceous period. It {{is thought that}} the Anseriformes originated when the original Galloanserae (the group to which Anseriformes and Galliformes belong) split into the two main lineages. The extinct dromornithids may possibly represent early offshoots of the anseriform line, if they aren't stem-Galliformes instead, and so maybe Gastornis (if it is an Anseriform). The ancestors of the Anseriformes developed the characteristic bill structure that they still share. The combination of the internal shape of the bill and a modified tongue acts as a suction pump to draw water in {{at the tip of}} the bill and expel it from the sides and rear; an array of <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> plates called lamellae traps small particles, which are then licked off and swallowed.|$|E

The liquid from the final settlement tanks is of sufficient quality that it can be discharged into Salmons Brook, from where it makes its way into the Lee Navigation. Before discharge, some of the water is passed through a tertiary treatment phase, where a <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> is used to remove residual fine particles. The woven mesh membrane must be washed periodically to remove any accumulated sediments.

A brickyard produced 80,000 high-quality bricks {{a day in the}} early part of the century, and they were sent principally to Victoria and Vancouver. The brickyard ceased functioning in the 1950s. In the 1890s and early twentieth century sandstone blocks were cut from a quarry near Descanso Bay and shipped for architectural use in public buildings in Vancouver and Victoria. In the early-to-mid-1930s, millstones were cut from the sandstone and sent to towns along the west coast and as far away as Finland for use in the pulp and paper industry. [...] A small diatomaceous earth industry also flourished in the 1930s. The product was used for many purposes including as a <b>fine</b> <b>filter,</b> a polishing agent, and as an abrasive.

After World War II, the shipyard at Silva Bay became the major employer on the island until the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the years}} the mining company Boliden Mineral AB have had {{difficulties}} producing a working <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> for their tailing pond at the Aitik copper mine. The problem with the <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> occurs when it gets placed on the tailing pond wall. Coarse grains break down into fine grains and the entire composition of the <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> is changed. The material {{that is used to}} produce the <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> comes from the mine’s own waste rock supply. The primary waste rock in Aitik comprises of heterogeneous gneiss and pegmatite. To determine why the waste rock isn’t holding together well enough the mechanical strength of the rock is investigated. Huge differences for the mechanical strength both exist between the different rock types, but also in the different kinds of the gneiss. The effect of the explosions, used to mine the ore, and the crushing machine also impacts on the mechanical strength of the rock. Good mechanical strength is found in rock that has a high amount of secondary transformation like epidote and bad mechanical strength from foliated rock. To get the best mechanical properties it is suggested to exploit epidote transformed rock found in deformation zones, adjacent to the ore deposit or the pegmatite intrusions. It is also recommended to use less powerful charge when blasting rock material that will be used for production of the <b>fine</b> <b>filter...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let T be {{the set of}} {{vertices}} of a tree. We {{assume that}} the Green function is finite and G(s, t) → 0 as |s | → ∞ for each vertex t. For v positive superharmonic on T and E a subset of T, the reduced function of v on E is the pointwise infimum of the set of positive superharmonic functions that majorize v on E. We give an explicit formula for the reduced function in case E is finite {{as well as several}} applications of this formula. We define the minimal <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> corresponding to each bound-ary point of the tree and prove a tree version of the Fatou-Näım-Doob limit theorem, which involves the existence of limits at boundary points following the minimal <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> of the quotient of a positive superhar-monic by a positive harmonic function. We deduce from this a radial limit theorem for such functions. We prove a growth result for positive superharmonic functions from which we deduce that, if the trees has transition probabilities all of which lie between δ and 1 / 2 − δ for some δ ∈ (0, 1 / 2) (for example homogeneous trees with isotropic transition probabilities), then any real-valued function on T which has a limit at a boundary point following the minimal <b>fine</b> <b>filter</b> necessarily has a non-tangential limit there.
