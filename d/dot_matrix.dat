The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer's memory.

Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{originated with}} a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a <b>dot</b> <b>matrix.</b> Naka's prototype was a platform {{game with a}} fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara. Yasuhara originally intended {{to work on the}} game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War, but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year. His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design. The game's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E

We could successfully extract and measure all distance spaces around and inside the coded <b>dots</b> <b>matrix</b> corresponding to each color laser printout of Xerox® samples. Furthermore, we have figured out that all color laser printout samples studied from the same and different Xerox® brand models had the tracking dots with a defined configuration spread onto the color laser printouts in a regular grid of dots (pattern) – as row and column arrangements. The defined configuration of the basic unit of the tracking <b>dots</b> <b>matrix</b> (pattern) corresponding to the color laser of Xerox® brand named with “the coded dots matrix” pattern. All studied coded <b>dots</b> <b>matrices</b> composed of fifteen columns and eight rows in a regular grid pattern with a unique distribution of yellow tracking dots inside their patterns. The coded <b>dots</b> <b>matrix</b> (CDM) patterns studied exhibited mainly information about the machine serial number and model. Furthermore, according to the variation in the model sizes of the color laser printers of Xerox® brand, we found not all the coded <b>dots</b> <b>matrix</b> patterns exhibited the time and date for the printing process, but all multifunction printers only exhibited this feature. Therefore, we have introduced a new method {{could be applied to}} distinguish between two or more color laser Xerox® printouts of the same model with different serial numbers, and different models in digital forensic labs – with an accuracy ratio reached to 100 %. This study is being a part of series studies that currently have been carrying out on different color laser brands.|$|R
30|$|The Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT) is a {{paper and}} pencil test {{consisting}} of five sections used {{as a measure of}} nonverbal fluency. Within each section, there are 35 <b>dot</b> <b>matrices</b> arranged in a 5 ″ ×  7 ″ pattern. The participants had 1  min to connect three or more dots, making as many unique patterns as possible in the time allotted. Scoring consists of counting the number of patterns minus the number of perseverative errors for each trial. The total score is the number of patterns produced minus the number of perseverative errors. A perseverative error consists of a repetition of a design. In accordance with previous research [21, 66], three sheets containing the 35 <b>dot</b> <b>matrices</b> instead of five sheets were used to maintain uniformity with the COWAT.

40|$|Abstract: Segmented {{representation}} {{is used in}} lieu of the <b>dot</b> <b>matrices</b> representation for alphanumeric characters of different languages. Due to concerns of cost, power loss and design complexity, the segmented representation becomes more popular over the <b>dot</b> <b>matrices.</b> There are very limited display units for English, Arabic, and Bangla alphanumeric characters. 18 -segments display is normally used to display the entire alphabetic character of English. But there is no standard display unit for Bangla Alphabetic Characters. Although recently different segmented display models for Bangla characters have been proposed, the quality of the characters stay below the mark. In this paper, 26 -segments display for Bangla alphabetic character has been proposed. From the review it appears that it is the first proposed display in the world for Bangla Alphabetic Character. Here a grid structure consisting of 26 segments has been discovered. All Bangla characters vowel and consonants can be characterized by using this grid structure. As there can be at least vowels (12), consonants (39), punctuation, and some other symbols to be displayed, 6 -bit inputs are used to represent each character. After analyzing which segments will be activated for which character, appropriate logic function and circuits have been derived in order to display each Bangla character. Finally, a comparative analysis is made among the different proposed segmented display models to find out the cost and effectiveness in terms of display quality, power loss, and design complexity...|$|R
