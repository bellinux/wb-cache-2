Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced <b>frontal</b> <b>sinus</b> found in living catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found in living catarrhines.

40|$|URL] The <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> play {{a highly}} {{relevant}} role in comparative human identification processes. Since forensic radiology is a branch in the forensic sciences, adequate radiological {{analysis of the}} <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> is essential for comparative human identifications. The current study investigates radiographic morphological changes in the <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> according to vertical angle distortions in posteroanterior (PA) radiographs. A standard PA radiograph of the skull of an adult was obtained. Eight addition PA radiographs were taken at different vertical angles. <b>Frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively according to Ribeiro´s (2000) technique. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed significant image distortions. Further, overlapping anatomical structures were reported when PA radiographs were analyzed in negative angulation distortions (from - 10 ° to - 40 °). Positive and negative angular distortions up to 20 º slightly affected the qualitative morphological analysis. However, 10 ° positive and negative distortions provided a significant interference in quantitative analysis and impaired the measuring process. Most forensic techniques {{for the analysis of}} <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> comprise measurements of morphological distances. Distortions of approximately 10 ° or over in vertical angulation of cranial PA radiographs should be avoided so that more accurate comparative human identifications could be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Giant osteomas of the ethmoid and <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> ary very rare, {{with only}} a few dozen cases {{reported}} in the literature. Given their rarity, the clinical characteristics and treatment of this disease remain controversial. In this study, the clinical presentation and surgical methods used to treat three patients with giant osteomas of the ethmoid and <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> are described, combined with {{a review of the literature}} from 1975 to 2011. In total, 45 patients with giant osteomas arising from the ethmoid and <b>frontal</b> <b>sinuses</b> (including the present cases) have been reported in 41 articles. Headache and ocular signs are the most common symptoms. This disease often leads to intracranial or intraorbital complications. The main treatment for giant osteoma is surgery via an external approach. The outcome of surgery for giant osteoma is good, with rare recurrence, no malignant transformation and few persistent symptoms...|$|R
2500|$|Sinus {{infection}} {{can spread}} through anastomosing veins or by direct extension to close structures. Orbital complications were categorized by Chandler et al. into five stages {{according to their}} severity (see table). Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in periorbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess. Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins thrombophlebitis enables {{the spread of the}} infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth. Sinusitis may extend to the central nervous system, where it may cause cavernous sinus thrombosis, retrograde meningitis, and epidural, subdural, and brain abscesses. Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection [...] Other complications include sinobronchitis, maxillary osteomyelitis, and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone often originates from a spreading thrombo-phlebitis. A periostitis of the <b>frontal</b> <b>sinus</b> causes an osteitis and a periostitis of the outer membrane, which produces a tender, puffy swelling of the forehead.|$|E

6000|$|Do {{not expect}} from a child any great amount of moral goodness. During early years every civilised man passes through that phase of {{character}} exhibited by the barbarous race from which he is descended. As the child's features--flat nose, forward-opening nostrils, large lips, wide-apart eyes, absent <b>frontal</b> <b>sinus,</b> etc.--resemble for a time those of the savage, so, too, do his instincts. Hence the tendencies to cruelty, to thieving, to lying, so general among children--tendencies which, even {{without the aid of}} discipline, will become more or less modified just as the features do. The popular idea that children are [...] "innocent," [...] while it is true with respect to evil knowledge, is totally false with respect to evil impulses; as half an hour's observation in the nursery will prove to any one. Boys when left to themselves, as at public schools, treat each other more brutally than men do; and were they left to themselves at an earlier age their brutality would be still more conspicuous.|$|E

Consequently this structure does not show on radiographs before that time. Sinus development begins in the womb, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present at birth.

6000|$|There is a {{difference}} between arrested development and arrested growth, for parts in the former state continue to grow whilst still retaining their early condition. Various monstrosities come under this head; and some, as a cleft palate, are known to be occasionally inherited. It will suffice for our purpose to refer to the arrested brain-development of microcephalous idiots, as described in Vogt's memoir. (36. 'Memoires sur les Microcephales,' 1867, pp. 50, 125, 169, 171, 184-198.) Their skulls are smaller, and the convolutions of the brain are less complex than in normal men. The <b>frontal</b> <b>sinus,</b> or the projection over the eye-brows, is largely developed, and the jaws are prognathous to an [...] "effrayant" [...] degree; so that these idiots somewhat resemble the lower types of mankind. Their intelligence, and most of their mental faculties, are extremely feeble. They cannot acquire the power of speech, and are wholly incapable of prolonged attention, but are much given to imitation. They are strong and remarkably active, continually gambolling and jumping about, and making grimaces. They often ascend stairs on all-fours; and are curiously fond of climbing up furniture or trees. We are thus reminded of the delight shewn by almost all boys in climbing trees; and this again reminds us how lambs and kids, originally alpine animals, delight to frisk on any hillock, however small. Idiots also resemble the lower animals in some other respects; thus several cases are recorded of their carefully smelling every mouthful of food before eating it. One idiot is described as often using his mouth in aid of his hands, whilst hunting for lice. They are often filthy in their habits, and have no sense of decency; and several cases have been published of their bodies being remarkably hairy. (37. Prof. Laycock sums up the character of brute-like idiots by calling them [...] "theroid;" [...] 'Journal of Mental Science,' July 1863. Dr. Scott ('The Deaf and Dumb,' 2nd ed. 1870, p. 10) has often observed the imbecile smelling their food. See, on this same subject, and on the hairiness of idiots, Dr. Maudsley, 'Body and Mind,' 1870, pp. 46-51. Pinel has also given a striking case of hairiness in an idiot.) ...|$|E
60|$|Whether {{an advance}} from the {{homogeneous}} to the heterogeneous {{is or is}} not displayed in the biological history of the globe, it is clearly enough displayed in the progress of the latest and most heterogeneous creature--Man. It is true alike that, during the period in which the Earth has been peopled, the human organism has grown more heterogeneous among the civilized divisions of the species; and that the species, as a whole, has been growing more heterogeneous in virtue of the multiplication of races and the differentiation of these races from each other. In proof of the first of these positions, we may cite the fact that, in the relative development of the limbs, the civilized man departs more widely from the general type of the placental mammalia than do the lower human races. While often possessing well-developed body and arms, the Australian has very small legs: thus reminding us of the chimpanzee and the gorilla, which present no great contrasts in size between the hind and fore limbs. But in the European, the greater length and massiveness of the legs have become marked--the fore and hind limbs are more heterogeneous. Again, the greater ratio which the cranial bones bear to the facial bones illustrates the same truth. Among the vertebrata in general, progress is marked by an increasing heterogeneity in the vertebral column, and more especially in the segments constituting the skull: the higher forms being distinguished by the relatively larger size of the bones which cover the brain, and the relatively smaller size of those which form the jaws, &c. Now this characteristic, which is stronger in Man than in any other creature, is stronger in the European than in the savage. Moreover, judging from the greater extent and variety of faculty he exhibits, we may infer that the civilized man has also a more complex or heterogeneous nervous system than the uncivilized man: and, indeed, the fact is in part visible in the increased ratio which his cerebrum bears to the subjacent ganglia, {{as well as in the}} wider departure from symmetry in its convolutions. If further elucidation be needed, we may find it in every nursery. The infant European has sundry marked points of resemblance to the lower human races; as in the flatness of the alæ of the nose, the depression of its bridge, the divergence and forward opening of the nostrils, the form of the lips, the absence of a <b>frontal</b> <b>sinus,</b> the width between the eyes, the smallness of the legs.
