5000|$|<b>Draw</b> <b>Latch</b> is a two part latch {{where one}} side has an arm that can clasp {{to the other}} half, and as it closes the clasp pulls the two parts together. Frequently used on tool boxes, chests, crates and windows. Doesn't need to be fully closed to secure both halves.|$|E
60|$|We <b>drew</b> the <b>latch,</b> and in {{stumbled}} Etienne Girod (as he afterward named himself). But {{just then}} he {{was no more than}} a worm struggling for life, enveloped in a killing white chrysalis.|$|R
60|$|Softly now, {{like one}} who has only one sense, the tactile sense, he turned the latch. It clicked. He held still. The bed-clothes rustled. His heart did not beat. Then again he <b>drew</b> the <b>latch</b> back, and very gently pushed the door. It made a {{sticking}} noise as it gave.|$|R
60|$|After a {{few moments}} he <b>drew</b> back the <b>latch,</b> and slipped out, {{shutting}} the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In about five minutes his valet appeared half dressed, and looking very drowsy.|$|R
50|$|Tanimbar corellas {{learn by}} {{watching}} and copying. Just by opening the cage door, a Tanimbar corella's attention can be <b>drawn</b> to the <b>latch</b> on its cage {{and it can}} learn {{by trial and error}} how to open the latch with its beak and escape the cage in seconds. Tanimbar corellas can destroy furniture with their beaks and can chew through wires and cause potentially dangerous electrical incidents.|$|R
60|$|Rasmunsen {{followed}} {{him out and}} turned the dogs loose. He threw them all the salmon he had bought, and coiled a sled-lashing up in his hand. Then he re-entered the cabin and <b>drew</b> the <b>latch</b> in after him. The smoke from the cindered steak made his eyes smart. He stood on the bunk, passed the lashing over the ridge-pole, and measured the swing-off with his eye. It {{did not seem to}} satisfy, for he put the stool on the bunk and climbed upon the stool. He drove a noose in the end of the lashing and slipped his head through. The other end he made fast. Then he kicked the stool out from under.|$|R
60|$|She saw the benevolent motive of his proposal, {{and did not}} {{hesitate}} to comply with it. But, as they paused at the cottage door, she could not but observe that its exterior promised few of the comforts which they required. Time and neglect seemed to have conspired for its ruin; and, but for a thin curl of smoke from its clay chimney, they could not have believed it to be inhabited. A considerable tract of land {{in the vicinity of the}} cottage had evidently been, at some former period, under cultivation, but was now overrun by bushes and dwarf pines, among which many huge gray rocks, ineradicable by human art, endeavored to conceal themselves. About half an acre of ground was occupied by the young blades of Indian-corn, at which a half-starved cow gazed wistfully over the mouldering log-fence. These were the only agricultural tokens. Edward Walcott, nevertheless, <b>drew</b> the <b>latch</b> of the cottage door, after knocking loudly but in vain.|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} to develop a radio {{controlled}} door holder system as the first in a range of radio based products for Stephenson Gobin Eng Co. Ltd. Stephenson Gobin manufacture and market a wide range of electromechanical products, including retaining devices for fire doors and smoke vents. Typical installations are in hospitals, nursing homes, shopping centers, hotels or any building open to the public. The author discusses why a radio controlled door holder system is commercially and technically viable. Various wired and Wirefree door holder systems are evaluated on merits of safety and ease of installation. Stephenson Gobin developed a bi-stable latching door holding device which consumed no current in a state that was capable of holding a fire door open. This was due to a rotating magnetic slug assembly which only <b>drew</b> current to <b>latch</b> from one state to other. The device needed to be controlled wirelessly and possible methods of communication were assessed. Communicating using the license free radio frequency spectrum was selected due to the falling costs of radio components and the huge growth in the radio communication sector. The author developed and tested the hardware and software necessary to communicate with and actuate such a device...|$|R
6000|$|As {{in nearly}} all places on the Continent, a house in Venice means a number of rooms, {{including}} a whole story in a building, or part of it only, but always completely separated from the story above and below, or from the other rooms on the same floor. Every house has its own entrance from the street, or by a common hall and stairway from the ground-floor, where are the cellars or store-rooms, while each kitchen is usually on a level with the other rooms {{of the house to}} which it belongs. The isolation of the different families is secured (as perfectly as where a building is solely appropriated to each), either by the exclusive possession of a street- door, [Footnote: Where the street entrance is in common, every floor has its bell, which being sounded, summons a servant to some upper window with the demand, most formidable to strangers, [...] "Chi xe?" [...] (Who is it?) But you do not answer with your name. You reply, [...] "Amici!" [...] (Friends!) on which comforting reassurance, the servant <b>draws</b> the <b>latch</b> of the door by a wire running upward to her hand, and permits you to enter and wander about at your leisure till you reach her secret height. This is, supposing the master or mistress of the house to be at home. If they are not in, she answers your [...] "Amici!" [...] with [...] "No ghe ne xe!" [...] (Nobody here!) and lets down a basket by a string outside the window, and fishes up your card.] or by the unsocial domestic habits of Europe. You bow and give good-day to the people whom you meet in the common hall and on the common stairway, but you rarely know more of them than their names, and you certainly care nothing about them. The sociability of Europe, and more especially of Southern Europe, is shown abroad; under the domestic roof it dwindles and disappears. And indeed it is no wonder, considering how dispiriting and comfortless most of the houses are. The lower windows are heavily barred with iron; the wood-work is rude, even in many palaces in Venice; the rest is stone and stucco; the walls are not often papered, though they are sometimes painted: the most pleasing and inviting feature of the interior is the frescoed ceiling of the better rooms. The windows shut imperfectly, the heavy wooden blinds imperviously (is it worth while to observe that there are no Venetian blinds in Venice?); the doors lift slantingly from the floor, in which their lower hinges are imbedded; the stoves are of plaster, and consume fuel without just return of heat; the balconies alone are always charming, whether they hang high over the streets, or look out upon the canals, and, with the gayly painted ceilings, go far to make the houses habitable.|$|R
