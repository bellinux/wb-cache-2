50|$|The Quâ€™Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway {{came through}} between Regina and Prince Albert through Saskatoon {{as early as}} 1890 {{providing}} an early method of travel following the red river cart and trail days. Chamberlain and Aylesbury were first linked via a highway in 1929, before this date transportation between the two was {{by a variety of}} trails. The summer of 1929 also started another road leaving the Qu'Appelle River valley east. Construction required building up low spots with elevating graders and dump wagons operated by horses. The <b>elevating</b> <b>grader</b> was to till unbroken soil and turn it towards a conveyor which lifted the dirt into the dump wagons. This process used 8 horses pulling in the front, and another eight at the rear pushing. The fresno crew constructed the level areas. Ditches were constructed on a 7% grade and filled with field rock to help prevent erosion. One of the main problems constructing the highway was the heavy field stone knolls. This highway served until 1949 when it was upgraded.|$|E
