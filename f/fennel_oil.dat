In order to assess the protection of <b>fennel</b> <b>oil</b> on SVP induced hepato- and nephro-toxicity, male albino rats were treated with 1 ml/kg b. w <b>fennel</b> <b>oil</b> 3 days/week for 6 weeks. The biochemical analyses of hepatic enzymes were evaluated by estimating blood biomarkers of liver and renal damage along with histological examination. The results obtained from this work showed that treating animals with SVP lead to many histopathological alterations in the liver and kidney tissues. The effect appeared in the liver tissue include leukocyte infiltrations, cytoplasmic vacuolization of the hepatocytes, fatty degeneration and congestion of blood vessels. Th{{is commonly}} used chemical (SVP) caused some unwanted effects on the kidney cortex which histologically observed as degeneration in renal tubules, atrophy of the glomeruli and edema. Biochemical results also revealed an abnormal increase in the enzyme level of AST, SAT, ALP, bilirubin, creatinine and urea-nitrogen, with a noticed decrease in total protein content.

The <b>fennel</b> <b>oil</b> is useful in pharmaceutical industry as flavor. The main component of <b>fennel</b> <b>oil</b> is anethole (55 - 75 %). The objective of this work was to identify the effect of  particle size, pH of water, method of distillation and using ultrasound on extraction of fennel essential oil (and its major constituent, anethole). Methods: We used a statistical method called D-optimal Design that appointed pH, particle size and method for each assay. Fennel seeds were purchased, then milled and passed from different meshes. In the first series, the seeds powder was distilled directly. In the second series the seeds were placed in an ultrasonic apparatus for 30 min. The essential oils were subsequently isolated by two methods, hydro distillation and steam distillation, in different sizes (25, 30, 40, 50) and pH (5. 5, 5. 8, 7, 7. 4, 8. 5). Fifty g of dry seeds were used in each distillation (for 3 h). Analytical gas chromatography (GC) {{was used to determine}} the essential oil composition. Results: In the steam distillation, the volume of essential oils and the concentration of anethole, whatever the plant became smaller, was less. However, in the water distillation, it was more and by comparing the two steps, without and with ultrasound, it increased 20 % after the ultrasound. Conclusion: optimum conditions according to the statistical results were steam distillation, mesh size 50 and using ultrasounic device...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} inhibitory {{properties of}} combinations of oil of <b>fennel,</b> <b>oil</b> of anise or oil of basil with either benzoic acid or methyl-paraben against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteriditis. Micro-organisms were cultured at 37 degrees C in broth and viable counts measured over a 48 -h period. S. enteriditis was particularly sensitive to inhibition {{by a combination}} of oil of anise, fennel or basil with methyl-paraben where there was < 10 CFU/ml after 1 h. L. monocytogenes was less sensitive to inhibition by each combination however there was a significant reduction in growth of 4 - 8 log by combinations of all oils and methyl-paraben at 8, 24 and 48 h. Synergistic inhibition by one or more combinations was evident against each micro-organism...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} has been conducted to synthesize thiomethylated-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene using <b>fennel</b> <b>oil</b> as a starting material. The synthesis was carried out in four steps i. e. (1) oxidation of anethole to yield p-anisaldehyde, (2) HCl-catalyzed condensation of p-anisaldehyde with resorcinol, (3) chloromethylation of C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene with paraformaldehyde and HCl in the presence of ZnCl 2 to yield tetrakis-chloromethyl-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene, and (4) reaction of tetrakis-chloromethyl-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene with thiourea followed by hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide solution to yield tetrakis-thiomethyl-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene. The prepared compounds were characterized based on melting point, FT-IR, and NMR spectrometers. According to the analysis of 1 H-NMR spectrometer, C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene and tetrakis-chloromethyl-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene were observed in the chair or flattened partial cone conformation, while tetrakis-thiomethyl-C- 4 -methoxyphenylcalix[4]resorcinarene tend to exist in the crown or cone conformation...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{blood orange}} juice may be {{somewhat}} tart, while other kinds are sweet [...] while retaining the characteristic blood orange taste. The oranges {{can also be used}} to create marmalade, and the zest can be used for baking. A popular Sicilian winter salad is made with sliced blood oranges, sliced bulb <b>fennel,</b> and olive <b>oil.</b> The oranges have also been used to create gelato, sorbet, and Italian soda. Blood oranges are also popular in vinaigrette-style dressings, and are sometimes used to flavor niche-market beer.|$|R

Combined effect of -irradiation at 2 Krad dose and GA 3 treatment at 50 mgL - 1 concentration {{resulted in the}} maximum germination percentage, seed production, essential oil yield, {{as well as the}} best quality of <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare) <b>oil</b> because of its high content of the flavour compounds, e. g. trans-anethole and fenchone. GA 3 application reduced the harmful effects of higher irradiation doses (5 - 20 krad) ...|$|R
30|$|Almost {{all parts}} of fennel plant are edible. The herb is used as carminative, digestive, and diuretic. It is used in {{treating}} respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders (Diao et al. 2014; El-Motaium and El-Seoud 2007). Furthermore, its insect rippling and antimicrobial properties against {{a wide range of}} microorganisms have been well established (Qiu et al. 2012; Oktay et al. 2003). <b>Fennel</b> essential <b>oil</b> is used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and perfumery and as a food additive and flavouring agent in food products (Kim et al. 2004; Mohamad et al. 2011; Rather et al. 2012; Oktay et al. 2003). The fennel fruits are used as flavourings in baked goods, meat and fish dishes, ice cream, alcoholic beverages and herb mixtures. Fennel fruit tea and fennel fruit water are very common traditional medicines for flatulence treatment (He and Huang 2011; Rather et al. 2012). In China, fennel fruit is used both as tradition Chinese medicine and as common food with Chinese name Xiaohuixiang (He and Huang 2011).|$|R
