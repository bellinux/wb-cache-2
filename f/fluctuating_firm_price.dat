When the discount factor is particularly high or particularly low both <b>firms</b> <b>price</b> discriminate in equilibrium. For intermediate discount factors and high firms'asymmetry, the unique equilibrium is characterized by only the smaller <b>firm</b> choosing <b>price</b> discrimination.

40|$|In this paper, whe {{show that}} the {{strategic}} choice of spatial price policy under duopoly crucially depends on the rules of price competition. Thisse and Vives (1988) show that spatial price discrimination is a dominant strategy when the mill <b>pricing</b> <b>firm</b> is the leader and the discriminatory firm is the follower. When the leader-follower roles are reversed we find that equilibrium pricing policies depend on the consumer's reservation value. The pricing policy game has two equilibria in pure strategies, either both <b>firms</b> <b>price</b> uniformly (f. o. b.) or both <b>firms</b> <b>price</b> discriminate, when the reservation value is low. For intermediate levels of the reservation value, price discrimination is a dominant strategy and the pricing policy game {{is similar to a}} Prisoner's Dilemma. When the consumer reservation value is large enough we obtain asymmetric equilibria in which one <b>firm</b> <b>prices</b> according to f. o. b. and the other price discriminates. We also analyze the case of simultaneous price competition and find a mixed strategies equilibrium for the price competition subgame such that the pricing policy game has two equilibria in pure strategies, either both <b>firms</b> <b>price</b> uniformly or both <b>firms</b> <b>price</b> discriminate. spatial price discrimination, price policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a monopoly}} <b>firm's</b> <b>pricing</b> strategy {{in a market}} in which consumers have varying and imprecise estimates {{of the quality of}} the firm's product. It is shown that the <b>firm's</b> <b>price</b> declines in response to an increase in the level of consumer uncertainty about quality when consumer tastes for the product are sufficiently similar and their uncertainty about quality is sufficiently small. When one or both of these conditions fails to hold, however, it is shown that the monopoly <b>firm's</b> <b>price</b> is positively related to the level of consumer uncertainty about quality.

We find that <b>firm</b> <b>pricing</b> is indeed asymmetric, as Tobin (1972) suggested long ago. Moreover, there is strong evidence to support Ball and Mankiw's (1994) suggestion that <b>firm</b> <b>price</b> asymmetry is dependent on inflation. However, Ball and Mankiw's theory seems to hold better for changes in costs than for changes in demand, a result which is consistent with the idea that <b>firm</b> <b>pricing</b> is influenced by a desire to preserve customer relations (Okun, 1981) or by information uncertainty (Dixit, 1976, Bhaduri and Falkinger, 1990). There is pervasive evidence of asymmetry in response to changes in costs during high inflation which tends to disappear during low inflation. There is no evidence of asymmetry in response to demand shocks at high rates of inflation. However, there is evidence that price changes are more responsive to demand decreases than to demand increases and this is more notable during low inflation. Thus, the effect of different rates of inflation on the demand asymmetry is broadly consistent with Bal...|$|R
