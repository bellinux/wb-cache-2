5000|$|Some {{officials}} in the Serbian government have proposed the partitioning of Kosovo, with North Kosovo and Štrpce becoming part of Serbia or given autonomy. The United States opposes the partition of Kosovo, stressing that the [...] "great majority of {{countries around the world}} are not going to stand for that." [...] In response to the seizure of railways in Northern Kosovo and formation of Serbian offices to serve as part of a parallel government, Kosovo's Prime Minister stated that they would [...] "not tolerate any parallel institution on Kosovo's territory" [...] and would assert their authority over all of Kosovo. The UN's Special Representative in Kosovo said the [...] "international community has {{made it very clear that}} no partition of Kosovo will be acceptable." [...] Ivan Eland, a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute, suggested such [...] "a partition within a partition" [...] would prevent a [...] "Serbia-Kosovo War" [...] and provides the [...] "best chance" [...] of Kosovo having a long-term stable relationship with Serbia. Chairman of the Serb Municipalities of Kosovo Alliance Marko Jakšić dismissed the talk of partition and said the action of Serbs in Kosovo is to protest the Kosovo declaration. Oliver Ivanović, a Kosovo Serb political leader, said he was against Kosovo's partition because [...] "most Serbs live south of the Ibar and their position would become unsustainable". A Reuters analysis suggested that Kosovo may be divided along ethnic lines similar to Bosnia-Herzegovina. James Lyon of the International Crisis Group thinktank was quoted as saying, [...] "the Republika Srpska style is acceptable for Serbia, but within the confines that it (Kosovo) is still part of Serbia." [...] Pieter Feith, the European Union's special representative in Kosovo, and the <b>International</b> <b>Civilian</b> <b>Representative</b> for Kosovo said no plans are under discussion to carve out a canton or grant any other autonomy to Serbs living in the north of Kosovo. He told the Pristina, Kosovo, daily Koha Ditore, [...] "It is quite clear that the privileged relations between the Serbs here (in Kosovo) and Belgrade are in the spheres of education, health care, and religious objects," [...] adding that [...] "the government in Pristina has to be respected." ...|$|E
