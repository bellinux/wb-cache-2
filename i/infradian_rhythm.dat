The length of nonhandled fish was estimated with a stereo-video technique and the length and mass of handled fish was measured directly. The main effects of handling and stocking density and their interactions on growth rates were not statistically significant, whereas the main effects of time were significant, as shown by repeated measure analysis. Multifrequential periodogram analysis indicated significant <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> components of about 8 d in the relative growth rate in length and of about 5 and 11 d in the relative growth rate in mass, regardless of the treatment applied.

40|$|SummaryThe {{steady-state}} {{concept of}} Na+ homeostasis, based on short-term investigations {{of responses to}} high salt intake, maintains that dietary Na+ is rapidly eliminated into urine, thereby achieving constant total-body Na+ and water content. We introduced the reverse experimental approach by fixing salt intake of men participating in space flight simulations at 12 g, 9 g, and 6 g/day for months and tested for the predicted constancy in urinary excretion and total-body Na+ content. At constant salt intake, daily Na+ excretion exhibited aldosterone-dependent, weekly (circaseptan) rhythms, resulting in periodic Na+ storage. Changes in total-body Na+ (± 200 – 400  mmol) exhibited longer <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> periods (about monthly and longer period lengths) without parallel changes in body weight and extracellular water and were directly related to urinary aldosterone excretion and inversely to urinary cortisol, suggesting rhythmic hormonal control. Our findings define rhythmic Na+ excretory and retention patterns independent of blood pressure or body water, which occur independent of salt intake...|$|E
40|$|Background: Circadian rhythm stage affects many outcomes, {{including}} those of mental aging. Methods: Estimations of 1 minute ∼ 5 times/day for a year, 25 years apart, by a healthy male biomedical scientist (RBS), are analyzed by the extended cosinor. Results: Cycles of a half-week, a week, ∼ 30 days, a half-year and a year, in self-assessed 1 -minute estimation by RBS between 25 and 60 years of age in health, are mapped for the fi rst time, compared and opposite effects are found. For RBS at 60 vs at 25 years of age, it takes less time in the morning around 10 : 30 (P 0. 001), {{but not in the}} evening around 19 : 30 (P = 0. 956), to estimate 1 minute. Discussion: During the intervening decades, the time of estimating 1 minute differed greatly, dependent on circadian stage, being a linear decrease in the morning and increase in the evening, the latter modulated by a ∼ 33. 6 -year cycle. Conclusion: Circadian and <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> mapping is essential for a scrutiny of effects of aging. A ∼ 30 -day and a circannual component apparent at 25 years of age are not found later; cycles longer than a year are detected.

40|$|Many {{studies showed}} that the {{occurrence}} of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events exhibits a seasonal and monthly variation. Evidences of a seasonal and monthly variation {{in the incidence of}} venous thromboembolism (VTE) are more conflicting. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the presence of an <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> of this disease. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to January 2010. Monthly and seasonal variation in the incidence of VTE were analysed. We included studies analysing seasonal or monthly aggregation in the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) with an objective diagnosis of VTE. Two authors independently reviewed and extracted data. Seventeen studies for a total of about 35, 000 patients were included. Twelve studies analysed the seasonal variation and 10 studies the monthly variation of VTE. Our results showed a significantly increased incidence of VTE in winter (chi-square 146. 04, p < 0. 001), with a relative risk (RR) of VTE of 1. 143 (99 % CI [1. 141, 1. 144]), and a significantly increased incidence of VTE in January (chi-square 232. 57, p < 0. 001) with an RR of VTE of 1. 194 (99 % CI 1. 186, 1. 203). Subgroup analyses including only idiopathic venous thromboembolic events confirmed the results of principal analyses. In conclusion, our data support the presence of an infradian pattern in the incidence of venous thromboembolic events, with a significantly higher risk in Winter and in January. Future studies are needed to better clarify the mechanisms behind this pattern...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{intake of}} sodium, chloride, and {{potassium}} is considered important to healthy nutrition and cardiovascular disease risk. Estimating the intake of these electrolytes {{is difficult and}} usually predicated on urine collections, commonly for 24 h, which are considered the gold standard. We reported on data earlier for sodium but not for potassium or chloride. Objective: We were able to test the value of 24 -h urine collections in a unique, ultra-long–term balance study conducted during a simulated trip to Mars. Design: Four healthy men were observed while ingesting 12 g salt/d, 9 g salt/d, and 6 g salt/d, while their potassium intakewasmaintained at 4 g/d for 105 d. Six healthy men were studied while ingesting 12 g salt/d, 9 g salt/d, and 6 g salt/d, with a re-exposure of 12 g/d, while their potassium intake was maintained at 4 g/d for 205 d. Food intake and other constituents were recorded every day for each subject. All urine output was collected daily. Results: Long-term urine recovery rates for all 3 electrolytes were very high. Rather than the expected constant daily excretion related to daily intake, we observed remarkable daily variation in excretion, with a 7 -d <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm</b> at a relatively constant intake. We monitored 24 -h aldosterone excretion in these studies and found that aldosterone {{appeared to be the}} regulator for all 3 electrolytes. We report Bland–Altman analyses on the value of urine collections to estimate intake. Conclusions: A single 24 -h urine collection cannot predict sodium, potassium, or chloride intake; thus, multiple collections are necessary. This information is important when assessing electrolyte intake in individuals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Elucidating {{the neural}} and genetic factors {{underlying}} psychiatric illness is hampered by current methods of clinical diagnosis. The identification and investigation of clinical endophenotypes {{may be one}} solution, but represents a considerable challenge in human subjects. Here we report that mice heterozygous for a null mutation of the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha-CaMKII+/-) have profoundly dysregulated behaviours and impaired neuronal development in the dentate gyrus (DG). The behavioral abnormalities include a severe working memory deficit and an exaggerated <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythm,</b> which are similar to symptoms seen in schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Transcriptome analysis of the hippocampus of these mutants revealed that the expression levels of more than 2000 genes were significantly changed. Strikingly, among the 20 most downregulated genes, 5 had highly selective expression in the DG. Whereas BrdU incorporated cells in the mutant mouse DG was {{increased by more than}} 50 percent, the number of mature neurons in the DG was dramatically decreased. Morphological and physiological features of the DG neurons in the mutants were strikingly similar to those of immature DG neurons in normal rodents. Moreover, c-Fos expression in the DG after electric footshock was almost completely and selectively abolished in the mutants. Statistical clustering of human post-mortem brains using 10 genes differentially-expressed in the mutant mice were used to classify individuals into two clusters, one of which contained 16 of 18 schizophrenic patients. Nearly half of the differentially-expressed probes in the schizophrenia-enriched cluster encoded genes that are involved in neurogenesis or in neuronal migration/maturation, including calbindin, a marker for mature DG neurons. Based on these results, we propose that an "immature DG" in adulthood might induce alterations in behavior and serve as a promising candidate endophenotype of schizophrenia and other human psychiatric disorders. </p...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{influence}} on psychological adaptation, biological rhythms associated with sleep have received growing attention {{during the last two}} decades.

40|$|Circumnutation is a helical organ {{movement}} widespread among plants. It is variable due to {{a different}} magnitude of trajectory (amplitude) outlined by the organ tip, duration of one cycle (period), circular, elliptical, pendulum-like or irregular shape and clock- and counterclockwise direction of rotation. Some of those movement parameters are regulated by circadian clock and show daily and <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Circumnutation is influenced by light, temperature, chemicals and can depend on organ morphology. The diversity of this phenomenon is easier to see now that the digital time-lapse video method is developing fast. Whether circumnutation is an endogenous action, a reaction to exogenous stimuli or has a combined character has been discussed for a long time. Similarly, the relationship between growth and circumnutation is still unclear. In the mechanism of circumnutation, epidermal and endodermal cells as well as plasmodesmata, plasma membrane, ions (Ca 2 +, K+ and Cl−), ion channels and the proton pump (H+ATPase) are engaged. Based on these data, the hypothetical electrophysiological model of the circumnutation mechanism has been proposed here. In the recent circumnutation studies, gravitropic, auxin, clock and phytochrome mutants are used and new functions of circumnutation in plants' life have been investigated and described...|$|R
40|$|Current {{teaching}} {{states that}} when sodium intake is increased from low to high levels, total-body sodium (TBNa) and water increase until daily sodium excretion again equals intake. When sodium intake is reduced, sodium excretion briefly exceeds intake until the excess TBNa and water are eliminated, {{at which point}} sodium excretion again equals intake. However, careful balance studies oftentimes conflict with this view and long-term studies suggest that TBNa fluctuates independent of intake or body weight. We recently performed the opposite experiment in that we fixed sodium intake for several weeks at three levels of sodium intake and collected all urine made. We found weekly (circaseptan) patterns in sodium excretion that {{were inversely related to}} aldosterone and directly to cortisol. TBNa was not dependent on sodium intake but instead exhibited far longer (Xmonthly) <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> independent of extracellular water, body weight, or blood pressure. The findings are consistent with our ideas on tissue sodium storage and its regulation that we developed on the basis of animal research. We are implementing 23 Na-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to pursue open questions on sodium balance in patients. Our findings could be relevant to therapeutic strategies for hypertension and target-organ damage...|$|R
40|$|The heart rate(HR) of Muscovy duck embryos (Cairina moschata f. domestica) was {{continuously}} recorded from {{as early}} as the 21 st day of incubation (D 21) until hatching (D 34 / 35). The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the influence of phonoperiods consisting of different acoustic stimuli on the course of HR and the development of HR periodicities during this period. Incubation was carried out at a constant temperature and in constant darkness. Until D 25 HR was dominated by decelerative fluctuations only, indicating a main input from the parasympathetic system on the heart. Later sympathetic influences increased progressively. HR periodicity was investigated by means of x 2 -periodogram and fast Fourier transformation. Between D 26 and D 30 statistically significant and stable HR periodicities developed gradually. They had periods in the range from 5 to 38 hours. Ultra-, circa- and <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> (28 h, respectively) occurred in parallel in some cases in the same embryo. During these important periods HR courses were dissimilar between individual embryos and had different intensities.

40|$|In biology, {{circadian}} rhythms with {{a period}} of one cycle in 20 – 28 h {{are known to be}} ubiquitous and partly endogenous. Rhythms with a frequency lower than one cycle per day are called 'infradian rhythms'. Among them are components with one cycle in about 3. 5, 7, 14 and 28 days, the multiseptans, which, like the circadians, must be regarded as a general characteristic of life: they characterize unicells as well as much more differentiated organisms. We hypothesize that heliogeophysical factors other than the solar visible light, held responsible for the evolution of circadian periodicity, underlie the <b>infradian</b> <b>rhythms</b> of biosystems. The periodicities in the solar wind and variations in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) which are associated with the solar rotation are very similar in length to the biological periodicities. We investigate the temporal relations of variations in solar activity and in biological systems to test associations between events in the IMF, in geomagnetic disturbance, in myocardial infarction and in physiology. By cross-spectral analysis, we also find relations at certain frequencies between changes in human physiology on the one hand, and (1) the vertical component of the induction vector of the IMF, Bz, and (2) a global index of geomagnetic disturbance, Kp, on the other hand. We wish to stimulate interest in these periodicities of both biological systems and geophysical endpoints among physicists and biologists alike, so that problems relevant to clinicians and other biologists, including evolutionists, are eventually solved by their cooperation with the geophysical community...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHow nonhuman {{primates}} {{deal with}} birth, {{at the moment}} of delivery, and during the following days, remains poorly explored because of the unpredictability of this event, particularly for forest-dwelling arboreal species. Available studies highlight intra- and interspecific variation which suggest flexibility of the timing of delivery, of behavior associated with labor contractions and parturition, and the social context and ambient noise surrounding delivery. Here, we present the findings of a two-decade survey of reproduction in a population of captive Campbell's monkeys. Analysis of 34 births (with a female-biased sex ratio) showed that deliveries occurred systematically at night and more frequently during week-ends and in fall (September–November). This suggests the existence of both circadian and <b>infradian</b> biological <b>rhythms.</b> We present the first detailed description of a birth for this species and its short-term social consequences. In line with previous findings for other monkeys and apes, labor (estimated by unusual stretching postures) and parturition were rapid, and delivery occurred in a clear social and vocal context. During the following days, the new mother became the center of attention of for young (kin and non-kin) females and rose through the hierarchy. We discuss socio-ecological factors, notably captivity conditions and the high degree of tolerance in the species’ social system, and confirm the existence of both “rigidity” and “flexibility” in the primates’ adaptive reproductive strategies...|$|R
