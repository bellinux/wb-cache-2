40|$|Firmware for {{implementing}} a <b>digital</b> <b>phasemeter</b> within a {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA) has been devised. In the original application of this firmware, the phase that one seeks to measure {{is the difference between}} the phases of two nominally-equal-frequency heterodyne signals generated by two interferometers. In that application, zero-crossing detectors convert the heterodyne signals to trains of rectangular pulses, the two pulse trains are fed to a fringe counter (the major part of the phasemeter) controlled by a clock signal having a frequency greater than the heterodyne frequency, and the fringe counter computes a time-averaged estimate of the difference between the phases of the two pulse trains. The firmware also does the following: Causes the FPGA to compute the frequencies of the input signals; Causes the FPGA to implement an Ethernet (or equivalent) transmitter for readout of phase and frequency values; and Provides data for use in diagnosis of communication failures. The readout rate can be set, by programming, to a value between 250 Hz and 1 kHz. Network addresses can be programmed by the user...|$|E
40|$|The first direct {{detection}} of gravitational waves is greatly anticipated by scientists {{since it would}} lead to a whole new observational spectrum, beyond electromagnetic radiation and highly energetic particles. ESA and NASA are currently planning a space-based gravitational wave detector named LISA, or Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, but key technologies are yet to be developed before such ambitious mission can be realized. In this respect, the Laboratory for Enabling Technologies (LET) at EADS Astrium has been engaged with the development of state-of-the-art enabling technologies for LISA, including the development of an ultra-precise phasemeter. The LISA metrology concept requires the {{detection of}} picometer distance variations in the frequency range from 0. 1 mHz to 0. 1 Hz and with sensitivity of 12 pm/√Hz. Therefore, the phasemeter is required to perform with microradian precision (few μcycles/√Hz). The goal of this work was the development of a FPGA-based <b>digital</b> <b>phasemeter</b> as a technology demonstrator for LISA. As a result, a prototype for the LISA phasemeter was developed which can support up to eight parallel channels. Therefore, it allows for the measurement of phase differences between a pair of quadrant photodiodes, which can be useful for differential wavefront sensing. In addition, an analog compensation scheme for phase noise corrections was investigated. This investigation resulted in the design and fabrication of a pilot tone board for ADC jitter calibration. Finally, it was also demonstrated that, under certain conditions, the phasemeter can operate within the stipulated LISA requirements. Validerat; 20110124 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|A <b>digital</b> {{averaging}} <b>phasemeter</b> {{has been}} built for measuring {{the difference between the}} phases of the unknown and reference heterodyne signals in a heterodyne laser interferometer. This phasemeter performs well enough to enable interferometric measurements of distance with accuracy of the order of 100 pm and with the ability to track distance as it changes at a speed of as much as 50 cm/s. This phasemeter is unique in that it is a single, integral system capable of performing three major functions that, heretofore, have been performed by separate systems: (1) measurement of the fractional-cycle phase difference, (2) counting of multiple cycles of phase change, and (3) averaging of phase measurements over multiple cycles for improved resolution. This phasemeter also offers the advantage of making repeated measurements at a high rate: the phase is measured on every heterodyne cycle. Thus, for example, in measuring the relative phase of two signals having a heterodyne frequency of 10 kHz, the phasemeter would accumulate 10, 000 measurements per second. At this high measurement rate, an accurate average phase determination can be made more quickly than is possible at a lower rate...|$|R
