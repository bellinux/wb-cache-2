25|$|His {{description}} of aqueduct construction includes {{the way they}} are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although Frontinus (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance. Surely Vitruvius' book would have been of great assistance in this. Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest Roman aqueducts were built, and survive to this day, such as those at Segovia and the Pont du Gard. The use of the <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe {{at the base of the}} siphon, a practical problem with which he seems to be acquainted.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of an elevated aqueduct to carry the Croton Aqueduct over the valley in 1838-42 separated {{the eastern side of}} the valley from the village of Bloomingdale which had emerged around the Bloomingdale Road, until the 1870s when it was replaced with an underground <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon,</b> and the old aqueduct was torn down. Early development in the 1870s and 1880s focused on institutional care for the ill or aged, and included the Hebrew Home for the Aged, the Catholic Old Age Home, the Home for Respectable Aged Indigent Females, and the Towers Nursing Home constructed as a cancer ward by John Jacob Astor III in 1884. Also located in Manhattan Valley at the time was the New York Cancer Hospital, built in 1887 at 455 Central Park West. These, together with the Lion Brewery, gave the area its earliest landmarks. The neighborhood began to fill out residentially at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, when the New York City Subway's IRT Ninth Avenue Line in 1870 and the IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line in 1904 allowed the public ready access to uptown Manhattan. Columbia's purchase of the Bloomingdale Lunatic Asylum at around the same time as the subway's arrival naturally made the neighborhood more attractive as well.|$|E
50|$|Large <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> {{are used}} to convey water being carried in canals or flumes across valleys, for {{irrigation}} or gold mining. The Romans used <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> of multiple lead pipes to cross valleys that were too big to construct an aqueduct.|$|R

2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic gurgle as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

50|$|Winchburgh Tunnel is 367 yards long. It took 24 {{months to}} construct. Firedamp {{was a problem}} in the {{construction}} and a workman was badly burned. The Myers Burn west of the tunnel passes under the line in twin <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To allow {{surface water}} to drain freely across {{the path of}} the aqueduct, <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> were {{installed}} at fifty-six locations. Freezing was prevented by ensuring the outlet level was always below water level, preventing cold air from entering the siphon.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the excavated portions of the ditch, the project also included the construction of several <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons.</b> These were required because {{the route of the}} ditch gradually descended along natural ridges so it could be built without requiring pumps to move the water. The <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> carried the water across low points in the ridges (such as where they were crossed by streams or rivers), and were made of steel pipe. The pipe used in the siphons was cast in the Lower 48, transported by barge to an Alaska port, then by train and truck to the job site. The pipes ranged in diameter from 46 to 56 in and were made from steel. They were supported by timber pilings created from wood harvested {{at the site of the}} ditch.|$|R

2500|$|The aqueducts could {{stretch from}} [...] long, and {{typically}} descended from {{an elevation of}} [...] above sea level at the source, to [...] {{when they reached the}} reservoirs around the city. Roman engineers used <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> to move water across a valley if they judged it impractical to build a raised aqueduct. [...] The Roman legions were largely responsible for building the aqueducts. [...] Maintenance was often done by slaves.|$|R
50|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous aqueducts {{to supply}} water to cities and industrial sites and {{to aid in}} their agriculture. The city of Rome was supplied by 11 aqueducts with a combined length of 350 km. Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Sometimes, where valleys deeper than 500 m had to be crossed, <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> were used to convey water across a valley.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> are {{commonly}} called traps for their function in preventing smelly sewer gases from coming {{back out of}} drains and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain. Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up {{and out the other}} end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in sewage systems or culverts which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is [...] "depressed sewer".|$|R

50|$|Franklin's stove {{contained}} a baffle {{directly behind the}} fire, which forced the fire's fumes to flow downward before they reached the chimney. This required a U-shaped duct in the floor behind the stove, so that the fumes could flow from the stove into the chimney. Thus Franklin's stove incorporated an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1678 {{fireplace}} of Prince Rupert (1619-1682) {{also included}} an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon.</b> Rupert placed a hanging iron door between the fire grate and the chimney. In order to exit through the chimney, the fire's fumes and smoke {{first had to}} descend below {{the edge of the}} door before rising through the chimney.|$|E
5000|$|Roman aqueducts {{were built}} to remarkably fine tolerances, {{and to a}} {{technological}} standard that {{was not to be}} equalled until modern times. Powered entirely by gravity, they transported very large amounts of water very efficiently. Sometimes, where depressions deeper than 50 metres had to be crossed, <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> were used to force water uphill. An aqueduct also supplied water for the overshot wheels at Barbegal in Roman Gaul, a complex of water mills hailed as [...] "the greatest known concentration of mechanical power in the ancient world".|$|R
50|$|At maximum flow, {{the ditch}} {{was capable of}} {{transporting}} 180000 gal of water per day. It included 15 <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> that covered a distance of 6.13 mi. A tunnel 0.7 mi long also made up part of the ditch. The remainder was open canal. The longest section of pipeline was a 7961 ft siphon that crossed the Chatanika River with a head of 544 feet. The pipe had to cross its source because it had a gradient of 2.112 feet per mile, which was less than the river's gradient.|$|R
50|$|During {{the year}} of 1912, the city expropriated 40 {{property}} owners on Sooke Lake and on the proposed flowline right-of-way (ROW) at great cost. The city hired the Pacific Lock Joint Pipe Company to cast the pipe segments and using their patented design, constructed the pipeline. In between 1911-1915, this major engineering project employed over 400 workers and housed their families in rural Sooke. The pipe is almost completely at a constant elevation. Although figures vary, the slope from Sooke Lake to Humpback is between 0.0947% and 0.119% when the <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> are excluded.|$|R
50|$|This is {{probably}} the easiest segment to walk along. The pipe is very open and there are not too many trestles to cross. There is an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> in disrepair very close to Harbourview Road {{but it can be}} bypassed by an existing deer trail. Like many segments, this part is quite scenic but it passes through a quarry site, which takes away from the walk.|$|E
50|$|Most {{people would}} likely {{agree that this}} is the most {{beautiful}} part of the pipeline walk. There are expanses of mossy bluffs, large trees and gorgeous views. There are three concrete trestles which are easily crossed as well as an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> which requires a bushwack to get around. Impala Road should not be driven up as the road is very steep, unpaved, and has no parking at the top.|$|E
50|$|Franklin's stove sold poorly. The problem {{lay with}} the {{inverted}} siphon: the smoke {{had to pass}} through a cold flue (which was set in the floor) before the smoke could enter the chimney; consequently, the smoke cooled too much and the stove {{did not have a}} good draft. The <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> would operate properly only if the fire burned constantly, so that the temperature in the flue was high enough to produce a draft.|$|E
25|$|The tallest {{bridge was}} the Pont du Gard, which carried water across the Gard river to Nîmes, {{southern}} France. The 270m long aqueduct bridge {{was constructed in}} three tiers which measure successively 20.5m, 19.5m and 7.4m, adding up to a total height of 47.4m above the water-level. When crossing deeper valleys, Roman hydraulic engineers preferred <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> over bridges for reasons of relative economics; this {{is evident in the}} Gier aqueduct where seven out of nine siphons exceed the 45m mark, reaching depths up to 123m. The tallest road bridges were the monumental Alcántara Bridge, Spain, and the bridge at Narni, Italy, which rose above the stream-level c. 42m and 30m, respectively.|$|R
40|$|In Amsterdam, over 200 {{so called}} <b>inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> are situated. As these siphons are prone for blockages, it is key that these {{parts of a}} sewer system are {{maintained}} proactively. This article outlines {{the basis of a}} methodology {{that can be used to}} estimate the fouling degree of sewers with the use of water level measurements. Even though the measurement period appeared to be of restricted length, the methodology can be considered promising. Furthermore, evidence has been found that the cleaning regime plays a role in the initial accumulation of Fat, Oil and Grease (FOG), which therefore could be the basis of the development of effective measures to prevent blockages.

30|$|The {{efficient}} {{operation and}} maintenance of urban drainage systems is another key aspect in reducing the number and frequency of wastewater and rainwater discharges into the receiving water bodies and improving the effluent quality of unavoidable sewer overflows. <b>Inverted</b> <b>siphons</b> and combined sewer overflows, known as important components and critical spots within drainage systems, are natural targets for upgrading [21]. Thus, for two such sites adapted cleaning devices are developed and tested under Chinese conditions. Checklists for {{operation and maintenance}} are provided and a risk assessment is carried out. In this way, German approaches can be transferred to Chinese boundary conditions {{in order to improve}} hydraulic structures and to assure integrity of sewer systems. An increased performance of the sewer system actively contributes to the prevention of urban floods.|$|R

The 30 mi long South Fork and 20 mi long Middle Fork both rise in the Rocky Mountains just east of Glacier National Park, in the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. [...] Much {{of the water in}} the North Fork is diverted from the St. Mary River through a canal and <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{example of}} such an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> was the 1618 fireplace of Franz Kessler. [...] The fire burned in a ceramic box. Inside the box and behind the fire was a baffle. The baffle forced the fire's fumes to descend behind the baffle before exiting to the chimney. The intention was to extract as much heat {{as possible from the}} fumes by extending the path that the fumes had to follow before they reached the chimney.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sewer pipe}} had been {{recently}} rebuilt into a U-shape {{so that the}} city could expand its underground metro railway system. Usually sewers are built in a slope so that gravity helps move waste along. In {{order to get the}} U-shape to work, an <b>inverted</b> <b>siphon</b> was placed so that fluids could be pushed against gravity. The design was flawed, however. While liquids were successfully pumped through, gases were not, and gas fumes would build up.|$|E
50|$|The Rivervale <b>Inverted</b> <b>Siphons,</b> {{also known}} as the Rivervale Tunnel, are a {{historic}} flood control project in rural Poinsett County, Arkansas. It is essentially a very large concrete culvert, which channels the water flow of Ditch Number 4 under the Right Hand Chute Little River, into which it would normally drain. It is located just off Arkansas Highway 135 in northeastern Poinsett County, near its junctions with County Roads 87 and 112. Built in 1924-26, the purpose of the culvert was {{to reduce the amount of}} water carried by the Right Hand Chute during major flooding events by diverting the volume of Ditch Number 4 further downstream. As part of a robust series of flood control works, it helped stabilize flood management in the area so that further economic development could take place.|$|R

Sections at road and rail crossings had reinforcing steel. Siphon crossings of rivers were made as reinforced round concrete tubes. The interior dimensions of the aqueduct were selected so that no internal pressure {{was developed by the}} water flow; nineteen different interior sections were required. For inspection and maintenance, manholes were provided at approximately 1 mile intervals, which allow insertion of a small boat for inspections. Vent pipes in the manholes allowed controlled entry of air.|$|R
