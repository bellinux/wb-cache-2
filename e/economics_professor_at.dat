25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of a list that also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, an <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina. The rebuilt side came close to winning the title, but just missed out. Ribbeck's tactics, which were felt to be overly negative, were blamed for this, and when the following season looked to be going no differently, Beckenbauer dismissed Ribbeck and took control of the team himself. An immediate upturn in form saw Bayern take that year's title.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact of a professor’s appearance, as rated by students, on his or her salary, {{controlling}} for research and teaching productivity. We also estimate the impacts of a professor’s appearance on the quality of his or her teaching, as evaluated by students, and the impact of appearance on research productivity, as measured by citations, publications, co-authorship, and grant funding. Our study is based on data describing <b>economics</b> <b>professors</b> <b>at</b> sixteen universities. Although a relatively small proportion of our sample is rated “hot” by students, hotness generates, for some, a significant earnings premium, even with comprehensive controls for productivity. We find a strong relationship between hotness and teaching productivity, but a much weaker relationship between hotness and research productivity. ...|$|R

2500|$|Robert Barro, an <b>economics</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> Harvard University (author of the 1974 Ricardian {{equivalence}} hypothesis postulating {{that government}} stimuli are inefficient {{in a perfect}} market), argued that US stimulus spending might be unwise because {{of one of the}} factors the US stimulus package depended on for its effectiveness, the [...] "multiplier effect". The fiscal multiplier, required to be over the value of one for the effect to take place, was in practice close to zero – not 1.5 as he said the Obama team were assuming – which means the extra employment generated by the stimulus would be cancelled out by less output and investment in the private sector.|$|E

However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.|$|E
