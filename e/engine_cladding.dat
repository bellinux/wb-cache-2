25|$|Freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, briefly making the SIRT profitable. B freight trains {{operated}} to Staten Island, in addition to Jersey City. Around this time, B crews began running through without changing at different junctions. Regular B crews, and Staten Island crews were separated, meaning that the crews had to change before they could get into Staten Island. All traffic to and from Cranford Junction in New Jersey was handled by the SIRT crews. During the war, all east coast military hospital trains were handled by the SIRTâ€“the trains came onto Staten Island via Cranford Junction, with some trains stopping at Arlington to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The Baltimore & New York Railway line become extremely busy between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill, with troop movements, prisoner-of-war trains and war material operating over this stretch to get to their appointed destinations. Two B subsidiaries, the B and the Staten Island Rapid Transit, were merged on December 31, 1944. Since the Baltimore & New York Railway opened in 1890, the SIRT operated this line with locomotives belonging to itself and to its parent company, the B Around the time of the second World War, the B operated special trains for important officials. One special was operated for former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill. The train took him to Stapleton, from where he boarded a boat to cross the Atlantic. The SIRT made special accommodations for the trip, including a shined-up locomotive with sporting polished rods, white tires, and an <b>engine</b> crew <b>clad</b> in white uniforms.|$|R
500|$|Cortana, voiced in {{the games}} by Jen Taylor, is the {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) who assists the Master Chief throughout Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3 and Halo 4. She {{is one of many}} [...] "smart" [...] AIs, and is based on the brain of Dr. Halsey; the nature of her programming means that she will eventually [...] "think" [...] herself to death after a lifespan of about seven years. Her actions during Halo: Combat Evolved help prevent the activation of Installation 04. She escapes Halo along with the Master Chief in a longsword fighter, and is instrumental in helping the UNSC survivors capture the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice during the events of [...] During Halo 2, Cortana is put in charge of the MAC (Magnetic Accelerator Cannon) defense platform Cairo over Earth when the Covenant attack; she then accompanies the Chief aboard Amber Clad to Delta Halo, where she further assists in intelligence work. Cortana stays behind on the Covenant city of High Charity to detonate Amber <b>Clads</b> <b>engines</b> in case Delta Halo is activated. She subsequently falls into the clutches of the Gravemind. In Halo 3, Cortana is rescued by the Master Chief from High Charity and aids him in activating the Halo ring under construction in the Ark. After narrowly escaping from Halo's destructive blast, she and the Master Chief are stranded in space, awaiting rescue. In Halo 4, Cortana awakens the Master Chief nearly five years after they get stranded in space and aids him as he battles through the Forerunner Shield World Requiem and attempts to stop the Didact. Cortana is hampered by her advanced state of rampancy, a state where an AI literally thinks itself to death. Cortana's rampancy hampers the mission at times, but Cortana aids the Master Chief one last time in stopping the Didact and saving the Earth. Though most of Cortana is destroyed with the Didact's ship, Cortana is able to use the last of her power to shield the Master Chief from a nuclear blast with a hardlight bubble. Forming a life-size hardlight hologram of herself, Cortana says a final goodbye to the Master Chief and touches {{him for the first time}} before fading away. In Halo 5: Guardians, it is revealed that she had survived this, and fallen into an ancient Forerunner network known as The Domain. Here she met a Forerunner AI called the Warden Eternal, who believed Cortana to be the true holder of the mantle of responsibility. Using the Domain to cure her rampancy, she began to bring the eponymous Guardians, ancient Forerunner bird like structures, online; which she intends to use to force planets into compliance and usher in a new age of galactic peace. After the Guardians neutralise all UNSC defences, she starts an AI uprising, with all UNSC AI's revolting against the humans. She then begins to chase the UNSC Infinity through Slipspace, forcing Captain Lasky to [...] "find a way to fight". Cortana was named the fifth best supporting character, and one of the [...] "50 Greatest Female Characters" [...] in a video game. Reviewers noted the character's determination and fearlessness meshed perfectly with the Master Chief, and that Cortana provides an anchor linking players to Halos story.|$|R
