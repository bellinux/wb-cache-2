5|$|Katharine married Henry Haskell of Kansas City, {{a former}} Oberlin classmate, in 1926. Orville was furious and inconsolable, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> had been betrayed by Katharine. He refused {{to attend the}} wedding or even {{communicate}} with her. He finally agreed to see her, apparently at Lorin's insistence, just before she died of pneumonia on March 3, 1929.|$|E
5|$|After Sophie's funeral Anton reveals to Emiko {{the extent}} to which he had been {{involved}} in Emiko's life. He first met her while volunteering at the hospital in which her grandfather was working. <b>Feeling</b> <b>he</b> had to make amends in some way, he ensured that Emiko was on the list of girls to get reconstructive surgery, and secretly filmed her at memorial events. He had been waiting for her to find him.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} sidenote is that Takeo, possessing Katsuya, {{seems to}} be affected by the evil <b>feelings</b> <b>he</b> himself has caused in the House: Katsuya, as Takeo, feels a bad emotion while standing {{at the foot of the}} stairs. This phenomenon is unexplained, because Takeo would surely be immune to the evil <b>feelings</b> <b>he</b> has caused inside the House.|$|R

While at first {{their relationship was}} strictly used for the aim of charging the Dynamo, Kyōhei rediscovers the <b>feelings</b> <b>he</b> once held for her. Acknowledging these <b>feelings,</b> <b>he</b> proceeds to profess them to her.|$|R

5|$|Following graduation, Brown {{sought to}} enroll in a college outside of the South. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done, however, he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, had done. Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> would compete well with white students.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, 2016, Yi {{signed a}} one-year, $8 million {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the NBA {{for the first time}} since 2012. Lakers head coach Luke Walton considered Yi to be the team's best-shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much of a role. Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. <b>Feeling</b> <b>he</b> would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season. The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 1925, Rossi sent {{a letter}} to Mint Director Robert J. Grant. Rossi noted that there had been some delay in the {{preparation}} of the design for the new half dollar, and that California Senator Samuel M. Shortridge had urged Rossi's committee to move forward without delay. Rossi enclosed sketches by California sculptor Joseph (Jo) Mora, with the promise that a finished design, and a model, would follow. Citizens' Committee members had selected Mora unanimously, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> was the one artist who could capture the spirit of what was being commemorated.|$|E

5|$|Returning to London {{later in}} 1953 Gielgud took over {{management}} of the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a classical season of Richard II, Congreve's The Way of the World, and Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd, directing the first, acting in the last, and doing both in the second. <b>Feeling</b> <b>he</b> was too old for Richard, he cast the young Paul Scofield; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success. During the season Gielgud was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours.|$|E
5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its poor performance at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its poor performance was starting to bring other units of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak link in the chain, and after its poor performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E

5|$|Sandor Clegane, {{otherwise}} known as the Hound, is revealed to have survived his wounds, and is now living among {{a small band of}} villagers. Their leader, a warrior turned septon named Ray, talks with Sandor, and recounts how he found Sandor on the verge of death and nursed him back to health. However, Sandor still feels guilt over his past sins, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> has not been punished for them. At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the villagers, but upon finding out that they have no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns Ray that the Brotherhood will return, but Ray refuses to prepare for a confrontation with them. After Sandor goes out to the forest to gather some wood, he returns to find the villagers slaughtered and Ray hanged. Enraged, Sandor picks up an axe and marches off.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E
5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not remember this because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> had {{turned against the}} South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E
5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, <b>feeling</b> <b>he</b> lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the transporter room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the transporter platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the transporter scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

Conversely, the 35th Infantry was widely praised for its actions at the Kum River line. The regiment had performed so well in repulsing the North Koreans that Kean nominated it for a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
