But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man and to please a woman.

500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with what <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off.

500|$|Scholar Zofia Burr, {{who calls}} Angelou's poetry [...] "unabashedly public in its ambitions", connects Angelou's lack of {{critical}} acclaim {{to both the}} public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Bloom agrees, stating that Angelou's acclaim has been public rather than critical. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Oh Pray, calls it an [...] "unfortunate example {{of the dangers of}} success" [...] and states that Angelou's fame has [...] "muted the private and personal quality that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential to poetry". Critic John Alfred Avant, {{despite the fact that the}} volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, states that Diiie [...] "isn't accomplished, not by any means". Even critics who value poetry as an oral tradition devalue Angelou's poetry; critic Bryan D. Bourn, who praises her for using African oral tradition, states that she [...] "slips into banality when she abandons" [...] them and criticizes her for not catering to poetry critics. Scholar Joanne Braxton asserts that [...] "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou". Burr condemns Angelou's critics for their narrow view of poetry, which has resulted in their negative reviews of her poetry, and for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: [...] "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".|$|E

Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, [...] "I've grown up watching [...] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him... is quite wonderful.

[...] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt [...] "were more graceful" [...] and [...] "completely different from today's actors." [...] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, [...] "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, [...] "mesmeriz audiences" [...] by using hasta mudras (hand gestures).

500|$|Lynsey {{was found}} dead by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). The death sparked a [...] "whodunit storyline" [...] with Mercedes in the frame for her murder. Digital Spy {{explained}} her motives stating, [...] "Mercedes has also become increasingly deranged in recent weeks and wanted to keep Lynsey quiet after she discovered the truth about her stalking of Mitzeee". A promotional image featuring Mercedes was later released by Hollyoaks which confirmed Mercedes as an official suspect in the mystery. Mercedes entered a relationship with Doctor Browning, who had previously paid her for sex, {{in an attempt to}} make Riley jealous. Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she [...] "was nervous about the union of the dark soul mates, Mercy and Browning, but their chemistry is so watchable - that story is pretty dark". Mercedes began to [...] "fall for the charms" [...] of Doctor Browning, believing she had [...] "landed on her feet" [...] when he invited her to a charity ball. Metcalfe commented that Mercedes began to think he could provide her with the WAG life style that she had always wanted. She added that Mercedes still had feelings for Riley and was [...] "being very sneaky" [...] in her attempts to win him back. She explained that Mercedes [...] "still wants Riley back but, as we know, when she has everything she desires, she still craves a bit of danger". Thompson elaborated on this, saying Mercedes [...] "thinks she wants the quiet life with Riley, but Dr Browning offers an exciting alternative for her, he knows what makes her tick, {{and the two of them}} are excited by how dangerous the other is". On Doctor Browning's feelings for Mercedes, Thompson said: [...] "he's fallen for her and will do whatever <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with her. He thinks if he spends enough time with Mercy, he'll win her around". When Doctor Browning witnessed Riley kiss Mercedes [...] "it becomes a question of how much he can take" [...] and he decided he must [...] "make a quick move" [...] to prevent them reuniting. To do this he takes Mercedes to a shooting range, Thompson explained that there she [...] "realises there's an undeniable connection between them". He added that the couple are [...] "kindred spirits" [...] and Mercedes spending time with him made her rethink their relationship. Thompson said [...] "it seemed to be written in the stars that Mercedes and Riley will get back together - but Dr Browning won't let that happen" [...] and to do this he threatened Riley. Thompson claimed that due to Doctor Browning having incriminating evidence showing that Mercedes discharged herself at the time Lynsey was murdered it gives him [...] "real power, she thinks she's in control, but she might just be underestimating Dr Browning..." [...] Metcalfe said that she feels Doctor Browning is Mercedes soul mate, explaining that [...] "he gives as good as he gets and I think that's really good for my character". On who Mercedes loves more out of Doctor Browning and Riley, Metcalfe said [...] "it's Doctor Browning all the way for her, i think he really took her by storm and she absolutely adores him". On 17 August 2012 during E4's first look episode it was revealed Doctor Browning had killed Lynsey. Hollyoaks official website said Doctor Browning's motives in killing Lynsey were [...] "presumably to protect Mercedes".|$|E
