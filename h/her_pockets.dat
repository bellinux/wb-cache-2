2500|$|In the {{presence}} of Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, Mr. Wilson requested Marissa turn out <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and open her wallet. [...] Marissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade. [...] Marissa identified Savana Redding {{as the person who}} had supplied her with the drugs. [...] Wilson did not follow-up with questions to determine when Savana may have given Marissa the pills, where Savana might be hiding drugs, or how Savana had obtained them.|$|E
2500|$|The body, later named [...] "Caledonia Jane Doe" [...] or [...] "Cali Doe" [...] by investigators, {{was fully}} clothed and {{showed no signs}} of sexual assault. She had died from a severe {{hemorrhage}} caused by two gunshot wounds, one to the head over the right eye and one to the back. The wound to the head indicated she had apparently not turned or flinched, as is common when one is shot in the head. Instead, the entry wound suggested complete, if horrified, surprise. <b>Her</b> <b>pockets</b> had been turned inside out, suggesting that any identification she carried had been removed.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{like she}} did before on her {{previous}} projects Sugar & Spice and Beauty & the Streets Vol. 1, Harrison served as executive producer for K.I.S.S which entailed her scouting the producers, songwriters, arranging the album track listing, and {{keeping track of the}} accounting. Her fifth studio album Sugar & Spice was catered more to Japan's distinct sound and market, but approaching K.I.S.S., she wanted to make a classic MÃ½a album even if it meant digging deeper into <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> K.I.S.S. has a balance of mid-tempos, up-tempos, slow jams and great production. [...] "As fun as this album is, there's also lots of substance to be discovered lyrically, without getting bored or depressed", she described. In an interview with 4Eight Media, she said, [...] "The creative process was a combination of including songs that I had in my archive for years in addition to travelling across the U.S. and Jamaica to work with different producers and artists. She chose the songs that best worked together sonically & arranged the track listing of the album accordingly." [...] Harrison used a few songs on the album that have existed in her archive {{for a couple of years}} that finally found the appropriate place to reside. The entire album with the new material took her about 5 months to assemble & complete. Between October 2010 & February 2011.|$|E

2500|$|After telling Atwater {{that she}} would be taken to jail, Turek demanded her driver's license and proof of insurance. When Atwater {{informed}} Turek that her license and insurance card were in her purse that had been stolen a couple of days before, Turek told Atwater that he had [...] "heard that story two-hundred times." [...] Atwater provided her address from her checkbook. Atwater then asked Turek to allow her to take her [...] "frightened, upset, and crying" [...] children to a friend's home just two houses down before taking her to jail, but he refused her request. Turek told her [...] "ou're not going anywhere" [...] and stated that her children could accompany her to the police station. A friend of Atwater's who came to the scene took the children into her care while the officer arrested Atwater. Turek handcuffed Atwater, in front of her two young children, placed her in his squad car, did not fasten her seat belt, and drove her to the police station to be booked. [...] According to the court document, [...] "booking officers had her remove her shoes, jewelry, and eyeglasses, and empty <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> Officers took Atwater's 'mug shot' and placed her alone in a jail cell for about one hour." [...] A magistrate released Atwater on $310 bond. She later paid three $50 fines for each violation of Texas's seat belt law (one for her and each of her children). The charges of driving without a license and without proof of insurance were dismissed.|$|E

60|$|He {{stared at}} her. She {{was dressed in}} a wool jacket and boots, her hands in <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> A cloud of steam came from her mouth and nostrils. Her breast was rising and falling.|$|E
60|$|She rose, {{slipped her}} note-book into <b>her</b> <b>pocket,</b> and drew on her gloves.|$|R
60|$|She fumbled in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> {{and placed}} in his hand a cheap two-bladed clasp-knife.|$|R

60|$|So saying, she {{produced}} {{from one of}} <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> a whisky-flask tightly corked, and of its contents we each took a sip, Mrs. Aleshine remarking that, leaving out being chilled or colicky, we were never likely to need it more than now.|$|E
60|$|On {{the present}} occasion, {{it was the}} old story over again. My sisters had done their best to stop it, and had failed. I {{had no choice but}} to appear on the scene--to begin, perhaps, by boxing her ears: to end, certainly, by filling <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Jillgall {{looked at}} me affectionately, and took the reply out of <b>her</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R

6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust her hands into <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and {{straightened}} up {{to give him a}} piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Janet!" [...] he said, {{and started}} toward her, but got no {{farther than the}} corner of the desk. The sight of her heaving breast, of the {{peculiar}} light that flashed from beneath her lashes stopped him suddenly. Her hands were in <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> [...] "What is it?" [...] he demanded stupidly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will go now and {{see what}} I {{can get out of}} the pussies,' said Peppina, the elder girl, one morning, as she took Lizina's basket and {{fastened}} <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> into her own skirt. 'I should like some of the cats' gold for myself,' she thought, as she left her mother's house before the sun rose.|$|E

6000|$|... "All right." [...] She let go {{and stood}} up. Hendricks lay back against the ground, his eyes closed. Tasso walked away from him, her hands in <b>her</b> <b>pockets.</b> She kicked a rock {{out of her way}} and stood staring up at the sky. The night {{blackness}} was already beginning to fade into gray. Morning was coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said she, [...] "I {{know the}} way." [...] And {{with her hands}} still in <b>her</b> <b>pockets,</b> from one of which {{protruded}} a rolled-up novel, she {{walked down to the}} little stream which ran from the spring, crossed the plank and took the path which led {{by the side of the}} vineyard to Pine Top Hill.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Harker {{began to}} blush, {{and taking a}} paper from <b>her</b> <b>pockets,</b> she said, [...] "Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of today. I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial, {{but there is little}} in this except what is personal. Must it go in?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I think,' said Mrs. Britain, {{applying}} {{herself to}} <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and drawing forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled papers: a very kennel of dogs'-ears: 'I've done everything. Bills all settled - turnips sold - brewer's account looked into and paid - 'bacco pipes ordered - seventeen pound four, paid into the Bank - Doctor Heathfield's charge for little Clem - you'll guess {{what that is}} - Doctor Heathfield won't take nothing again, Ben.' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{some days}} {{the mother and}} her two daughters lived very happily together, for Lizina had given them {{everything}} she had brought away except her golden clothing, for that would not come off, {{in spite of all}} the efforts of her sister, who was madly jealous of her good fortune. The golden star, too, could not be removed from her forehead. But all the gold pieces she drew from <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> had found their way to her mother and sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "I winna {{be called}} the deceased," [...] cried Agnes hotly, {{but she had to}} do as she was bid, and when she emerged, from behind the tree she was the very image of the ill-fated Gavinia. Stroke showed her a plan of Miss Ailie's backdoor, and also gave her a kitchen key (when he {{produced}} this, she felt in <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and then snatched it from him), after which she set out for the Dovecot in a scare about her own identity.|$|E
