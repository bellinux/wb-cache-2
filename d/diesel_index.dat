The major objective of the present investigation is to experimentally access the emission performance of biodiesel and find the optimum blending ratio in a dual cylinder diesel engine used in generating sets and the agricultural applications in India. Diesel; neat biodiesel from neem and their blends (10, 20 and 30 percentage by volume) were used for conducting tests at varying loads. It is observed that thirty percentage neem with diesel blend gives the better emission test (in terms of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, smoke density) than other blend ratios of neem biodiesel. The higher fuel consumption of neem biodiesel is due to higher flash point and viscosity than petroleum diesel. The higher the flash point of the biodiesel, the better atomization process will be performed.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out to evaluate the effect of addition of ethanol to vegetable oil on performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine. Use of straight vegetable oil (SVO) for diesel engine is limited due to their higher viscosity and poor volatility. The SVO shows lower thermal efficiency and higher unburnt hydrocarbon emissions, etc. In long term, SVO exhibits injector coking, fuel pump damage and fuel filter clogging, etc. To reduce the viscosity and to increase the volatility of the fuel, an ethanol is added to the vegetable oil so that thermal efficiency and emissions can be improved. During investigation, blends of vegetable oil with different proportions of ethanol are prepared. Blends BSVO- 80 and BSVO- 70 are prepared using 20 % and 30 % of ethanol with SVO respectively. Basic properties like viscosity, calorific value, specific gravity, etc. are evaluated for all test fuels. The blends of SVO with alcohol show lower viscosity, improved volatility, better combustion and less carbon deposits as compared to SVO. Improvement in brake thermal efficiency, reduction in oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide and smoke emissions are observed with increase in amount of ethanol in blend. The engine performance with the blend BSVO- 70 is in closer approximation with diesel fuel.

40|$|The {{impact of}} H 2 partial {{pressure}} (H 2 pp) during the hydrotreating of heavy gas oil, derived from Athabasca bitumen, over commercial NiMo/¥ã-Al 2 O 3 catalyst was studied in a micro-trickle bed reactor. The experimental conditions were varied as follows: temperature: 360 to 400 ¨¬C, pressure: 7 to 11 MPa, gas/oil ratio: 400 to 1270 mL/mL, H 2 purity range of 0 to 100 vol. % (with the rest either CH 4 or He), and LHSV range of 0. 65 to 2 h- 1. The two main {{objectives of the}} project were to study {{the nature of the}} dependence of H 2 pp on temperature, pressure, gas/oil ratio, LHSV (Liquid Hourly Space Velocity), and H 2 purity. The project was divided into three phases: in phase one the effect of H 2 purity on hydrotreating of heavy gas oil (HGO) was studied, in phase two the nature of H 2 pp dependency and the effect of H 2 pp on hydrotreating of HGO was investigated, and in phase three kinetic studies were carried out using different kinetic models. The objective of phase one was to study the effect of hydrogen purity on hydrotreating of HGO was studied in a trickle bed reactor over a commercial Ni&# 8722;Mo/¥ã-alumina catalyst. Methane was used as a diluent for the hydrogen stream, and its effect on the catalyst performance was compared to that of helium, which is inert toward the catalyst. Furthermore, a deactivation study was conducted over a period of 66 days, during which the catalyst was subjected to H 2 purities ranging from 75 to 95 % (with the rest methane); no significant deterioration in the hydroprocessing activities of the catalyst was observed. Therefore, it was concluded that methane was inert toward a commercial Ni&# 8722;Mo/¥ã-alumina catalyst. However, its presence resulted in hydrogen partial pressure reduction, which in turn led to a decrease in hydrodesulphurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodearomatization (HDA) conversions. This reduction can be offset by increasing the total pressure of the system. HDS, HDN, HDA, and mild hydrocracking (MHC) conversions were studied. Also determined were cetane index, density, aniline point, <b>diesel</b> <b>index,</b> and fractional distribution of the products. The main objective of phase two was to study the effects of H 2 pp on hydrotreating conversions, feed vaporization, H 2 dissolution, and H 2 consumption were studied. The results show that HDN and HDA are significantly more affected by H 2 partial pressure than HDS; with the HDN being the most affected. For instance as the inlet H 2 partial pressure was increased from 4. 6 to 8. 9 MPa HDS, HDN, and HDA conversions increased for 94. 9 %, 55. 1 %, and 46. 0 % to 96. 7 %, 83. 9 %, and 58. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, it was observed that H 2 dissolution and H 2 consumption increased with increasing H 2 pp. No clear trend was observed for the effect of H 2 pp on feed vaporization. In phase three the kinetics of HDS, HDN, and HDA were studied. The power law, multi-parameter, and Langmuir - Hinshelwood type models were used to fit the data. The prediction capacities of the resulting models were tested. It was determined that, while multi-parameter model yielded better prediction, L-H had an advantage in that it took a lesser number of experimental data to determine its parameters. Kinetic fitting of the data to a pseudo-first-order power law model suggested that conclusions on the effect of H 2 pp on hydrotreating activities could be equally drawn from either inlet or outlet hydrogen partial pressure. However, from the catalyst deactivation standpoint, it is recommended that such conclusions are drawn from the outlet H 2 partial pressure, since it is the reactor point with the lowest hydrogen partial pressure...|$|E

The main purpose was the direct detection of HCs in soils. An experiment was conducted between April and May/ 2010 at the State University of Campinas to simulate small pipelines leakages of gasoline and diesel in tropical soils. Leaf and canopy reflectance of Phaseolus vulgaris was obtained using an ASD FieldSpec Hi-Res spectroradiometer, as well as soil spectral data. The range between 1600 and 1800 nm were continuum removed to enhance absorption features of HCs centered at 1730 nm. Additionally, an airborne hyperspectral imaging was performed {{at the end of}} the experiment using the ProSpecTIR-VS sensor, with 357 bands and 1 m spatial resolution. The HC index was applied both to reflectance and continuum-removed reflectance image. The results demonstrate that plants towards senescence display absorption features similar to those typical of HCs.

Traditionally, cylinder’s capacity, rotation frequency, average efficient pressure inside cylinder, piston’s stroke, average piston’s velocity, fuel specific consumption and other indices are used as generalizing criteria, characterizing diesel engine’s efficiency, but they do not reflect interrelation between engine’s complex efficiency and a set of economic, mass-dimensional, operational and ecological efficiency. The approach applied in the article makes it possible to reveal the existing and modify the existing methods of solving the problem of improving diesel engine’s efficiency with due regard to interrelation of the parameters, characterizing efficiency of their operation.

Under modern {{conditions}} the applying methods and design models {{as well as}} the evaluation of the operational characteristics of diesel engines do not completely take into consideration the specifics of the combustion processes. In part, such situation is characterized by the complexity of considering of varied by its nature processes that haven’t been completely investigated. In this context it is necessary to find the new methods and models which would provide relatively simple solutions through the use of integrated factors based on the analysis of parameters of diesel engines. Methodology. The proposed algorithms for the estimating of the combustion process in the form of volumetric and linear velocities is based on the well-known parameters of power and mean effective pressure and allows to compare the efficiency of their behavior in various versions of diesel engines. Findings. The author specified that the volumetric / linear velocity ratio is characterized by some strength and depends on the geometric dimensions of the cylinder-piston group. Due to the assumptions it has become possible to consider the operation of a diesel engine as a system comprising: 1) the subsystem that provides the possibility of obtaining the thermal energy; 2) the subsystem providing the thermal energy transformation; 3) the subsystem that provides the necessary diesel engine power depending on terms of combustion of air-fuel mixture. Originality.
