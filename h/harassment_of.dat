40|$|The article {{deals with}} demographic, social and {{organizational}} characteristics of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment.</b> Many papers analyze these characteristics separately. However, {{according to the}} authors of this article, it is necessary to evaluate a wide context of workplace mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> to determine the factors affecting the occurrence of the phenomenon. The multi-complex approach to the infl uencing conditions is necessary for corporate managers, making preventive and intervention decisions. The research was carried out using the validated questionnaire “The occurrence of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> in relations between employees” in the private and public sector organizations of Lithuania. 1, 231 respondents, who experienced violence in mutual relations, were surveyed. 867 employees distinguished from the respondents experienced mobbing, and 364 employees experienced single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment.</b> The results <b>of</b> this research explain the spread of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> in organizations <b>of</b> different sizes and types, its dynamism. They also allow showing that the unmanaged process has a tendency to intensify over time. Two largest risk zones of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> related to the age and length of service have been highlighted: the fi rst and largest one is a start of professional career; the second is the pre-retirement age. Marital status doesn’t have any statistically signifi cant infl uence on becoming a victim of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment,</b> although a slightly higher number of victims, who are divorced or haven’t created a family, were found. The relationship between the size of the organization and the occurrence of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> was found. The position of the victim <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> and mobbing in the organization is conditioned by systemic causes related to internal conditions determined by the organizational policy. The article presents only a part of the research results. This part of the research allows the formation of socio-demographic view of the victim of mobbing and single cases <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> in the organization, distinguishing the infl uencing factors under individual characteristics. The research was conducted only in one country, so the data should be tested by the cases of other countries...|$|R

The original plan was to attack on June 1–2, but this was canceled due to an impending ceasefire, and re-attempted on June 2–3. The Israelis, under the Givati Brigade's umbrella command, attacked in two main forces: one from the north (3 companies) and one from the south (4 reinforced companies). The Israelis had little intelligence on their enemy and were forced to retreat. They failed to capture territory, and suffered heavy casualties. However, following the operation, Egypt changed its strategy from offensive to defensive, thus halting their advance northwards.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic.

Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E

5|$|On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, {{daughter}} of Count Daniel O'Mahony—a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending {{much of the}} remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife.

Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London. In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered.

5|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks.

5|$|More actions {{took place}} on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; {{together}} Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed {{in the vicinity of the}} Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm. Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his <b>harassment</b> <b>of</b> Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Treuchtlingen on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards Neustadt an der Donau and captured 12,000 Austrians.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany {{followed}} the Nazi takeover. Hitler {{moved quickly to}} eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing <b>harassment</b> <b>of</b> the church in Germany. The treaty required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several high-profile Catholic lay leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The Domestic Violence Prevention Act {{came into}} effect in Japan in 2001, but covers only {{marriage}} partner violence and post-divorce partner violence, and does not recognize intimate partner violence (IPV). The present study was performed to determine the experience <b>of</b> <b>harassment,</b> both toward and from an intimate partner, and recognition <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> as IPV among Japanese university students. Methods A self-administered questionnaire survey regarding the experience <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> involving an intimate partner was conducted as a cross-sectional study among freshman students in a prefectural capital city in Japan. Results A total of 274 students participated in the present study. About half of the subjects (both male and female students) had experience {{of at least one}} episode <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> toward or had been the recipient <b>of</b> <b>harassment</b> from an intimate partner. However, the study participants did not recognize verbal <b>harassment,</b> controlling activities <b>of</b> an intimate partner, and unprotected sexual intercourse as violence. Experience of attending a lecture/seminar about domestic violence and dating violence did not contribute to appropriate help-seeking behavior. Conclusions An educational program regarding harassment and violence prevention and appropriate help-seeking behavior should be provided in early adolescence to avoid IPV among youth. </p...|$|R
