5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph <b>has</b> <b>an</b> even order, and an isolated vertex <b>has</b> <b>an</b> even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph <b>has</b> <b>an</b> odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph <b>has</b> <b>an</b> even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
