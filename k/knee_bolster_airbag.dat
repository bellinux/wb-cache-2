40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of compact cars, safety aspects becomes increasingly important for interior designs. The smaller dimensions of these cars do not only decrease the car mass, but also the energy absorption length, resulting in a more severe crash pulse. As a consequence, the inertia loading on the occupant increases. Belts and airbags used to control the occupant motion, play an important role, but the interior components, like <b>knee</b> <b>bolsters,</b> door panels and seats {{are all part of the}} restraint system.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand the occupant kinematics and injury risks in a light tactical vehicle under frontal crash conditions using a combination of physical tests and computer simulations. A total of 20 sled tests were conducted in a representative environment to understand occupant kinematics, and quantify the effects from occupant body size (5 th/ 50 th/ 95 th), military gear (helmet/vest/varying gear configurations), seatbelt type (5 point/ 3 point), and advanced seatbelt features (pre-tensioner/load limiter) on occupant kinematics and injury risks in frontal crashes. These tests have been used to validate a set of finite element (FE) models of occupants, gear, and restraints. Kinematics exhibited often included submarining due to the lack of <b>knee</b> <b>bolster</b> and the added weight from the military gear. Body size, seatbelt type, and advanced belt features also showed significant effects on occupant kinematics...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to automotive safety systems The industry strategy for automotive safety systems has been evolving {{over the last}} 20 years. Initially, individual passive devices and features such as seatbelts, <b>airbags,</b> <b>knee</b> <b>bolsters,</b> and crush zones were developed for saving lives and minimizing injuries when an accident occurs. Later, preventive measures such as improving visibility, headlights, windshield wipers, and tire traction were deployed to reduce the probability of getting into an accident. Now {{we are at the}} stage of actively avoiding accidents as well as providing maximum protection to the vehicle occupants and even pedestrians. Systems that are on the threshold of being deployed or under intense development include collision detection/warning/intervention systems, lane departure warning, drowsy driver detection, and advanced safety interiors. In this article, Delphi researchers discuss the concept of the safety state diagram, a unified view of the automotive safety system, and the technologies required to implement this vision. Advanced ideas such as pre-crash sensing, anticipatory crash sensing, X-by-wire systems, advanced safety interiors, integrated vehicle electrical/electronics systems, data networks, and mobile multimedia (telematics) are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{absorbing}} {{foam padding}} is widely applied in various areas of modern cars {{in conjunction with}} increasing number of airbags as passive safety systems. High efficient energy absorbing foams {{which can be used}} to optimise energy absorption or minimise packaging space are particularly popular. Foam padding is applied in doors for pelvis and thorax protection, behind headliners for head impact protection, in <b>knee</b> <b>bolsters</b> and under steering columns for knee impact protection, in the foot well area for ankle- and tibia protection and in bumpers to meet competing pedestrian, pendulum and insurance requirements. Since passive safety systems are developed with the aid of modern virtual simulation software such as LS-DYNA, it is imperative to have accurate and reliable material models for the energy absorbing systems used for the said applications. This paper describes the material model validation of high efficient energy absorbing foam based on a test matrix of physical tests. High speed drop tower tests were used to define the basic material model parameters. Sled tests with a rigid impactor shape based on SID IIs, dummy pelvis and head impact tests with a Free Motion Head (FMH) form according to FMVSS 201 U were used to validate the models and assess their accuracy with respect to various complexity of foam sample geometry.

40|$|Injuries to the knee-thigh-hip (KTH) {{complex in}} frontal motor vehicle crashes are of {{substantial}} concern {{because of their}} frequency and potential to result in long-term disability. Current frontal impact Anthropometric Test Dummies (ATDs) {{have been shown to}} respond differently than human cadavers under frontal knee impact loading and consequently current ATDs (and FE models thereof) may lack the biofidelity needed to predict the incidence of knee, thigh, and hip injuries in frontal crashes. These concerns demand an efficient and biofidelic tool to evaluate the occurrence of injuries as a result of KTH loading in frontal crashes. The MADYMO human finite element (FE) model was therefore adapted to simulate bone deformation, articulating joints and soft tissue behavior in the KTH complex. To validate this model, the knee-femur complex response was compared to results of post-mortem human subject (PMHS) experiments where a distributed load was applied to the knee while the femoral head rested on a fixed acetabular cup. The model was also validated against experimental whole KTH response data, in which the pelvis was fixed at the iliac wings and a distributed load was applied to the knee. These experiments showed that the acetabulum is the weakest structure in typical <b>knee</b> <b>bolster</b> loading, followed by femoral head and femoral shaft. The simulations replicated the experimentally observed force-deflection response and predicted the highest stress at the experimentally observed locations of bony fracture. © 2004 SAE International...|$|R

The following approaches are taken; {{a major part of}} the impact energy is to be absorbed by the vehicle structure; the restraint components will provide protection against the remaining crash energy; certain vehicle components are designed to deform under specific types and speeds of impact in a desired mode for sound energy management; structural components such as front side rails, rear rails, door structure and pillars undergo large amounts of deformation; and with properly designed geometry and material these components assist in mitigating the effects of impact...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCrash tests play a {{vital role}} in the design and {{development}} of new vehicles to ensure customer safety. The results obtained from the test programs such as the ones from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are useful for further development of vehicles pertaining to consumer safety. The new and latest oblique offset and small overlap crash tests represent more realistic configurations of the frontal car impact accidents compared to earlier version of standards. In this study, finite element (FE) models of a family sedan car impact surroundings are utilized to reconstruct the tests. The objective of this study is to utilize computational modeling and analysis techniques to assess the performance of a typical sedan car per new small overlap frontal crash test and oblique offset tests, and to compare the results with the original rigid barrier impact crash test in terms of physical intrusion of the vehicle body parts and examining the corresponding potential injuries to occupants. The validation of the models are performed to ensure model accuracy and to check for any abnormalities in the FE models. In this research, the vehicle-to-barrier and vice versa models are simulated using the LS-DYNA nonlinear code. The full frontal impact crash tests are simulated according to the NCAP protocol. The oblique offset and small offset frontal impact tests are then investigated as they represent real-world scenarios better. The data obtained from the intrusions on the vehicle's A- and B- pillars, firewall, toe pan, <b>knee</b> <b>bolster</b> and steering column are analyzed. The results from different scenarios obtained are then compared in terms of intrusion and acceleration inside the car and the analysis of intrusion and occupant injury. It is observed that the small offset crash test adds more challenge not only to the structure of the vehicle but also to the design of seat belts and airbags. This study indicates that the compliance with the offset oblique and small offset frontal impact tests provide the best occupant protection where the occupant sustains maximum G- force especially in terms of head impact protection to the car's A-pillar...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Crashworthiness {{design is}} gaining more {{importance}} in the automotive industry due to high competition and tight safety norms. Further {{there is a need}} for light weight structures in the automotive design. Structural optimization in last two decades have been widely explored to improve existing designs or conceive new designs with better crashworthiness and reduced mass. Although many gradient based and heuristic methods for topology and topometry based crashworthiness design are available these days, most of them result in stiff structures that are suitable only for a set of vehicle components in which maximizing the energy absorption or minimizing the intrusion is the main concern. However, there are some other components in a vehicle structure that should have characteristics of both stiffness and flexibility. Moreover, the load paths within the structure and potential buckle modes also play an important role in efficient functioning of such components. For example, the front bumper, side frame rails, steering column, and occupant protection devices like the <b>knee</b> <b>bolster</b> should all exhibit controlled deformation and collapse behavior. This investigation introduces a methodology to design dynamically crushed thin-walled tubular structures for crashworthiness applications. Due to their low cost, high energy absorption efficiency, and capacity to withstand long strokes, thin-walled tubular structures are extensively used in the automotive industry. Tubular structures subjected to impact loading may undergo three modes of deformation: progressive crushing/buckling, dynamic plastic buckling, and global bending or Euler-type buckling. Of these, progressive buckling is the most desirable mode of collapse because it leads to a desirable deformation characteristic, low peak reaction force, and higher energy absorption efficiency. Progressive buckling is generally observed under pure axial loading; however, during an actual crash event, tubular structures are often subjected to oblique impact loads in which Euler-type buckling is the dominating mode of deformation. This undesired behavior severely reduces the energy absorption capability of the tubular structure. The design methodology presented in this paper relies on the ability of a compliant mechanism to transfer displacement and/or force from an input to desired output port locations. The suitable output port locations are utilized to enforce desired buckle zones, mitigating the natural Euler-type buckling effect. The problem addressed in this investigation is to find the thickness distribution of a thin-walled structure and the output port locations that maximizes the energy absorption while maintaining the peak reaction force at a prescribed limit. The underlying design for thickness distribution follows a uniform mutual potential energy density under a dynamic impact event. Nonlinear explicit finite element code LS-DYNA is used to simulate tubular structures under crash loading. Biologically inspired hybrid cellular automaton (HCA) method is used to drive the design process. Results are demonstrated on long straight and S-rail tubes subject to oblique loading, achieving progressive crushing in most cases...|$|R
40|$|Foot {{and ankle}} {{injuries}} in frontal car collisions {{are believed to}} be caused mainly by occupant contact with the floor and toepan, occupant interaction with the pedals, and the lower leg being deformed between the floor and <b>knee</b> <b>bolster.</b> A better understanding of the causes of foot and ankle injuries is required to design cars for improved safety of the legs. In this study, mathematical models were developed, evaluated by crash tests, and used in parametric studies to examine the factors that influence the injury outcome. The models will serve as a basis for the development of principles for countermeasures effective in a variety of crash situations. Dynamic tests with biological materials were conducted to obtain more information about injury tolerances of the human ankle in dorsiflexion loading. Mathematical vehicle-occupant models were developed in the multi body and finite element software MADYMO. The models were assessed by both crash tests and sled tests. Parametric studies were made using the mathematical models according to statistical methods. Two approaches were used in the mathematical modelling: investigation of the toepan design, and examination of the safety performance of the same car with and without safety systems. All of the toepan design parameters tested were found to have an effect on lower leg responses: the dummy responses also differed significantly depending on the foot position, occupant size and crash severity. To design cars for improved lower leg safety, efforts should be made to reduce the toepan acceleration and intrusion distance in particular. However, the simulations in this study showed that there is an important interaction between the timing of the peak acceleration and the intrusion distance: when the right foot of the driver was resting on the toepan {{at the time of the}} crash, the axial force in the right tibia increased with toepan acceleration; the intrusion magnitude was of minor importance. However, when the right foot rested initially on an accelerator that was displaced during the crash, the axial force increased with the intrusion magnitude, and toepan acceleration was of minor importance. Moreover, this study showed that the local deformation of the toepan is a likely cause of lower leg injuries and must be reduced. The interaction effects of the parameters investigated were also obvious in the examination of safety systems. Although an airbag in the toepan area might considerably reduce the tibial responses, the designers have to be aware that using a foot airbag optimized for a severe crash situation can actually increase the load on the lower leg in less severe crash situations. In this study, the foot-ankle load increased in 50 % of all crash situations. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to measure the occupant size and crash severity and to adjust the airbag inflation in a crash situation. In the biological tests, lower leg specimens were struck at the plantar side of the foot and the ankle responses were measured. The average dorsiflexion angle at the time of injury was 42 ° and the average ankle moment in tests with fractures was 61 Nm. The mathematical modelling techniques used in this study proved to be useful tools for investigating lower leg responses in car crashes. The models developed can simulate the complex shape of toepan intrusion and the interaction between the occupant and the vehicle. The investigation of the causes of injury provided valuable information for designing vehicles with better lower leg safety...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} injuries following car-to-car side collisions. The injuries {{in this type of}} impact have been evaluated to form the basis for the development of test methods and for the principles of protective systems. Side impacts give rise to relatively more severe injuries than frontal impacts. The study has shown that the neck and the legs of the struck side occupant need to be better protected due to a high risk of permanent disabilities. The head, chest and abdomen/pelvis need to be better protected from a risk of life-threatening injuries. It has also been found that chest injuries increase significantly with age. Improved protection in side impacts can be achieved with car body/door reinforcements and compliant <b>bolstering</b> (padding and/or <b>airbag)</b> {{on the inside of the}} door. In order to develop and evaluate the principles of such protective systems a subsystem sled test method that simulates full-scale test conditions has been developed. The BioSid dummy was used. The use of a chest airbag (8 litre and unventilated) resulted in significantly lower loadings to the chest compared to (50 mm thick) compliant chest padding of polyethylene foam type, and significantly lower loadings to the head, neck and abdomen than a stiff reference door. Pelvis padding (75 mm thick) of the same material effectively reduced the pelvic loads. Both the acceleration based chest injury criterion TTI and the deformation based criterion VC were considerably reduced compared to a stiff door. The head ejection through the side window frame was reduced by an average of 30 mm. To further enhance the protection level, the airbag was increased to 12 litres in volume to cover both the chest and the abdomen down to the door armrest level. The effect of bag pressure and bag ventilation was investigated at two side impact severities. The ventilation of the bag reduced the maximum chest deflection by 30 % and the maximum chest viscous criterion, VC, by 50 % (comparison was made with the same bag without ventilation). A suitable initial bag (over) pressure was found to be about 40 kPa, when the loading of the abdomen was also taken into consideration. The deflection based criteria were found to be very sensitive to the door velocity. The stiffness of the bag corresponds to the tolerance level of the thorax of elderly people. The 12 litre ventilated side airbag resulted in 30 - 40 % lower chest deflection and about 60 % lower VC than 50 mm of another compliant chest padding material (Ethafoam 220 of polyethylene foam). TTI was 30 - 45 % lower. The findings from the evaluation of the airbag (size, initial pressure, ventilation) are also applicable to seat mounted side airbags of the type Autoliv has developed together with Volvo. To further improve the protection of the head/neck in side impacts a supplementary protective device "the curtain" at the side window has been proposed. In an investigation carried out together with the Birmingham University it was found that the optimum location for a side airbag sensor is the rear lower quadrant of the front door. A sensor located in this sector would cover almost 90 % of the impacts with risk of AIS 3 + injuries. A pendulum subsystem test method for the evaluation of sensors for side airbags has been developed and validated against low speed full-scale tests. The method has been used for evaluation of a pyrotechnical sensor. The sensor fires at impact speeds above 15 - 20 km/h, when there is a risk of life threatening (AIS 3 +) injuries to struck side occupants and not at low impact speeds (7 km/h), when the risk of injury is minimal. The principle finding in the study was that protective systems in side impacts must be softer than the corresponding human body segments. This was best accomplished with a ventilated side airbag for the chest and the abdomen (down to the armrest level) and padding for the pelvis and the leg. The proposed "curtain" will further enhance the head/neck protection...|$|R
