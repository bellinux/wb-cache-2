500|$|In June 1997, Anggun {{released}} her first French-language album, entitled Au nom de la lune. The album {{was a huge}} artistic departure to Anggun's earlier rock style, experimenting with world music and more adult contemporary sounds. Anggun described the album as [...] "a concentration of all the musical influences of my life. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> Indonesia, but in a progressive way, in a lyric, in a sound, and mainly through me." [...] The album's first single, [...] "La neige au Sahara", quickly became a hit in France, peaking at number 1 on the French Airplay Chart and number 16 on the French Singles Chart. It became the most-played single in France of 1997, {{with a total of}} 7,900 radio airplays, and was certified gold for shipment of 250,000 copies. Two more commercial singles, [...] "La rose des vents" [...] and [...] "Au nom de la lune", were released to modest chart success. The album peaked at number 34 on the French Albums Chart and sold over 150,000 copies in France and Belgium. Anggun received a nomination for the La révélation de l'année award (Revelation of the Year/Best New Artist) in Victoires de la musique (a Grammy Award-equivalent in the French music scene).|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb {{was provided by}} guest star Danny DeVito, an American actor who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording his scenes only instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: [...] "This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> you to...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!" [...] While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got {{to see him in}} action. She thought DeVito [...] "threw his body and soul" [...] into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions {{on a piece of paper}} as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to [...] " [...] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room..." [...] Cartwright said of it: ...|$|E

40|$|This work <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> {{the basic}} {{history of the}} {{political}} communication and political marketing and then to show it on the example of Czech Social-democratic Party (CSSD) and its campaign in the parliamentary election in 2006. In the beginning there is a short overview of theories about political communication and also a chapter about the evolution of political campaigns. In the next part of this work I write about the behavior of voters during the election and what mainly influences it. As a very important topic I find the preelect surveys and how the incorrect interpretation of it can influence or change the voters' choice. Then <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> the CSSD, so I wrote a little about it and about its history and finally there are chapters about the campaign of this party in the parliamentary election in 2006.

40|$|The thesis titled The {{importance}} of picture {{books for the}} first age group of kindergarten children is divided into the theoretical and empirical part. In the theoretical part I define speech and why are books and reading of so much importance in the preschool stage. I also go into detail about the concept of picture books, using the theory of Marjana Kobe especially: how she categorizes picture books and what's her view on them. With books, reading and/or storytelling, we can certainly influence a child's speech development, {{and in the early}} stages of development we can particularly get closer to them with the help of a picture book. The objective of the thesis is to acquaint children with different types of picture books that are suitable for the first age group, and by doing so, I am interested in their feedback. In the empirical part I prepared fourteen different reading events for children. At each of these readings I presented a separate picture book and the reading and/or storytelling was followed by various creative activities from the areas that are in the curriculum. With these reading events, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> children <b>to</b> different types of picture books, as well as to expand their vocabulary and develop a positive attitude towards books. ...|$|R

Resume The main {{target of}} my work was to map {{the history of the}} small sacral monuments (crosses, chapels, statues of saints) in the micro region of Tocnik- Bzova - Brezova - Hredle in area of Horovice. Firstly I tried to {{describe}} this region. I used some examples which would prove that inhabitants of these villages had a lot in common. They had a close relationship, they met each other daily at ordinary affairs or at special times as well. The inhabitants had similar destinies, responsibilities and pas times. The topic was extended to the history of bigger sacral objects in Zebrak and Veliz. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>introduce</b> more themes which were connected with the main topic. Therefore I presented the history of St. Lauren's church and St. Roch's chapel in Zebrak, where the main parish administration was established. The second interesting place - St. John Baptist's church in Veliz was connected with the village Brezova. But the influence of this place was deeper and covered a very wide area. In the theoretic part {{of my work}} I tried to explain what the phrase - small sacral monument means. I described types of these objects and their history. One important thing is also the contemporary statement of these objects and the access for the public. That is the reason why I introduced the groups of volunteers who take [...] .
