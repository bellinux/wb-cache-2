5|$|The {{origins of}} insect flight remain obscure, since the {{earliest}} winged insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> before they evolved to have wings.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{thorough}} examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features, {{it was thought}} to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably Anomalocaris, suggested that it belonged to a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.|$|E
5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E

5|$|The second species, P. blackfeetensis, {{is based}} on a {{specimen}} in the Museum of the Rockies (MOR 454), which was described by another notable paleontologist, Jack Horner. This specimen, and the remains of three or four other individuals, were found in Glacier County, Montana. In this case, the fossils were found in a bonebed of Prosaurolophus remains, which indicates that the animals lived together for at least some time. The bonebed is interpreted as reflecting a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that congregated near a water source during a drought.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a varied}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, {{are the most}} diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis is divided into 3 main sections as follows. Section 1. The external morphology of byssus threads produced by Mytilus edulis and Modiolus modiolus was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Section 2. Several laboratory experiments were performed to determine how sediment with stones at different layers and of different particle size ranges affects byssus thread production. These experiments were: (i) An initial experiment to determine the rate of byssus thread production. (ii) The response <b>of</b> single <b>animals</b> and <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to different particle size ranges of sediment. (iii) The response <b>of</b> single <b>animals</b> and <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to experimental sediments (particle size range < 2. 0 cm) with stones present or not present at different depths. Section 3. Experiments were performed {{to determine the effects}} <b>of</b> single <b>animals</b> and <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> on sediment stability. All experiments were performed under controlled conditions in an experimental sea water flume. These experiments were: (i) the effects <b>of</b> single <b>animals</b> on sediment stability in different particle size ranges of sediment. (ii) the effects <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> on sediment stability in different particle size ranges of sediment. (iii) the effects <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> on sediment stability in sediment of particle size < 2. 00 mm, with stones present or not present at different depths...|$|R
5|$|The <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> he wishes to save.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{dramatic}} loss of any <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> has been to wading birds. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets (Egretta thula), roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens) were hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50years actions by the C further disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.|$|E

25|$|The first scroll, {{which is}} {{considered}} the most famous, depicts various animals (frogs, rabbits and monkeys) frolicking {{as if they were}} human. There is no writing on any of the scrolls; they consist of pictures only. The first scroll is also the largest, with a length of 11 meters (36ft) and 30cm (1ft) wide. As the first scroll is opened, rabbits and monkeys are bathing and swimming in a lake, moving on past the mountains, cliffs and trees are rabbits and frogs making bow and arrows. Further more, more rabbits and frogs are bringing pots and boxes to a (currently) unknown event.

25|$|The horse {{belongs to}} the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses. The perissodactyls arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous–Paleogene {{extinction}} event. This <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> {{appears to have been}} originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes. Other species of Equus are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions.|$|E
25|$|Benign fatty tumors {{known as}} lipomas can {{form on the}} mesentery. As the tumor enlarges, it {{stretches}} the connective tissue into a stalk which can wrap around a segment of bowel, typically small intestine, cutting off its blood supply. The tumor forms a button that latches onto the stalk of the tumor, locking it on place, and requiring surgery for resolution. Surgery involves cutting the stalk of the tumor, untwisting the bowel, and removing bowel {{that is no longer}} viable. If the colic is identified and taken to surgery quickly, there is a reasonable rate of success of 50–78%. This type of colic is most commonly associated with ponies, and aged geldings, 10 years and older, probably because of fat distribution in this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E
