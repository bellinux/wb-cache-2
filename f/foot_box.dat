In 1953, his family moved to Bellaghy, a few miles away, which is now the family home. His father, Patrick Heaney (d. October 1986), was the eighth child of ten born to James and Sarah Heaney. Patrick was a farmer, but his real commitment was to cattle dealing, to which he was introduced by the uncles who had cared for him after the early death of his own parents.|$|E

He describes his parents' different ways of displaying grief, visitors paying their respects, and his encounter of his brother's corpse in its coffin the next morning. The poem focuses on concrete particulars of Heaney's experience and [...] "captures a boy’s unfolding consciousness of death." [...] The final line ("A four <b>foot</b> <b>box,</b> a foot for every year.") emphasizes death's finality.|$|E

50|$|The {{bottom of}} a {{sleeping}} bag typically does not provide significant insulation, because body weight crushes the loft of the insulation material. It is therefore necessary to use a pad or other less crush-able insulation underneath the sleeper, especially in cold weather. Due to this, some sleeping bags do not include insulation on the bottom. Some include a sleeve for holding a sleeping pad. Additionally, some campers, especially ultralight backpackers or hammock campers, have started to use a top quilt, essentially a sleeping bag without a back. Some top quilts include a <b>foot</b> <b>box,</b> while others are just simple blankets.|$|E

50|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{the colour}} vision experiments is depicted in Fig. 1. It was constructed by joining a 5-foot box (AK) with a 2 <b>foot</b> <b>box</b> (KN) at a 100-degree angle. A mirror at M reflects light coming through the opening at BC towards a lens at L. Two equilateral prisms at P diffract light coming from the three slits at X, Y, and Z. This illuminated the prisms with {{the combination of the}} spectral colors created by the diffraction of the light from the slits. This light was also visible through the lens at L. The observer then peered through the slit at E while the operator adjusted the position and width of each slit at X, Y, and Z until the observer could not distinguish the prism light from the pure white light reflected by the mirror. The position and width of each slit was then recorded.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of foot and ankle conditions do not require surgical intervention. For example, several phalangeal conditions may {{be traced to the}} type of <b>foot</b> <b>box</b> used in a shoe, and a change of a shoe or shoe box may be sufficient to treat the condition. For inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) may be used to manage or slow down the process. Orthotics, or an externally applied device used to modify the structural or functional characteristics of the neuromusculoskeletal system specifically for the foot and ankle, may be used as inserts into shoes to displace regions of the foot for more balanced, comfortable or therapeutic placements of the foot. Physical therapy may also be used to alleviate symptoms, strengthening muscles such as the gastrocnemius muscle (which in turn will pull on the heel, which will then pull on the plantar fascia, thus changing the structure and shape of the foot).|$|E

Finally, we hear about a trip to the flax-dam that went wrong. He feels threatened by the frogs and flees.

50|$|Footbag Golf: a game {{in which}} a player must kick the bag towards a {{designated}} target (18 inches in diameter and 18 inches off the ground) while navigating the course. A course is usually made up of 9 or 18 holes, and the distance between the tee and target varies from hole to hole. The game can include any number of players. A player begins a hole by teeing off from a six foot by six <b>foot</b> <b>box</b> by tossing the bag in the air and kicking it with the intention of getting the footbag as close to the target as possible. Where the footbag lands and comes to a complete stop is called the lie. After all players have teed off, the player furthest from the target marks the lie and tosses the bag for another kick. All kicks must be made behind the lie and a player cannot move past the lie until the kick is completed. Once all the players have successfully kicked their bags into the target, they may {{move on to the next}} hole.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the keyboard, processing, computer graphics and interactive pen borrowed from Furse's synthesizer, a QWERTY keyboard {{was added to the}} design and a large one-by-1.5-by-three <b>foot</b> <b>box</b> stored the central processing unit. According to a magazine feature about the Fairlight company, the short length of each sample, which commonly lasted from a half of to an entire second, was the computer's biggest problem; it could only handle a sample rate of 24 kilohertz and a frequency response of ten kilohertz at most, so a sample rate had to be as low as eight kilohertz and a bandwidth of 3,500 hertz for sounds of longer length to be used. However, Vogel has said that the low quality of the sounds was what gave them their own character. Its Music Composition Language feature was also frequently criticized, with reviewers calling it too difficult for empirical users. Other primitive aspects included its limited amount of RAM (208 kilobytes) and its green and black graphics. Nonetheless, the CMI garnered significant attention from Australian distributors and consumers for being able to emulate sounds of acoustic instruments, as well as for its light pen and three-dimensional sound visualization. Still, Vogel was unsure if there would be enough interest in the product. The CMI's ability to emulate real instruments made some refer to it as an [...] "orchestra-in-a-box", and each unit came with eight-inch, 500-kilobyte floppy disks that each stored twenty-two samples of orchestral instruments. The Fairlight CMI also garnered publicity in the science industry, being featured on the BBC science and technology series Tomorrow's World; given that futuristic theories of poor-sounding digital orchestras were also being made, Musicians' Union railed against the CMI who called it a [...] "lethal threat" [...] towards its members.|$|E

40|$|A new highway {{alignment}} for relocated Route 44 in Carver, Massachusetts, {{resulted in}} the direct alteration of 2. 5 acres and indirect alteration of 3. 9 acres of habitat for three statelisted turtle species: the wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), and eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina). As part of the mitigation requirements for impacts to rare species habitat, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) conducted a two year preconstruction study to determine the habitat preferences and seasonal movements of the statelisted species. The study determined that no wood turtles {{were present in the}} study area, that there was a large but declining population of box turtles, and that two highly used spotted turtle habitats would be bisected by the proposed highway entrance ramp. An intermittent stream channel proposed to be piped under the new entrance ramp was identified as a primary travel corridor between the two habitats. Based on the findings of the preconstruction study, MassHighway identified a simple solution to allow the stream channel to continue to provide a migratory corridor for spotted turtles. To achieve this goal, MassHighway increased the proposed culvert size from a 24 inch pipe to a 6 foot by 6 <b>foot</b> <b>box</b> culvert. In {{the spring and summer of}} 2004, postconstruction monitoring was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the culvert as a spotted turtle crossing structure. Nine turtles were fitted with radio transmitters and thread bobbins and followed three times per week in the spring and early summer, and once per week in the late summer to determine culvert effectiveness. Direct evidence (thread trails, visual observation) was documented for seven turtles, and indirect evidence (radio telemetry points on both sides of the culvert, visual observation) was documented for 13 turtles, confirming the use of the culvert as a crossing structure. A future study is recommended to document potential effects of traffic and noise on the spotted turtle population, continued use of the culvert, and potential changes to rare species habitat from the highway construction...|$|E
