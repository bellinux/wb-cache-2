Analysis of the optic pathway may help to clarify the mechanisms involved in grey matter damage in MS. Purpose of our {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between inflammation and neurodegeneration and to achieve evidence of trans-synaptic degeneration in the optic pathway in MS at clinical onset. 50 clinically isolated syndromes/early relapse-onset MS (CIS/eRRMS) with mean disease duration of 4. 0 ± 3. 5 months, 28 MRI healthy controls (HC) and 31 OCT-HC were studied. Ten patients had optic neuritis at presentation (MSON+), 40 presented with other symptoms (MSON-). MRI examination included 3 D-T 1, 3 D-FLAIR and 3 D-DIR sequences. Global cortical thickness (gCTh), pericalcarin CTh (pCTh) and white matter volume (WMV) were analysed by means of Freesurfer on 3 D-T 1 scans. Optic radiation morphology (OR) and volume (ORV) were reconstructed on the base of the Jülich's Atlas. White matter lesion volume (WMLV), OR-WMLV and percent WM damage (WMLV/WMV = WMLV% and OR-WMLV/ORV = ORWMLV%) were obtained by 3 D-FLAIR image segmentation. 3 D-DIR sequences were applied to identify inflammatory lesions of the optic nerve. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) protocol included the analysis of global peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (g-RNFL) and the 6 <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi's</b> sectors (temporal, T-RNFL; temporal superior, TS-RNFL; nasal superior, NS-RNFL; nasal, N-RNFL; nasal inferior, NI-RNFL, temporal inferior, TI-RNFL). The retina of both eyes was analyzed. The eyes of ON+ were further divided into affected (aON+) or not (naON+). No difference in CTh was found between CIS/eRRMS and HC, and between MSON+ and MSON-. Moreover, MSON+ and MSON- did not differ for any WM lesion load parameter. The most significant correlations between RNFL thickness and optic radiation WM pathology were found in MSON+. In these patients, the temporal RNFL inversely correlated to ipsilateral optic radiation WM lesion load (T-RNFL: r - 0. 7, p< 0. 05; TS-RNFL: r - 0. 7, p< 0. 05), while nasal RNFL inversely correlated to contralateral optic radiation WM lesion load (NI: r - 0. 8, p< 0. 01; NS-RNFL: r - 0. 8, p< 0. 01). Our findings suggest that in MSON+ the optic pathway is site of a diffuse pathological process that involves both directly and via trans-synaptic degeneration the RNFL...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi</b> {{with light}} of {{restricted}} spectrum are not new. The object {{of this investigation}} is to evaluate the usefulness of monochromatic light in differentiating between various structures, both normal and abnormal, in the human <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi.</b> Previous work is reviewed and the basic principles involved are presented. Transmittance of the eye and light losses in the eye are considered and known absorption of reflection curves of fundal structures are given since differences in these are responsible for their varied appearance. The initial {{studies were carried out}} using a monochromator and fundus camera system; these were unsuccessful because of inadequate illumination. Ultra-fast film gave results but these were so grainy and lacking in contrast that they were rejected. Later studies utilized narrow pass band interference filters incorporated into the Zeiss Fundus Camera and the results were recorded on fine grain panchromatic film. These were more successful. Colour film offered no advantages since the results were inevitably monochromatic. Visual observation was not used other than to focus the equipment because of the low sensitivity of the human eye at either end of its spectral range. Because of cost photography was chosen in preference to a television system. The results confirm the hypothesis that the appearance of a fundal structure depends upon its spectral characteristics. Monochromatism in itself is not clinically useful and blue light and red light are of only limited value. Monochromatic light between 500 nm and 600 mn produces considerable contrast in the fundus picture and offers information additional to the observed in polychromatic light...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the effect {{and safety of}} intravitreous injection of conbercept(0. 5 mg) on macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion(CRVO). METHODS: According to the selective criteria, from October 2014 to October 2015, 48 cases(48 eyes) of patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO were collected, which were divided randomly into conbercept group(24 cases, 24 eyes) and control group(triamcinolone acetonide 4 mg/ 0. 1 mL, 24 cases, 24 eyes). The best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA), intraocular pressure, intravitreous injection, <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi,</b> central macular thickness(CMT) and related complications were observed before and 1 wk, 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo after intravitreous injection. RESULTS: There was no difference on BCVA, intraocular pressure, intravitreous injection, <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi</b> and CMT {{between the two groups}} before operations(P > 0. 05). There were no significant differences(P > 0. 05) of the BCVA between two groups after treatment for 1 wk, 1, 3, 6 and 12 mo. Before and after treatment, the decrease of CMT in conbercept group was respectively 130. 17 ± 1. 72 μm, 253. 33 ± 3. 14 μm, 318. 00 ± 1. 41 μm, 20. 01 ± 1. 21 μm and 15. 09 ± 1. 41 μm, and no related complications.

40|$|Hubbard {{has found}} that the photoisomerization of retinene was {{important}} for the regeneration of rhodopsin in ¢itro, and the object of the present investigation was to find whether this was also true for regeneration in the living human eye. In the Appendix is described a device which permits the rhodopsin density to be measured by analysing the light reflected from the <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi</b> in an ophthalmoscopic arrangement, the measurement taking about 5 seconds. Now if a blue and a yellow light viewed scotopically are adjusted in intensity so as to appear identical, they must bleach rhodopsin equally, but the blue will be more than 10 times as effective in isomerizing retinene. Therefore if retinene isomerization is important for rhodopsin regeneration, blue light should cause a more rapid regeneration after bleaching, and during bleaching the equilibrium level attained should be less profound. But, as the figures show, the course of bleaching and regeneration is identical for the matched yellow or blue bleaching lights, therefore isomerization of retinene is not important for rhodopsin regeneration in the living human eye...|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} and pregnancy have reciprocal influences between them, therefore {{diabetes mellitus}} may complicate {{the course of}} pregnancy as well as pregnancy can worsen the performance of diabetes especially at the <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi.</b> Several factors seem {{to play a role}} in retinal neovascularization. Actually it’s not possible to understand the mechanisms underlying this progression. Moreover chronic hyperglycemia leads to several events such as: the activation of aldose reductase metabolic pathway, the activation of the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C, the non-enzymatic glycation of proteins with formation of advanced glycation endproducts and the increase of hexosamines pathway. Although every structure of the eye can be affected by diabetes, retinal tissue, with all its vessels, is particularly susceptible. Pregnancy may promote the onset of diabetic retinopathy, in about 10 % of cases, as well as contribute to its worsening when already present. The proliferative retinopathy must always be treated; treatment should be earlier in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. Pregnancy can also cause macular edema; it spontaneously regresses during the postpartum and therefore does not require immediate treatment. In summary, collaboration between the various specialists is primary to ensure the best outcomes for both mother’s health and sight, and fetus’ health...|$|E

The level of these components in the SRF varied over a considerable range. A low level of total protein, sialic acids, and hexosamines was characteristic of patients with relatively recent clinical forms of retinal detachment, following the most favourable course, and with the best response to surgery. Higher indices were found in patients with marked changes in the <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi,</b> gross destruction of the vitreous body, considerable pathology of the crystalline lens, and correspondingly worse response to surgery. As the pathological changes develop in retinal detachment, there is a parallel increase in the protein levels in the SRF. However, exceptions to this rule indicate that the pathological process may vary. An inverse correlation is found between the level of total protein in the SRF and the electrical sensitivity of the retina. A comparison of the biochemical investigation with the clinical examination suggests that the occurrence of retinal tears and the increase of protein in the SRF are due to the same degenerative processes...|$|E

Results: Latanoprost used as monotherapy and as polytherapy renders possible optimal and durable control of intraocular pressure in the form of one antiglaucomatous drug because it can substitute for one or more drugs and obtain the same hypotensive effect. Conclusion: Latanoprost can be described as the ideal hypotensive drug, not only because of its ideal compliance profile (only one daily dose in the evening), excellent hypotensive effect, and, above all, few systemic side effects. © 2012 Pacella et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd...|$|E
40|$|ANY adventurer {{into the}} realms of, {{comparative}} ophthalmology can hardlv fail {{to have had}} his attention attracted by the curious appearance of the <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi</b> of the bird. In the first place the entire absence of any obvious retinal blood-vessels is remlarkable, {{and in the second}} place the optic disc itself presents several points of difference from the mammalian type. The most arresting feature of the ophthalmological picture is the pecten. This appears as a deep black mass, of a velvety texture and very beautifully convoluted. It projects from the optic disc (which is linear, not circular), and extends forwards into the vitreous in {{the lower part of the}} eye, its anterior endc being free. This pecten is found substantially the same in all classes of birds, thouglh it is subject to a great many variations as regards shape, size and number of folds. In its simplest form, without any convolutions at all, it is fotund in the apteryx, the fundtis of which in this respect resembles that of many of the lizards. The function and morphological meaning of this structure have been inquired into from time to time but with very divergent restults, so that the present paper is perhaps justified if only as a consicleration of the various possibilities. group. bmj. co...|$|E
40|$|Migraine with aura (MA) is {{associated}} with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in young women with vascular risk factors (smoke, contraceptive pill). Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has also been associated with MA. We describe a 41 -year-old man, in good health, with MA since 16, familiar history of diabetes, heavy smoker (30 cigarettes/day). Frequency (1 - 2 attacks/year) and clinical features of migraine have been unchanged since the onset. A few days before our examination he suffered a typical migraine attack. In the following hours, however, the headache became more and more throbbing and the aura symptoms (regressed as usual in 30 min) reappeared and persisted, so he went to an Emergency Department. The CT-scan (without contrast) was normal. The following days he had visual disturbances and spatial disorientation. We found a normal neurological examination and <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi.</b> He referred persisting visual troubles. We prescribed MR + angioMR which confirmed a migrainous infarction and ruled out others pathological conditions. Further tests found out dislipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, impaired glucose tolerance. Transcranial Doppler showed right to left shunting. We also prescribed the screening tests for vasculitis (normal). In our opinion this case highlights the relevance of vascular risk factors in MA complications also in male subjects.

40|$|Vigabatrin is {{considered}} the drug of choice for infantile spasms and simple and complex partial epilepsy in childhood. Its mechanism of action relies on the irreversible inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase. Since June 1997 several articles have been published reporting visual field constriction in adult patients on vigabatrin therapy. Recently, 7 pediatric patients, 1 on vigabatrin monotherapy and 6 on add-on therapy with visual field constriction have been described. We have observed 30 pediatric patients with epilepsy (14 boys and 16 girls), ages ranging from 4 to 20 years (mean: 11 years and 2 months) treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms, simple and complex partial epilepsy, who had never complained of ophthalmologic disturbances. Twenty-one patients underwent complete routine ophthalmologic examination (<b>fundus</b> <b>oculi,</b> visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and visual field tests); 9 children (< 6 years old) underwent only fundus examination, because collaboration was lacking. We report on 4 children showing constriction of visual field, prevailing in nasal hemifield. In 1 child, visual abnormalities were stable even 10 months after vigabatrin discontinuation, while in another a greater improvement was observed 5 months after discontinuation. The possible mechanisms have been discussed and the cone dysfunction, connected with GABA augmentation in the outer retina, has been outlined. We suggest a possible protocol to control visual abnormalities in epileptic children...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To examine {{involvement}} of oxidative {{stress in the}} pathogenesis and vascular complications of diabetes. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at the Joint Laboratory Office (JLO), Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, Koshigaya, Japan from April 2010 to December 2011. Fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), serum lipids, urinary albumin excretion (UAE), ankle brachial index and pulse wave velocity were measured in 51 patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy controls. The <b>fundus</b> <b>oculi</b> and Achilles’ tendon reflex were also examined in the patients. Oxidative stress was measured by a reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) test and antioxidant potency was evaluated by a biological antioxidant potential (BAP) test in the Free Radical Analytical System (FRAS) - 4. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed using electron spin resonance (ESR). Results: Diabetic patients tended to have increased ROM compared with healthy subjects, and ROM showed a marked increase with progression of diabetic retinopathy. A significant reduction of BAP was found in patients who were smokers, and BAP was significantly negatively correlated with UAE (p = 0. 029). Serum SOD activity significantly decreased with progression of diabetic retinopathy (p = 0. 017). Conclusion: The FRAS- 4 measurements showed that increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidative potency are linked to deteriorated blood glucose control, heavy smoking, and progression of retinopathy and nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.  </p...|$|E
