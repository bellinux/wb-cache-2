50|$|In the {{open-channel flow}} of {{rectangular}} channels, the alternate depth equation relates the upstream(y1) and downstream(y2) steady-state flow depths of a flow that encounters a control device, {{such as a}} sluice gate, which conserves energy for a <b>given</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|R

40|$|Most funders review more {{proposals}} {{than they}} can recommend for funding. Decision making about what to fund is challenging and so is <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> to hopeful applicants. How do you say yes, or no, so that grant applicants understand your foundation's rationale, feel that they've been treated fairly, and can make realistic plans about their next steps? This guide offers observations and suggestions from funders and grantees to make this task easier and more meaningful. Highlights Reviewing the basic rules Understanding grantseeker expectations Managing your role and the rationale for your decision What's in the Guide? Introduction: For most grantmakers, decision making is always difficult, but <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> {{can be just as}} hard: How do you say Yes or No so that grant applicants clearly understand your rationale, feel that they've been treated fairly, and make realistic plans about their next steps? The Basic Rules: The basic rules of good <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> might look like a matter of simple efficiency and etiquette. But <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> can get complicated in ways that can suddenly make it hard to observe them. The Rationale for Your Decision and Its Implications: In giving Nos, rationale is destiny. If you understand the rationale for your decision clearly, you can understand how much and what kind of effort to make in communicating with grantseekers. Grantseeker Expectations: Grantmakers describe six situations [...] from making site visits to reviewing proposals from friends and former colleagues [...] where understanding the grantseeker's expectations can lead to better <b>decision</b> <b>giving.</b> How Your Institution Shapes Decision Giving: Grantmakers can't unilaterally change their institutions, but they can understand how institutional practices and culture influence their <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> challenges. The first step is to identify the expectations and unwritten rules of your foundation. Your Personal Identity vs. Professional Role: While retreating totally into a professional role would make grantmakers inaccessible and impersonal, ignoring that role can make <b>decision</b> <b>giving</b> too personal [...] creating burdens and dynamics that needlessly complicate the job. The Challenges of Saying Yes: A Yes is often just an early step in a long, possibly complicated relationship between a grantmaker and grantee. Getting that relationship off to a good start, with realistic expectations on both sides, means saying a good deal more than just Yes...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} energy–depth {{relationship in}} open channels with parabolic cross-sections is analytically inverted. Two nondimensional {{expressions of the}} specific energy are considered, depending on the prescribed quantity (specific energy or alternate depth). The inversion of such functions consists of finding the roots of cubic and quartic equations. By solving a quartic equation for a <b>given</b> <b>discharge</b> and for each value of the specific energy, a subcritical depth and a supercritical depth are found analytically. In this case, two acceptable roots are recognized and two other roots are discarded, {{on the basis of}} their physical meaning. Moreover, by solving a cubic equation for a <b>given</b> <b>discharge</b> and for each value of the depth, the other corresponding alternate depth is found analytically. Then, one acceptable root is recognized and two other complex conjugate roots are discarded. Finally, different examples are presented, to show the efficiency of the proposed solutions. Such analytical solutions can be easily used in natural rivers and parabolic channels...|$|R
