5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as <b>dobutamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sympathomimetics such as dopamine, <b>dobutamine,</b> nor{{epinephrine}}, and epinephrine {{used for}} severe hypotension (low blood pressure), cardiogenic shock and septicemia.|$|E
25|$|The inotropic agent <b>dobutamine</b> is advised {{only in the}} {{short-term}} use of acutely decompensated heart failure, and has no other uses.|$|E
25|$|If low blood {{pressure}} persists despite providing {{a person with}} adequate amounts of intravenous fluid, medications that increase {{blood pressure}} (vasopressors) such as norepinephrine and in certain circumstances medications that improve the heart's ability to pump (known as inotropes) such as <b>dobutamine</b> may be given to improve {{blood flow to the}} kidney. While a useful vasopressor, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that dopamine is of any specific benefit and may be harmful.|$|E
25|$|Several radiopharmaceuticals and {{radionuclides}} may be {{used for}} this, each giving different information. In the myocardial perfusion scans using Tc-99m, the radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview, GE Healthcare) or 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) are used. Following this, myocardial stress is induced, either by exercise or pharmacologically with adenosine, <b>dobutamine</b> or dipyridamole(Persantine), which increase the heart rate or by regadenoson(Lexiscan), a vasodilator. (Aminophylline can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole and regadenoson). Scanning may then be performed with a conventional gamma camera, or with SPECT/CT.|$|E

2500|$|These paramedics receive {{additional}} training beyond normal EMS medicine. The Board for Critical Care Transport Certification (BCCTPC®) {{has developed a}} certification exam for flight and ground critical care paramedics [...] Some educational facilities that provide this training are UMBC Critical Care Emergency Medical Transport Program or [...] Individual services such as [...] and [...] have developed 'in-house' advanced practice paramedic providers. These providers have {{a vast array of}} and medications to handle complex medical and trauma patients. Examples of medication are Dopamine, <b>Dobutamine,</b> Propofol, blood and blood products to name just a few. Some examples of skills include, but not limited to, life support systems normally restricted to the ICU or critical care hospital setting such as mechanical ventilators, Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and external pacemaker monitoring. Depending on the service medical direction, these providers are trained on placement and use of UVCs (Umbilical Venous Catheter), UACs (Umbilical Arterial Catheter), surgical airways, central lines, arterial lines and chest tubes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dobutamine.</b> The {{effects of}} {{beta-agonists}} such as <b>dobutamine</b> can be reversed by administering beta-blockers such as propranolol.|$|E
50|$|Examples include denopamine, <b>dobutamine,</b> and xamoterol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dobutamine</b> is a direct-acting agent {{whose primary}} {{activity}} results from {{stimulation of the}} β1-adrenoceptors of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output. Since it does not act on dopamine receptors to induce the release of norepinephrine (another α1 agonist), <b>dobutamine</b> is less prone to induce hypertension than is dopamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dobutamine</b> is a {{sympathomimetic}} drug used in {{the treatment}} of heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of β1 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. <b>Dobutamine</b> was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at Eli Lilly and Company, as a structural analogue of isoprenaline.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of scans are performed using a stress/rest protocol using adenosine as the stressor which acts to induce ischaemia in the myocardium by the coronary 'steal' phenomenon. Some centers use inotrope <b>dobutamine</b> {{to stress the}} heart and the images are interpreted in a similar fashion to <b>dobutamine</b> stress echocardiogram. This article concentrates on adenosine stress scans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dobutamine,</b> a direct-acting beta agonist used in {{congestive}} heart failure, also demonstrates tachyphylaxis.|$|E

50|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} <b>dobutamine</b> is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|In the SURVIVE study, {{despite a}} {{reduction}} in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level in patients in the levosimendan group compared with patients in the <b>dobutamine</b> group, levosimendan did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 180 days.

50|$|Cardiogenic shock may {{be treated}} with {{intravenous}} <b>dobutamine,</b> which acts on β1 receptors of the heart leading to increased contractility and heart rate.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{stimulation}} of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors can produce sympathomimetic effects. Salbutamol is a widely used direct-acting β2-agonist. Other examples include phenylephrine, isoproterenol, and <b>dobutamine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In cardiology, hibernating {{myocardium}} is a {{state when}} some segmentsof the myocardium exhibit abnormalities of contractile function. Theseabnormalities can be visualised with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), nuclear medicine (PET) or ventriculography. Echocardiography: A wall motion abnormality at rest which improves during a low-dose <b>dobutamine</b> stress test is classified as [...] "hibernating myocardium". Low dose <b>dobutamine</b> stimulates contractile function and thus helps to predict functional recovery after revascularization.Cardiac magnetic resonance: The most frequently used MR contrast agents based on Gd-chelates accumulate in the extracellular space which is increased in scarred myocardium. This leads to a signal increase which can be visualised with the [...] "late gadolinium enhancement technique". This {{is probably the most}} accurate way to visualise scarred myocardium. An alternative (or additional) technique with CMR is the use of low dose <b>dobutamine</b> similar to echocardiography.PET: The finding of a perfusion or metabolic mismatch between PET-FDG and PET-NH3 is indicative of decreased metabolism. The wall of the affected segments is hypo-, a-, or dyskinetic.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010 {{dopexamine}} was {{not often}} administered in cardiac care because other, more well established drugs can accomplish the same effect, other such drugs include epinephrine, dopamine, <b>dobutamine,</b> norepinephrine, and levosimendan.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dobutamine</b> is {{predominantly}} a β1-adrenergic agonist, with weak β2 activity, and α1 selective activity, {{although it is}} used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its β1 inotropic effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output. <b>Dobutamine</b> is administered as a racemic mixture consisting of both (+) and (−) isomers; the (+) isomer is a potent β1 agonist and α1 antagonist, while the (−) isomer is an α1 agonist. The administration of the racemate results in the overall β1 agonism responsible for its activity. (+)-Dobutamine also has mild β2 agonist activity, which makes it useful as a vasodilator.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dobutamine</b> is used {{to treat}} acute but {{potentially}} reversible heart failure, such as which occurs during cardiac surgery or in cases of septic or cardiogenic shock, {{on the basis of}} its positive inotropic action.|$|E
5000|$|Use in sepsis {{has been}} {{explored}} in clinical trials, but {{use of an}} inotropic agent like <b>dobutamine</b> or dopexamine did not reduce mortality compared with norepinephrine or epinephrine. [...] Use of dopexamine may be harmful in sepsis ...|$|E

50|$|For example, cardiac decompensation may {{refer to}} the failure of the heart to {{maintain}} adequate blood circulation, after long-standing (previously compensated) vascular disease (see heart failure). Short-term treatment of cardiac decompensation can be achieved through administration of <b>dobutamine,</b> resulting in an increase in heart contractility via an inotropic effect.|$|E
50|$|An antihypotensive agent, {{also known}} as a {{vasopressor}} agent or , is any medication that tends to raise reduced blood pressure. Some antihypotensive drugs act as vasoconstrictors to increase total peripheral resistance, others sensitize adrenoreceptors to catecholamines - glucocorticoids, and the third class increase cardiac output - dopamine, <b>dobutamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|A cardiac {{specific}} radiopharmaceutical is administered. E.g. 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview, GE healthcare), 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb now Lantheus Medical Imaging).

50|$|The Gorlin {{equation}} {{is related to}} flow across the valve. Because of this, the valve area may be erroneously calculated as stenotic if the flow across the valve is low (i.e. if the cardiac output is low). The measurement of the true gradient is accomplished by temporarily increasing the cardiac output by the infusion of positive inotropic agents, such as <b>dobutamine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The enquiry {{decided that}} DECREASE II {{need not be}} {{retracted}} because it believed that <b>Dobutamine</b> Stress Echo, {{the subject of the}} study, was no longer used in hospitals. This belief appears to be incorrect. DECREASE VI led to two publications, which were also not retracted. No other researchers were disciplined in this inquiry. The Committee informed all parties involved in the funding of the project.|$|E
