Then in Jang Joon-hwan's Save <b>the</b> Green Planet! <b>in</b> 2003, he played a mentally unbalanced man who believes that aliens are plotting to invade the earth.

25|$|High {{variable}} costs mean that Pandora {{does not have}} significant operating leverage, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates.|$|R

Armyworm pheromone traps monitored by the University of Kentucky have been catching an impressive early moth flight for several weeks. Doug Johnson, UK Extension Entomologist, has been helpful in disseminating this information to alert of the potential impact this may have on hay, small grain, and corn crops. Very soon, grassy crops in extreme southern Indiana should be monitored for leaf defoliation and small armyworm larvae hiding under the soil surface residues during the day. This is especially true where grass-hay and wheat are thick and lush, this presents a favorite egg-laying location for moths.

As Olaf Thon and Stefan Reuter were the most prominent newcomers, hopes were not high, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years two more championships were won.

It's a no-brainer. Look at how these movies have done, superhero movies that have gone dark, and there hasn't been one darker than Spawn. If we do it like we want to, it could be a game changer. I think Todd feels the same way as me — that we go R. Not a kinder, gentler Spawn, we go straight R — like pushing it, pushing NC-17. Give the fans what they expect. That edge brought comic book to where it is. I would really like to show what that character can be.|$|R

50|$|The Chicago 2016 Olympic {{organizing}} committee had advocated {{a plan to}} construct the Olympic Village on the Michael Reese site as a reuse project, should Chicago be awarded the Games.

Under the new plan, the City would borrow $85 million to buy the Michael Reese Hospital campus from its then owner, Medline Industries. Medline would have received $65 million because the company agreed to make a $20 million charitable contribution back to the city.
