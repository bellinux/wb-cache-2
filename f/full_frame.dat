5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original <b>full</b> <b>frame</b> and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E

50|$|When editing 24pA footage, {{conversion}} from 60i back to {{the original}} 24p is very efficient. It only requires blending the fields made from the <b>frames</b> back into <b>full</b> <b>frames.</b> Then, only every fifth frame will be made up of fields from two different frames, and that frame can be discarded, leaving only the other four <b>full</b> <b>frames.</b> In order for this to work properly, the DVX100 camera records video in chunks of five video frames. This ensures that each clip has regular and predictable cadence.|$|R
5000|$|Some kinescopes filmed the {{television}} pictures {{at the same}} frame rate of 30 <b>full</b> <b>frames</b> per second, resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second. The standard was later changed for color TV to 59.94 fields/s. or 29.97 frame/s. when color TV was invented.|$|R

The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in <b>full</b> <b>frame.</b> The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact.

500|$|For the new pilot, Fox made {{it clear}} that they would not air the episodes in the {{widescreen}} format. Whedon and company felt they had to [...] "serve two masters" [...] by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release, but keeping objects in frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan <b>full</b> <b>frame.</b> To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of [...] "found footage", with deliberately misframed or out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: [...] "...don't be arch, don't be sweeping—be found, be rough and tumble and docu and you-are-there". Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera. This style was not used, however, when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the Firefly universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, David Boyd, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced lens flare in exchange for cheaper ones.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was going to be like. Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either <b>full</b> <b>frame</b> or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, you feel you must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation version {{received}} positive reviews. Edge {{praised the}} improved damage system {{resulting from the}} new physical modelling routines, saying the crashes are much more intense than the original. The 3D engine was described as [...] "impressive", {{but the lack of}} a link-up multiplayer mode was criticised. Ed Lomag of Computer and Video Games lauded the improved car mechanics and track design and also liked that the UK PAL version runs in full screen at a <b>full</b> <b>frame</b> rate, thus proving British developers could make decent British PlayStation games. Despite these compliments, he criticised the game's limited re-playability. The Electric Playground complimented the scenery and damage effects. Game Revolution described the Stock Car Racing as [...] "almost perfect", and the tracks as [...] "extremely cool", but criticised the steering sensitivity. Absolute PlayStation described the game as a [...] "vast improvement" [...] over the original, but said the gameplay is identical and [...] "rather shallow". IGN believed that the game compensates too much for the lack of difficulty of the first game through an overly aggressive artificial intelligence and by making it [...] "impossible" [...] {{to catch up with the}} other cars. Despite this, they praised the car physics and graphics. Jeuxvideo.com praised the playability of the game and the soundtrack, but criticised the commentary as [...] "repetitive". Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa described the graphics as [...] "top notch", but also said that it breaks what was good in the original game. Andrew Collins of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine believed the features are [...] "massively improved" [...] over the original, and said its [...] "superbly polished" [...] gameplay made it one of the best PlayStation racing games. His main criticism was that he thought the Destruction Derby Practice mode can make players complacent.|$|E

"Full-frame" [...] is {{the same}} size as 35mm film (135 film, image format 24×36mm); these sensors are used in DSLRs such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, 5DS/5DSR, 5D Mark IV and 6D Mark II, and the Nikon D5, D810, D750, D610 and Df. Most modern DSLRs use a smaller sensor that is APS-C sized, which is {{approximately}} 22×15mm, slightly smaller than the size of an APS-C film frame, or about 40% of the area of a full-frame sensor. Other sensor sizes found in DSLRs include the Four Thirds System sensor at 26% of <b>full</b> <b>frame,</b> APS-H sensors (used, for example, in the Canon EOS-1D Mark III) at around 61% of <b>full</b> <b>frame,</b> and the original Foveon X3 sensor at 33% of <b>full</b> <b>frame</b> (although Foveon sensors since 2013 have been APS-C sized).

2500|$|Interlace, no {{dependence}} upon sync, and interline reconstruction {{gives the}} AVT modes a better noise resistance {{than any of}} the other SSTV modes. <b>Full</b> <b>frame</b> images can be [...] reconstructed with reduced resolution even if as much as 1/2 of the received signal was lost in a solid block of interference or fade because of the interlace feature. For instance, first the odd lines are sent, then the even lines. If a block of odd lines are lost, the even lines remain, and a reasonable reconstruction of the odd lines can be created by a simple vertical interpolation, resulting in a <b>full</b> <b>frame</b> of lines where the even lines are unaffected, the good odd lines are present, and the bad odd lines have been replaced with an interpolation. This is a significant visual improvement over losing a non-recoverable contiguous block of lines in a non-interlaced transmission mode. Interlace is an optional mode variation, however without it, much of the noise resistance is sacrificed, although the synchronous character of the transmission ensures that intermittent signal loss does not cause loss of the entire image.|$|E
