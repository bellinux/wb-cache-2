50|$|Historically, many {{evolutions}} of {{the world}} wide web have been adopted and used in internal webs. Just like the web evolved from a text-based system to a web of multimedia and online services, intrawebs now include multimedia resources and, for instance, corporate forms moved from online static copies to dynamic front-ends of web applications directly linked to the corporate information system. Even latest web tools meet application scenarios on corporate webs: wikis can be used to edit and maintain corporate documents and directories in a very simple way, blogs can be used for news and technological watch, web services are being used to allow enterprise application integration and workflow management, semantic web frameworks are used for information and data integration and exchanges for instance to materialize corporate memories as corporate semantic webs, etc.Intrawebs are webs dedicated to the community of a corporation. Being on a private network of the company, intrawebs can include a whole family of applications that could not be made available on the public web for confidentiality reasons: corporate applications. The corporation is an existing community that needs to set up and maintain collaboration to attain professional objectives. Web technologies propose shared application supporting communities of practice, of interest, and more generally speaking, knowledge management. They can support collaborations: synchronous communication, expert matching, internal FAQ, collaborative document edition, case-based memories, project management, workflows, etc. Within a company the existence of such community and of its shared professional interests makes the intraweb a selected place to develop and <b>experiment</b> <b>new</b> web-based solutions.Historically {{there has always been a}} synergy between World Wide Web evolutions and intra-webs experiments. Many evolutions of the World Wide Web have been adopted and used in internal webs and, vice versa, many local initiatives on intrawebs turned out to be seeds of new web applications.|$|E
