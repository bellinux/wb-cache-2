5|$|Red foxes may prey on <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> and {{guinea pigs}} {{if they are}} kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes {{frequently}} encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

40|$|During {{the course}} of certain {{experiments}} concerning the mechanism of the "masking " of the papilloma virus in the <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit,</b> it was thought of importance to determine {{from the moment of}} inoculation to the appearance of papillomas the quantitative changes of virus inoculated into the skin of the <b>domestic</b> and cottontail <b>rabbit.</b> It seemed to be of particular interest to know: (a) The rate at which the inoculated virus disappears or is inactivated at the site of inoculation in the skin of the <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit.</b> (b) Whether the active virus persists at the site of inoculation during the whole incubation period in the cottontail rabbit or disappears for a time only to reappear in the developing papillomas.

2500|$|After many <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> starved and the {{remaining}} ones were eradicated by biologists in 1923, the ducks began to recover, increasing to {{a population of about}} 500 individuals by the 1950s.

40|$|The results {{obtained}} by a fluorescent antibody {{study of the}} Shope papilloma virus in papillomas of the wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit</b> are presented. In the wild rabbit papillomas the viral antigens occurred exclusively in the nucleus and {{were present in the}} differentiating cells of the keratohyaline layers and in the keratinized layers. The antigens were not present in the deeper proliferating epithelial cells of the papillomas. The Shope viral antigens were present in very minute amounts in papillomas of the <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit,</b> as compared with papillomas of the wild rabbit, and were only detected in the superficial keratinized layers. It is postulated that virus is present in the nuclei of the proliferating cells of the papillomas of the wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbit</b> but exists there in an early stage of development, consisting mainly of nucleic acid and deficient in protein, therefore non-antigenic and not demonstrable by fluorescent antibody. The nucleic acid moiety of the virus may be infective, and the protein component may provide immunologic specificity and serve to preserve transmissibility. The protein-deficient virus can be referred to as masked virus...|$|R

Legume hays are higher in protein, calories, and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones and loose stool. This type of hay should be reserved for young kits or lactating does.|$|R
