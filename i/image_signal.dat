25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the image frequency are, the more the bandpass filter will attenuate any interfering <b>image</b> <b>signal.</b> Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the image frequency is , a higher intermediate frequency improves image rejection.

30|$|Over {{the recent}} years, multirate filterbanks have found {{applications}} in speech processing, image processing, communications, radar systems, etc. [1, 2]. The structure of uniform filterbanks is generally {{composed of two}} parts: an analysis and a synthesis filterbank. Filterbanks help split a signal into two or more subbands, decimate each subband signal, and allocate bits for samples in each subband, which is the basic principle of subband coding for speech and <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> [1].

40|$|Compressive Sampling (CS) is an {{emerging}} theory which points us to a promising direction of designing novel efficient data compression techniques. However, {{due to the}} complex nature of the natural <b>images</b> <b>signals,</b> the indiscriminate sampling scheme of conventional Compressive Sensing cannot sufficiently capture the important information of <b>image</b> <b>signals,</b> and as a result, the performance of Compressive Sensing drops greatly. The conventional Compressive Sensing {{is based on the}} assumption that we do not have any prior knowledge about the target signal. Therefore, an incoherent sampling scheme is a reasonable choice. However, for <b>image</b> <b>signals,</b> the knowledge about its spectrum characteristics is accessible, which enables us to adjust the conventional Compressive Sensing framework to achieve better performance by taking advantage of the prior knowledge. Based on this observation, we propose two reweighted Compressive Sensing frameworks which introduce weighting schemes into the measurement process. We developed two approaches of designing the weighting matrix from the perspectives of the human eye perception and the image spectrum statistics respectively. By utilizing the proposed weighting scheme, we can adjust the behavior of the measurement process to capture more information from the important frequency components; furthermore, our proposed weighting scheme can also improve performance of the optimization process in the reconstruction stage. Experiment results indicate that both of the proposed weighting schemes considerably enhance the performance of Compressive Sensing on <b>image</b> <b>signals</b> without increasing the size of measurements or computation complexity, while they can still keep the advantages of random sampling in the conventional Compressive Sensing framework...|$|R
