5|$|The family's {{domestic}} {{peace was}} shattered when Hogg's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, {{the son of}} Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union. Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier, but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{contains}} masochistic themes {{and tells the}} story of heartbreak caused by a failed relationship: [...] "Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash". The chorus has Mars singing, [...] "I'd catch a grenade for ya," [...] and speaks of unrequited love when the subject girl of his affections [...] "won't do the same". Tim Byron, writer for The Vine, [...] "'Grenade' is about the feeling of [...] ". The critic added, [...] "Mars knows she is bad for him, that's she's preventing him from thinking straight, that he can't actually have <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he wants, but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her." [...] As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul: [...] "'Grenade' represents the OTHER side of love– where you're in love with a woman and you {{know for a fact that}} she doesn't love you the way you love HER." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{production}} proceeded smoothly {{it was not}} without some unusual aspects. The first was the helpfulness of Cary Grant toward Ingrid Bergman, {{in a way that}} [...] "was remarkably calm and pointedly unusual for him." [...] Although this was Bergman's second outing with Hitchcock (the first was the just-finished Spellbound), she was nervous and insecure early on. The often moody, sometimes withdrawn Grant, though, [...] "came to Notorious full of bounce" [...] and coached her through her initial period of adjustment, rehearsing <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Devlin rehearses Alicia. This began a lifetime friendship for the two.|$|E
2500|$|Lange {{made her}} {{professional}} film debut in 1976's King Kong, beating out actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn {{for the role}} of damsel in distress. [...] Despite being a box-office success – it became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 – and receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Special Effects, the film and her performance were widely panned. However, renowned film critic Pauline Kael praised her, noting, [...] "The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange's fast yet dreamy comic style. [...] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in My Man Godfrey, [...] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they're in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like <b>her,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people liked Lombard." [...] Lange {{went on to win the}} 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She would remain a favorite of Kael's, who would later comment, [...] "She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{the sheer}} size of Callas's instrument, Celletti says, [...] "Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it {{frequently}} contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium." [...] Rodolfo Celletti wrote that Callas had [...] "a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice" [...] ("una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro"). After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that [...] "she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience." [...] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, [...] "But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of <b>her,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, {{at the bottom of the}} range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top." [...] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas's pre-1954 voice was a [...] "dramatic soprano with an exceptional top", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia, a [...] "huge soprano leggiero".|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt <b>her</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E
