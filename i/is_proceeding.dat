25|$|Cricket imposes {{penalties}} on captains {{if their}} players bowl their overs {{at a very}} slow rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team <b>is</b> <b>proceeding</b> slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skillful bowler to avoid penalties that {{are perceived to be}} greater, such as being banned or losing points.|$|E

Insurance coverage for low-income individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who don't have health insurance are required to purchase it. (The health insurance market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, no one can be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new universal coverage law, <b>is</b> <b>proceeding,</b> as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|Other sonars {{such as the}} {{airborne}} sonar Mihir are in trials, whilst work <b>is</b> <b>proceeding</b> apace on {{a new generation of}} sonars. Sonars may be considered one of DRDO's most successful achievements as the Indian Navy's most powerful ships rely on DRDO made sonars. The standard fit for a front line naval ship would include the HUMSA-NG hull mounted sonar and the Nagin towed array sonar. The Mihir is a dunking sonar meant for use by the Naval ALH, working in conjunction with its Tadpole sonobuoy. The Panchendriya is in production for the Kilo class submarine upgrades.|$|E
25|$|The line's railway {{signaling}} {{system is designed}} to ensure that trains wait on the double track section while a train <b>is</b> <b>proceeding</b> {{in the other direction}} on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points.|$|E

25|$|In February 2014, Airbus Helicopters {{announced}} at Heli-Expo 2014 {{the development of}} an improved variant, the EC225e. The EC225e features numerous changes including new avionics systems, such as the TCAS II collision avoidance system, an automatic identification system, and a specialized rig-approach system; it was also intended to feature an improved Turbomeca Makila 2B engine to increase the EC225e's maximum takeoff weight by 550kg, and an additional fuel tank in the rear baggage compartment to extend its range to 300 nautical miles with up to ten passengers on board. Some, but not all, modifications can be retrofitted onto existing EC225s. In the same announcement, in February 2014, Lease Corporation International said that they had placed a $645million order for 15 EC225e (along with 6 Airbus Helicopters EC175) helicopters as the launch customer. In February 2016, the Makila 2B engine was dropped from the EC225e as a cost reduction measure, development of the other structural and avionics aspects <b>is</b> <b>proceeding.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cruise {{shipping}} {{has become}} an essential industry at the port and a major driver of investment in M치laga. In 2012 there were 651,517 passengers visiting the city onboard cruise ships calling at the port, including those who started or ended their cruise in M치laga. Meanwhile, the regular line of coast trade between M치laga and Melilla moved around 303,369 passengers, {{for a total of}} approximately 942,214 passengers traveling to, from or through the port. The development of the cruise industry <b>is</b> <b>proceeding</b> with a new passenger terminal, port museum and environmental education centre planned for inclusion in the cruise ship facilities at Quay 2. A commercial marina will also operate from Quay 1, catering to 24 super-yachts of up to 30 metres, and the Eastern Quay passenger terminal will be remodeled to improve pedestrian access and double existing capacity to 560,000 passengers a year. The quays are connected by a system of internal roads and a network of internal and external railway lines. The internal rail network links the Harbor Services Area with the M치laga main rail station.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} F-16's which are due to be delivered to the Iraqi Air Force throughout the upcoming years, 24 KAI T-50 Golden Eagles are expected to begin deliveries by April 2016 boosting the Iraqi Air Force's defense capabilities. On 5 November 2015, the first two Czech Aero L-159 light combat aircraft were delivered to Iraq. The first group of Iraqi pilots completed training in the Czech company Aero Vodochody on 9 February 2016. Iraq will gain a total of 15 Aero L-159s and Aero Vodochody will make 12 aircraft operable for the Iraqi Air Force. Two other planes {{will be used for}} the reconstruction of two aircraft into two-seaters, one will be used for spare parts. For nearly three years, United Kingdom has blocked the sale of L-159s because they contain British radar warning receiver. However, Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to overturn the ban in February 2016 and the sale to Iraq <b>is</b> <b>proceeding.</b>|$|E

25|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{efforts in the}} {{education}} sector, other sectors (for example, certain aspects of housing and municipal services) in Egypt are planning to decentralize decision-making and spending, now nationwide (without a pilot stage in limited governorates), in a phased approach. Education plans {{to be one of}} the lead sectors in this process. In addition to administrative and financial decentralization, there is an increasing emphasis on involving elected local popular councils (which exist at governorate and district level) in the horizontal oversight of expenditure and planning across the decentralizing sectors, and as they come on stream in the decentralization process. Within the education sector, as of late 2009 plans are being made to decentralize certain lines of funding and planning for capital equipment and infrastructure, in all governorates, all the way to school level in the case of smaller units of capital equipment, or levels higher than the school for items such as new infrastructure. The education sector does expect to continue to use the original 3 pilot governorates as a special observatory to assess and understand how well the process <b>is</b> <b>proceeding.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 February 1525, Imperial {{engineers}} opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello, allowing Lannoy's forces to enter the park. At the same time, Leyva sortied from Pavia with {{what remained of the}} garrison. [...] In the ensuing four-hour battle, the French heavy cavalry, which had proven so effective against the Swiss at Marignano ten years prior, masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d'Avalos's massed Spanish arquebusiers. [...] Meanwhile, a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry. [...] The French suffered massive casualties, losing the majority of their army. Bonnivet, Jacques de la Palice, La Tr칠moille, and Richard de la Pole were killed, while Anne de Montmorency, Robert de la Marck, and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles. [...] The night following the battle, Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris, in which he related what had befallen him: [...] "To inform you of how the rest of my ill-fortune <b>is</b> <b>proceeding,</b> all is lost to me save honour and life, which is safe." [...] Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples. [...] The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel Sforzesco in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alen칞on, reaching Lyon by March 1525.|$|E
