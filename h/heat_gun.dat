25|$|On March 15, 2015, a fire engulfed the convent's tallest bell tower, which pinnacles at {{height of}} 72 meters. The monastery had been {{undergoing}} major repair work and {{was covered in}} scaffolding. It took firefighters almost three hours {{to put out the}} fire. The blaze reportedly affected an area of three hundred square metres, but it was restricted to the scaffolding and didn't do any damage to the historical building itself. The speculated cause of the fire was a short circuit caused by <b>heat</b> <b>guns</b> used for drying the facade. The press service for the Moscow cultural heritage department has blamed the fire on the firm doing the restoration work. However, Russian Deputy Culture Minister Grigory Pirumov said that <b>heat</b> <b>guns</b> were not in use on the territory of the convent and the bell tower had been disconnected from the mains power supply.|$|R

50|$|Some core {{materials}} can be bent {{into a number}} of shapes to give variety and uniqueness to a weapon. A common way to bend a PVC core is with a blow torch or kitchen stove; however, <b>heat</b> <b>guns</b> or boiling water are preferred by some as these methods deliver even heat, to prevent burning or weakening of the core. Rattan is generally soaked in water and then moulded to fit a shape.|$|R
5000|$|A local resident, Mark Alan Wilson, {{was in his}} {{downtown}} loft when {{he heard}} the shooting begin. He looked out his window and saw Arroyo at the courthouse steps engaged in a shootout with law enforcement. Wilson, who held a Texas concealed handgun permit, immediately armed himself with his Colt [...]45 caliber pistol, and left his residence to intervene in the gun battle. Because Arroyo was already engaged in a <b>heated</b> <b>gun</b> battle with sheriff's deputies and Tyler police officers, he did not see Wilson approach from behind.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 28, 1998 a mass of black smoke expanded over the Barrington village center darkening an otherwise bright, blue Autumn sky.

50|$|The lead can {{be removed}} with {{techniques}} such as wire brushing or wet hand scraping with liquid paint removers.

50|$|Working in a lead-safe manner means {{avoiding}} dry sanding, dry scraping, removing paint by torching/burning, {{the use of}} <b>heat</b> <b>guns</b> over 1100°F, machine-sanding or grinding without HEPA filtered {{dust collection}} or HEPA-filtered vacuum. These methods are now prohibited by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) {{because they have been}} proved to create significant levels of lead dust during remodeling, renovation and painting. They must be avoided, especially in properties where children under age six reside. Adult workers using unsafe work practices or improper protective gear may also become lead-poisoned.|$|R
50|$|Metal {{tools and}} special brushes {{can be used}} to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools {{can be used to}} {{manipulate}} the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Today, tools such as <b>heat</b> lamps, <b>heat</b> <b>guns,</b> and other methods of applying heat allow artists to extend the amount of time they have to work with the material. Because wax is used as the pigment binder, encaustics can be sculpted as well as painted. Other materials can be encased or collaged into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to stick them to the surface.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat shrink tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two <b>heat</b> <b>guns.</b> The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the <b>heat</b> <b>guns</b> onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R
