5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Transportation</b> completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
