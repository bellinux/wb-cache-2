40|$|Background: The {{harvest of}} {{autologous}} skin graft {{is considered to}} be a fundamental skill of the plastic surgeon. The objective of this article is to provide an interesting account of the development of skin grafting instruments as we use them today in various plastic surgical procedures. Materials and Methods: The authors present the chronological evolution and modifications of the skin <b>grafting</b> <b>knife,</b> including those contributions not often cited in the literature, using articles sourced from MEDLINE, ancient manuscripts, original quotes, techniques and illustrations. Results: This article traces the evolution of instrumentation for harvest of skin grafts from free hand techniques to precise modern automated methods. Conclusions: Although skin grafting is one of the basic techniques used in reconstructive surgery yet harvest of a uniform graft of desired thickness poses a challenge. This article is dedicated to innovators who have devoted their lives and work to the advancement of the field of plastic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Known {{under the}} {{scientific}} denomination Wisteria sinensis wisteria is an everlasting liana, with size of 10 - 15 m, {{with a very}} vigorous growing and a special decorative aspect. Multiplication of the wisteria is done on generative way (by seeding) or vegetative (by cutting propagation, grafting and marcottage). Multiplication by seeding gives weaker results and the flourishing is long delayed (after 7 years) and do not preserve the characters of mother plant (color, fragrance, size of the inflorescence, richness of flours, etc) so it is preferred the vegetative multiplication. Researches done had as purpose the diversification of intervention methods regarding the marcottage of wisteria with practical applicability. The experiences were performed in the nursery Mihai Viteazu, within Turda Forest Organization, in the period 2005 - 2006. As materials were used pots in plastic materials of different sizes, bamboo sticks, soil in different compositions, stimulants for roots, <b>grafting</b> <b>knife.</b> It was pursued to obtain some wisteria seeding plants by circular marcottage in pots, using as basis different compositions of organic substrate, as it follows: Alternative 1. â€“ garden soil taken directly {{from the field of}} the nursery; Alternative 2. - 50 % soil from the field of the nursery + 50 % substrate in which the cutting propagation was done; Alternative 3. - 50 % soil from the fiel...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of snake venom derived from fibrin glue on the {{viability}} of split-thickness skin graft. Nine crossbreed dogs were used. Full-thickness skin segments measuring 4 x 4 cm were bilaterally excised from the proximal radial area on each dog. A split-thickness skin graft was harvested from left lateral thoracic area using a freehand <b>graft</b> <b>knife,</b> and was secured to the left recipient bed using several simple interrupted sutures of 3 - 0 nylon (sutured graft). A split-thickness skin graft was harvested from the right lateral thoracic area using a <b>graft</b> <b>knife.</b> Fibrin glue derived from snake venom was applied to the recipient bed, and 8 equidistant simple interrupted sutures of 3 - 0 nylon were used to secure the skin graft (glued graft). Viable and nonviable areas were traced on a transparent sheet and measured using a Nikon Photomicroscope connected to a KS- 300 image analysis system. The skin graft and recipient bed were collected from three dogs at day 7, 15, and 30 postoperative. The glued grafts had statistically higher graft viability than sutured grafts. Histological examination showed that the tissue repair process in the glued grafts was more accentuated than sutured grafts. It was possible to conclude that fibrin glue derived fro...|$|R

5000|$|Cutting Tools: It is good {{procedure}} {{to keep the}} cutting tool sharp to minimize tissue damage and clean from dirt and other substances to avoid the spread of disease. A good <b>knife</b> for general <b>grafting</b> should have a blade and handle length of about 3 inches and 4 inches respectively. Specialized <b>knives</b> for <b>grafting</b> include bud-grafting <b>knives,</b> surgical knives, and pruning knives. Cleavers, chisels, and saws are utilized when the stock is too large to be cut otherwise.|$|R
40|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{that causes}} wilting and cankers, leading to severe economic losses in commercial tomato production worldwide. The disease {{is transmitted from}} infected seeds to seedlings and mechanically from plant to plant during seedling production, grafting, pruning, and harvesting. Because {{of the lack of}} tools for genetic manipulation, very little is known regarding the mechanisms of seed and seedling infection and movement of C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis in grafted plants, two focal points for application of bacterial canker control measures in tomato. To facilitate studies on the C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis movement in tomato seed and grafted plants, we isolated a bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis strain using the modified Tn 1409 containing a promoterless lux reporter. A total of 19 bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis mutants were obtained. All mutants tested induced a hypersensitive response in Mirabilis jalapa and caused wilting of tomato plants. Real-time colonization studies of germinating seeds using a virulent, stable, constitutively bioluminescent strain, BL-Cmm 17, showed that C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis aggregated on hypocotyls and cotyledons at an early stage of germination. In grafted seedlings in which either the rootstock or scion was exposed to BL-Cmm 17 via a contaminated <b>grafting</b> <b>knife,</b> bacteria were translocated in both directions from the graft union at higher inoculum doses. These results emphasize the use of bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis to help better elucidate the C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis-tomato plant interactions. Further, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this tool by successful transformation of C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with Tn 1409 ::lux. Thus, our approach would be highly useful to understand the pathogenesis of diseases caused by other subspecies of the agriculturally important C. michiganensis...|$|E
