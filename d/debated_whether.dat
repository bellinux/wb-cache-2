5|$|The Synod of Whitby, which <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> the Northumbrian church {{should follow}} the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, {{was held in}} 664. Deusdedit {{does not appear to}} have been present, perhaps because of an {{outbreak}} of the plague prevalent in England at the time.|$|E
5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native Americans {{and the first}} European settlers in America. Scholars have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> the piece is progressive in its depiction of the natives and have commented that the work reflects an emerging American dramatic and musical sensibility.

5|$|When {{discussing}} chess {{history from}} the 1850s onwards, commentators have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> Steinitz could be effectively considered the champion from an earlier time, perhaps as early as 1866. Steinitz lost his title to Emanuel Lasker in 1894, and lost a rematch in 1896–97.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E

5|$|Despairing of any siege {{operation}} {{against the}} Temple's massive walls, Titus had the gates burnt down. At the ensuing council of war, {{when it was}} <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> to destroy the entire Temple, Alexander voted with the majority who favored preservation. In the event, this made no difference; as the fighting raged on the following day, a Roman soldier hurled a burning brand into a chamber of the Temple itself. The Temple was consumed by the flames.|$|E
5|$|On the book's publication, Waugh's friends praised it, but {{its general}} {{critical}} reception was muted. Most reviewers admired the self-portrait of Waugh {{with which the}} novel opens, but expressed divided views about the rest, in particular the ending. Commentators have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> the novel provides a real-life depiction of Waugh, or if it represents the exaggerated persona that he cultivated {{as a means of}} preserving his privacy. The book has been dramatised for radio and as a stage play.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> El Greco's style had Byzantine origins. Certain art historians had asserted that El Greco's roots were firmly in the Byzantine tradition, and that his most individual characteristics derive directly from the art of his ancestors, while others had argued that Byzantine art could not be related to El Greco's later work.|$|E
5|$|Tali was {{initially}} the only quarian in the series. In the sequels, more extreme variations of her design were discarded {{in favor of}} revisions on her previous look. The Mass Effect 3 development team considered her removal from the squad, but ultimately chose to include her due to staff interest. The team also <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> to reveal her masked face.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{narrative}} {{echoes the}} text of the Nunc dimittis, a liturgical prayer for Compline derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes, Dante Alighieri and St. John of the Cross. Several critics have <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of anti-Semitism on Eliot's part.|$|E

5|$|Three {{subspecies}} {{were identified}} by Goldman in 1935, M.p. columbiana, M.p. pacifica, and M.p. pennanti. Later research has <b>debated</b> <b>whether</b> these subspecies could be positively identified. In 1959, E.M. Hagmeier concluded that the subspecies are not separable based on either fur or skull characteristics. Although some debate still exists, in general it is recognized that the fisher is a monotypic species with no extant subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long <b>debated</b> <b>whether,</b> given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt, was adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also <b>debated</b> <b>whether,</b> as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E
