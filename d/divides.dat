5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then <b>divides</b> its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth <b>divides</b> and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means one has the basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} notion of weak <b>dividing</b> {{introduced}} by S. Shelah. In particular we prove that T is stable iff weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric. In order to study simple theories Shelah originally defined weak <b>dividing</b> in [6]. This notion is overshadowed by that of <b>dividing,</b> as the first author proved that <b>dividing</b> is the right well-behaved notion for simple theories [2],[3],[5],and [4]. However Dolich’s paper[1] reminded us that weak <b>dividing</b> is still an interesting notion. There he noted that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric and transitive in stable theories, and that simplicity {{is characterized by the}} property that <b>dividing</b> implies weak <b>dividing.</b> Here we continue the investigation of {{the notion of}} weak <b>dividing.</b> Intriguingly, what weak <b>dividing</b> is to stability is analogous with what <b>dividing</b> is to simplicity. For example, we show that weak <b>dividing</b> is symmetric only in stable theories (2. 5). Stability is also equivalent to left local character of weak <b>dividing.</b> However for the transitivity of weak <b>dividing,</b> a similar analogy does not exist. Namely, in a non-stable simple theory (e. g. the theory of the random graph), weak <b>dividing</b> can be transitive (2. 7). As usual, we work in a saturated model of an arbitrary complete theory T.

40|$|The {{issue of}} digital <b>divide</b> has {{attracted}} many researchers {{for over a}} decade, yet the understanding of digital <b>divide</b> is not comprehensive. This research examines three commonly recognised orders of the digital <b>divide,</b> which are: economic <b>divide,</b> the inequality of access to ICT associated with economic conditions; access <b>divide,</b> the disparity of access to ICT; and capability <b>divide,</b> the inequality of ability in using ICT, while conceptualising a fourth <b>divide,</b> innovativeness <b>divide,</b> which {{is defined as the}} disparity of individual’s willingness to try out any new information technology. The paper presents a tentative model based on extensive literature review which was explored using qualitative method. The findings generate new insights into the relationships among those four orders of digital <b>divide</b> which contribute to the theoretical framework to understand the digital <b>divide</b> more comprehensively and provide evidence on the impact of digital <b>divide</b> on e-government use.
