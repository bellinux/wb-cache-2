5000|$|The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was a {{molten salt}} reactor {{run by the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was nuclear {{graphite}} moderated and the coolant salt used was FLiBe, which also carried the uranium-233 fluoride fuel dissolved in it. The MSRE had a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity: as the FLiBe temperature increased, it expanded, along with the uranium ions it carried; this decreased density resulted in a reduction of fissile material in the core, which decreased the rate of fission. With less heat input, the net result was that the reactor would cool. Extending {{from the bottom of}} the reactor core was a pipe that lead to passively cooled drain tanks. The pipe had a [...] "freeze valve" [...] along its length, in which the molten salt was actively cooled to a solid plug by a fan blowing air over the pipe. If the reactor vessel developed excessive heat or lost electric power to the air cooling, the plug would melt; the FLiBe would be pulled out of the reactor core by gravity into <b>dump</b> <b>tanks,</b> and criticality would cease as the salt lost contact with the graphite moderator.|$|R
50|$|After {{considering}} a water tank in Malta, Lourié chose the water tank {{he had used}} for the 1964 film Flight from Ashiya at Cinecittà in Rome to film special effects sequences depicting the Batavia Queen at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three Super Panavision 70 cameras running at three times normal speed to make {{the movements of the}} miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Lourié tried to disguise the miniature Batavia Queens lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the Batavia Queen rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Lourié's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) <b>dump</b> <b>tanks</b> with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters), spraying water into the tank with powerful fire hoses, and employing a wind machine to disturb the water's surface.|$|R
50|$|A Ludwieg tube is a {{wind tunnel}} that {{produces}} supersonic flow {{for short periods}} of time. A large evacuated <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> is separated from the downstream end of a convergent-divergent nozzle by a diaphragm or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the <b>dump</b> <b>tank)</b> and an expansion wave propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the convergent-divergent nozzle to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from {{the far end of}} the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes. For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.|$|E

40|$|The {{wastewater}} management objective for a tomato processor is to implement sound and performance guaranteed systems which minimize wastewater related costs. Using performance parameter values {{found in this}} project, it was demonstrated that installation and operation of an in-plant water recycle system with off-line mud removal would result in approximately 50 % savings in the total annual wastewater related costs. For the 35 ton/hr plant evaluated, annual savings would amount to approximately $ 47, 000. The ' 75 season performance parameter values were obtained from investigation of four modes of operation; conventional cleaning; conventional cleaning with water recycle; disc cleaner with water recycle; and, disc cleaner with recycle and chemical coagulation-f loccul ation. Water consumption and total solids balances were made on each mode. Not surprisingly the daily average tonnage of tomatoes processed increased substantially with disc cleaning and water recycle {{as compared to the}} conventional system. An increase of 26 % in the tonnage of tomatoes processed was realized with the disc cleaner with water recycle and chemical flocculation. These increases in the daily tonnage of tomatoes processed may be primarily due to the virtual elimination of solids accumulation in the <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> with consequent impaired product flow. No incident of temporary shutdown of shift operation for <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> clean-up was encountered during the modes of operation with water recycle. With respect to the water consumption, the following findings were established in this study: 1.

Two tests are analysed. The LIFUS 5 /Mod 2 facility implemented a test section composed by 188 tubes, vertically disposed with triangular pitch, in a shell closed by top and bottom flanges and having a perforated cylindrical wall. The central tube injected water at about 180 bar and 270 °C, at middle height of the tube bundle, in the reaction tank partially filled by Lead-Bismuth Eutectic alloy (LBE) at 400 °C with an argon cover gas at about 2 bar. It was connected to a 2 m 3 <b>dump</b> <b>tank,</b> due to the high injection pressure. In the reaction tank fast instrumentation was set: 6 fast Pressure Transducers (PTs) acquiring data at 10 kHz for precisely characterize the first injection peaks; 70 low constant time Thermocouples (TCs) to understand the vapour evolution path; and 13 strain gages (SGGs) to measure the strain of the bundle and main vessel. The first test analysed showed a first pressure peak of about 25 bar, due to pressure wave propagation at the cap rupture instant. It did not appear in the second test as consequence of a leakage from the cap before the complete rupture. The following pressurization caused by the entering of water into the reaction vessel was of an analogues magnitude for both the tests (about 30 bar). The water/LBE interaction lower temperature was reached on the inner ranks of tubes, about 160 °C. The outer rank was cooled down to 340 °C. The strain gage measurements showed a decreasing deformation on the tubes toward the outer positions. No ruptures were observed on tubes surrounding the injector.

After reactor inertization, the bottom valve of the <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> was opened to collect spent powder and remove it. Unexpectedly, the powder on the floor started evaporating hydrocarbons. A propane cloud drifted very fast through the plant and ignited at the pump station area: even if the flash fire was extinguished immediately, there were several people injured and one fatality.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Potential {{sources of}} {{inoculum}} of Phialophora malorum were investigated. P. malorum {{was found to}} be a soil-borne fungus whose role as a postharvest pathogen of pear is dependent upon passive dispersal with infested soil. P. malorum survived in soil under a wide range of conditions, with greatest survival in cool, moderately dry soil of nearneutral pH. P. malorum was not a primary colonizer of fallen fruit on orchard soil, but propagule numbers increased subsequent to fruit decay by other microorganisms. Cankers were induced when P. malorum was inoculated into injured bark of pear trees. However, cankers were nonperrenating, and P. malorum was not recovered from cankered tissue for more than one season. The fungus also survived saprophytically on the bark of pear trees, but dispersal of inoculum from infested bark to fruit or other areas of bark on the same trees was not observed. Inoculation of fruit and redistribution of inoculum from infested to previously uninfested fruit in packinghouse immersion <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> solutions was demonstrated. Infection took place at fruit wounds. Spore penetration into wounds was influenced by wound diameter and hydrostatic pressure during immersion dumping. Infection via intact lenticels could not be induced. Results suggest that sanitation to avoid contamination of packinghouse immersion tanks with orchard soil may reduce disease incidence. As a weak competitor in colonizing pear tissue, P. malorum appears vulnerable to control through enhancement of fruit resistance or biological control...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{mechanism}} by which disturbances can cause tripping between steady-flow regular and Mach reflection in the dual-solution domain is presented. Computational {{results indicate that the}} disturbance shock created {{as a result of the}} impact of dense particles on one of the shock-generating wedges can cause transition from regular to Mach reflection. The disturbance shock may also be generated by direct energy deposition on the wedge. Estimates of the lower bound of the required energy for transition to occur are presented and compared to values obtained computationally. Experiments were performed at Mach 4. 0 in a Ludwieg tube that has a test duration of 100 ms. Proper starting of the flow necessitated operation with an upstream diaphragm and modifications in the <b>dump</b> <b>tank.</b> The reflection state was changed by rapid rotation of one of the shock-generating wedges. The flow in the facility is sufficiently quiet to permit entering the dual-solution domain to approximately its midpoint before spontaneous transition to the Mach reflection occurs. The short test time prompted a {{study of the}} effect of wedge rotation speed on the transition from regular to Mach reflection. Transition due to deposition of energy on one of the wedges was also examined by using a pulsed laser focused on one of the two wedges.

40|$|Tomato packers often {{struggle}} {{to find ways to}} reuse the large volumes of wastewater generated during the tomato cleaning and sanitizing processes due to high transportation costs for off-site disposal and strict surface water discharge regulations in Florida. Information about the composition of tomato packinghouse wastewater and the likely sources of major wastewater constituents might provide insights to develop environmentally sustainable practices for wastewater reuse. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the chemical composition of wastewater generated in tomato packinghouses. The wastewater samples were collected for 6 to 8 hours from dump tanks of two representative packinghouses at 30 minute intervals after start-up of packing operations during May-June 2009. Results showed that wastewater had high electrical conductivity (1. 3 - 2. 8 dS·m– 1 ) and chloride (255 - 1125 mg·L– 1 ) due to the use of chlorine as a sanitizer in the packinghouses. Concentrations of total phosphorus (P, 2. 8 - 5. 7 mg·L– 1 ) and copper (Cu, 1. 9 - 2. 2 mg·L– 1 ) in wastewater were elevated due to tomato cleaning and sanitizing. To reduce P and Cu concentrations, treatment or blending of wastewater may be needed before discharging wastewater to surface waters. Concentrations of P, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, and manganese were much higher in packinghouse 1 as compared to packinghouse 2 wastewater, probably due to the greater contact time of tomatoes with the <b>dump</b> <b>tank</b> water. Whereas concentrations of Cu were similar in both packinghouses wastewater.

40|$|Expansion {{tubes are}} {{important}} facilities {{for the study}} of high enthalpy hypersonic flows which avoid the non-equilibrium chemical and thermal effects associated with the flow stagnation intrinsic to reflected shock tunnels. X 3 {{is one of the largest}} freepiston super-orbital expansion tube in the world with an overall length of approximately 69 m and is capable of generating reentry speed flows equivalent to those experienced during a hyperbolic re-entry trajectory. It was originally built with a twostage free-piston driver to achieve the high compression ratio of a large diameter compression tube without the high construction costs of designing the large diameter tube to be strong enough to resist peak driver pressure loads. However, this arrangement proved difficult in operation. This paper describes the upgrades to X 3, in respect to its physical layout. The facility has been recommissioned to incorporate a single-piston driver, a steady expansion nozzle and a new test section. Major changes have been made to the free-piston driver with a re-designed piston and launcher and a new end cap tube which is 200 mm thick to contain driver pressures up to 80 MPa. The re-designed piston introduces an area change at the primary diaphragm, ensuring that the maximum increase in total pressure and temperature can be gained as the driver gas undergoes unsteady expansion from sonic to supersonic conditions. The compression process steadily increases up to Mach 1 at the throat then gains of up to an order of magnitude in total temperature and pressure can be realised as the unsteady expansion process takes over. The area change will also increase test times; with a throat at the primary diaphragm, the piston mechanics can be more readily tuned to minimise reflection of waves off the piston which would otherwise reduce the test time. A new Mach 10 steady expansion nozzle has been developed which has increased the core flow and the test time for appropriate conditions.
