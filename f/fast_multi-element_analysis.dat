40|$|The growing {{urban and}} tourist {{activity}} in the Mexican Caribbean coasts has resulted in an increase of chemical substances, metals in particular, discharged to the coastal waters. In order to reach an adequate management and conservation of these marine ecosystems {{it is necessary to}} perform an inventory of the actual conditions that reflect the vulnerability and the level of damage. Sea-grasses are considered good biological indicators of heavy metal contamination in marine systems. The goal of this preliminary work is to evaluate the concentrations of trace metals such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, and Pb in Thalassia testudinum, a very common sea-grass in the Mexican Caribbean Sea. Samples were collected from several locations in the coasts of the Yucatán Peninsula: Holbox, Blanquizal and Punta Allen, areas virtually uninfluenced by anthropogenic activities. Trace elements in different part plants were determined by particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE). This is a very suitable technique since it offers a <b>fast,</b> accurate and <b>multi-element</b> <b>analysis.</b> Also, the analysis by PIXE can be performed directly on powdered leaves without a laborious sample preparation. The trace metal concentration determined in sea-grasses growing in Caribbean generally fall in the range of the lowest valuables reported for sea grasses from the Gulf of Mexico.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of cattle {{may be influenced}} by several factors, but mineral imbalances are crucial in terms of direct effects on reproduction. Several studies have shown that elements such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are essential for reproduction and can prevent oxidative stress. However, toxic elements such as lead, nickel, and arsenic can have adverse effects on reproduction. In this paper, we applied a simple and <b>fast</b> method of <b>multi-element</b> <b>analysis</b> to bovine semen samples from Zebu and European classes used in reproduction programs and artificial insemination. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) using aqueous medium calibration and the samples were diluted in a proportion of 1 : 50 in a solution containing 0. 01 % (vol/vol) Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % (vol/vol) nitric acid. Rhodium, iridium, and yttrium were used as the internal standards for ICP-MS analysis. To develop a reliable method of tracing the class of bovine semen, we used data mining techniques that make it possible to classify unknown samples after checking the differentiation of known-class samples. Based on the determination of 15 elements in 41 samples of bovine semen, 3 machine-learning tools for classification were applied to determine cattle class. Our results demonstrate the potential of support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) chemometric tools to identify cattle class. Moreover, the selection tools made it possible {{to reduce the number of}} chemical elements needed from 15 to just 8.

40|$|Several {{techniques}} of <b>multi-element</b> <b>analysis</b> using reac-tors and accelerators have been developed. There are two {{techniques of}} neutron activation analysis: instrumental neu-tron activation analysis (INAA) and prompt gamma-ray analysis (PGA). 1 - 5 The conventional INAA requires the neu-tron-induced production of radionuclides emitting gamma-rays with adequate half-lives. INAA {{could not be}} used for radionuclides with typical half-lives of 10 − 14 - to 10 − 12 s. This limitation can be overcome by applying the technique of PGA. For a number of elements that do not produce good delayed products, the analytical sensitivity of PGA has been estimated to be better than that of INAA. 1 For the assay of the samples by PGA and INAA, the external standard sam-ples need be prepared by matching their matrices and con-sidering geometrical arrangement in order to reduce problems caused by neutron absorption and scattering 6, 7 and gamma-ray absorption. Nakahara and his coworkers 8 have recently shown that those problems could be overcome using an internal mono-standard method. <b>Multi-element</b> <b>analysis</b> can be also performed by proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) using accelerator, which is based on the detection of charac-teristic x-ray.
