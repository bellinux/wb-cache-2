5000|$|The parallel-plate flow chamber is {{a widely}} used piece of {{equipment}} for studying cellular mechanics on the benchtop. Many researchers used parallel-plate flow chambers to investigate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> between leukocytes (white blood cells) and endothelial cells (blood vessel lining cells) under definite shear stress. In particular, some studies {{have been carried out}} to study leukocyte receptor-ligand interactions. Interactions between cell receptors (selectins and/or integrins) and their ligands mediate rolling and are believed {{to play an important role}} in leukocyte adhesion. Moreover, many researchers used parallel-plate flow chambers to provide shear stress and to mimic the environment of cancer cell growth outside of the body. It is a versatile tool in understanding the mechanisms of proliferation, adhesion, and metastasis of cancer cells. Parallel plate flow chambers are widely used also for drug testing in the cellular chemotaxis assay [...] and for novel targeted drug delivery systems based on leukocyte-endothelium adhesion processes.|$|E
40|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> {{behavior}} of micrometer-scale silica particles is investigated numerically for a low Reynolds number shear flow over a planar collecting wall with randomly distributed electrostatic heterogeneity at the 10 -nanometer scale. The hydrodynamic forces and torques on a particle are coupled to spatially varying colloidal {{interactions between the}} particle and wall. Contact and frictional forces {{are included in the}} force and torque balances to capture particle skipping, rolling, and arrest. These <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> signatures are consistent with experimental results and are reminiscent of motion signatures observed in cell adhesion under flowing conditions, although for the synthetic system the particle–wall interactions are controlled by colloidal forces rather than physical bonds between cells and a functionalized surface. As the fraction of the surface (Θ) covered by the cationic patches is increased from zero, particle behavior sequentially transitions from no contact with the surface to skipping, rolling, and arrest, with the threshold patch density for adhesion (Θcrit) always greater than zero and in quantitative agreement with experimental results. The ionic strength of the flowing solution determines the extent of the electrostatic interactions and can be used to tune selectively the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> behavior by modulating two competing effects. The extent of electrostatic interactions in the plane of the wall, or electrostatic zone of influence, governs the importance of spatial fluctuations in the cationic patch density and thus determines if flowing particles contact the wall. The distance these interactions extend into solution normal to the wall determines the strength of the particle–wall attraction, which governs the transition from skipping and rolling to arrest. The influence of Θ, particle size, Debye length, and shear rate is quantified through the construction of adhesion regime diagrams, which delineate the regions in parameter space that give rise to different <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> signatures and illustrate selective adhesion based on particle size or curvature. The results of this study are suggestive of novel ways to control particle–wall interactions using randomly distributed surface heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the combination of}} supported membranes and so-called flat microfluidics, which enables one to manipulate liquids on flat chip surfaces via ``inverse piezoelectric effect''. Here, an alternating external electric field applied to the inter-digital transducers excites a surface acoustic wave on a piezoelectric substrate. Employing lithographic patterning of self-assembled monolayers of alkoxysilanes, we successfully confine a free-standing, hemi-cylindrical channel with the volume of merely 7 µL. The experimentally determined maximum flow velocity scales linearly with the acoustic power, suggesting that our current setup can drive liquids {{at the speed of}} up to 7 cm/s (corresponding to a shear rate of 280 s(- 1)) without applying high pressures using a fluidic pump. After the establishment of the functionalization of fluidic chip surfaces with supported membranes, we deposited asymmetric supported membranes displaying well-defined mannose domains and monitored the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> of E.

40|$|Cell {{motility}} necessitates {{the rapid}} formation and disassembly of cell adhesions. We have studied adhesions {{in a highly}} motile melanoma cell line using various biochemical approaches and microscopic techniques to image close adhesions. We report that WM- 1617 melanoma cells contain at least two types of close adhesion: classic focal adhesions and more extensive, irregularly shaped adhesions that tend to occur along lamellipodial edges. In contrast to focal adhesions, these latter <b>adhesions</b> are highly <b>dynamic</b> and can be disassembled rapidly via protein kinase C (PKC) activation (e. g. by eicosanoid) and MARCKS phosphorylation. MARCKS overexpression, however, greatly increases the area of close adhesions and renders them largely refractory to PKC stimulation. This indicates that nonphosphorylated MARCKS is an adhesion stabilizer. Unlike focal <b>adhesions,</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesions</b> contain α 3 integrin and MARCKS, {{but they do not}} contain the focal adhesion marker vinculin. Overall, these results begin to define the molecular and functional properties of <b>dynamic</b> close <b>adhesions</b> involved in cell motility...|$|R

Integrin-mediated clutch formation between extracellular ICAM- 1 and the intracellular actin cytoskeleton {{is important for}} {{cell adhesion}}. We applied single-molecule tracking analysis to LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 in living cells to examine the ligand-binding kinetics and mobility of the molecular clutch under chemokine-induced physiological adhesion and Mn 2 +-induced tight adhesion.

40|$|Selective <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> of {{particles}} and objects from flow over heterogeneous surfaces is observed in natural systems {{as well as}} current technologies. Accurate modeling and prediction of the dynamics {{of particles}} interacting with such surfaces will facilitate their use in applications for sensing, separating, and sorting colloidal-scale objects. The current study is aimed at addressing the need for a theoretical model which could provide a comprehensive understanding of the physics of such systems at the length scale of the heterogeneities. The model could be used to investigate and interpret effects of systems parameters on particle dynamics and provide design guidelines for obtaining desired selectivity on artificially patterned surfaces. ^ In this study, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> behavior of micrometer-scale particles is investigated numerically for a low Reynolds number shear flow over a flat collecting surface with randomly distributed electrostatic heterogeneity (2 ̆ 2 patches 2 ̆ 2) at the 10 -nanometer scale. These patches are realized in experiments as cationic polymers deposited from flowing solution and lie flat on the surface. A novel technique based on surface discretization is introduced to facilitate computation of the colloidal interactions between a spherical particle and the heterogeneous surface based on expressions for parallel plates. The colloidal interactions are combined with the hydrodynamic forces and torques on a spherical particle yield a computational model for particle motion in a solution flowing over a heterogeneous collector. Spatial fluctuations in the local surface density of the deposited patches, which are due to the random distribution of the charge heterogeneities, are shown responsible for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> signatures observed experimentally, including particle capture on a net-repulsive surface and selectivity based on particle size or curvature. Particle deposition rates on these nanotextured surfaces are obtained by simulating particle trajectories over a large number of surfaces and analyzing the data using a probabilistic approach. The model is extended to account for particle motion after surface contact by including contact or frictional forces in the force and torque balances and yields a predictive and interpretative simulation tool for studying particle skipping, rolling, and arrest on the heterogeneously charged surface. The influence of the patch density on the surface, particle size, Debye length, and shear rate is quantified through the construction of adhesion regime diagrams, which delineate the regions in parameter space that give rise to different <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> signatures and suggest ways to control particle-surface interactions. The simulation data is analyzed to determine the threshold density of patches and the binding energy per patch at the adhesion sites. ^ The predicted adhesion signatures, adhesion thresholds, particle deposition rates, and selectivity are in strong agreement with experimental results and are reminiscent of motion signatures observed in cell adhesion under flowing conditions, although for the synthetic system long range, non-specific colloidal interactions take the place of specific physical bonds between the cells and functionalized surface. ...|$|E

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} into cell biology by Curtis in 1964, interference reflection microscopy (IRM) {{has been used}} by an increasing number of researchers to study cell-substrate interactions in living cells in culture. With the use of antiflex objectives, high-contrast IRM images can now be readily obtained. From the different theories on image formation in IRM that have been put forward, {{it can be seen that}} a zero-order interference pattern is generated at high illuminating numerical aperture. This yields information on the closeness of contact between cell and substrate, with only minor perturbation by reflections from the dorsal cell surface. Therefore, the proper use of illuminating apertures is crucial. Nevertheless, IRM images have to be interpreted with caution, especially under thin cytoplasmic sheets. Quantitative IRM is possible only with a mathematical model for finite illuminating aperture interferometry and with an independent measurement of cell thickness for values up to 1 fim. IRM has been applied qualitatively to a large number of cell types, and it seems that there are two universal types of adhesion. Focal contacts are small regions of closest cell-substrate apposition, possibly of immediate contact, that are associated with the distal end of actin filament bundles. They are firm attachment structures that hold the cell in place and in its spread shape. Close contacts are broad areas of reduced cell-to-substrate distance. They are weaker but highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesions</b> that sustain rapid movements of cells or cell parts over the substrate. Although a number of independent observations suggest that adhesion patterns of malignantly transformed cells differ from those of their normal counterparts, there is no simple correlation between malignancy in vivo and altered contact formation in vitro. The adhesion pattern seems to be determined by the locomotory state of the cells rather than by their tissue of origin. Finally, IRM can also be used to enhance contrast in images of fixed preparations...|$|R

40|$|We present here a novel form of <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> {{in which}} both the {{integrin}} receptor and the ligand supporting <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> have been identified. Laminar flow assays showed that laminin supported attachment of alpha 6 beta 4 -positive cells {{in the presence of}} fluid shear stress (tau 3 ̆c or = 2 dyn/cm 2), indicating that these cells adhered to laminin within a fraction of a second. Further increases in flow rate (3. 5 dyn/cm 2 3 ̆c or = tau 3 ̆c or = 100 dyn/cm 2) initiated rolling of attached cells in the direction of flow, suggesting that rapidly formed adhesion is reversible and repeatable. Laminin fragment E 8, which interacts with alpha 6 integrins, supported dynamic attachment and rolling but extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin did not. In cell lines that express alpha 6 beta 4 but not alpha 6 beta 1 an anti-alpha 6 monoclonal antibody inhibited attachment to laminin in the presence of flow and following 5 minutes of static incubation. Infusion of this antibody onto cells adherent to laminin-coated slides led to rapid detachment of cells from the substratum. An anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody diminished adhesion strength following static incubation but did not inhibit rapid attachment and flow-initiated rolling.

During the expansion of a podosome ring, substrate displacement is oriented outward, suggesting that podosomal structures push the substrate away. To further elucidate the function of forces generated by podosomes, we analyze osteoclast migration. Determining the centers of mass of the whole cell (G) and of actin (P), we demonstrate that osteoclasts migrate by "jumps" and that the trajectories of G and P are strongly correlated.

Expression of mutation constructs or small interfering RNA-/short hairpin RNA-based depletion of KIF 1 C resulted in decreased podosome dynamics and ultimately in podosome deficiency. Importantly, protein interaction studies showed that KIF 1 C binds to nonmuscle myosin IIA via its PTPD-binding domain, thus providing an interface between the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons, which may facilitate the subcellular targeting of podosomes by microtubules.

Whether PVB 19 infects endothelial cells and causes a modification of endothelial function and inflammation and, thus, disturbance of microcirculation has not been elucidated and could not be visualized so far. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To examine the PVB 19 -induced endothelial modification, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP) color reporter gene in the non-structural segment 1 (NS 1) of PVB 19. NS 1 -GFP-PVB 19 or GFP plasmid as control were transfected in an endothelial-like cell line (ECV 304). The endothelial surface expression of intercellular-adhesion molecule- 1 (CD 54 /ICAM- 1) and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN/CD 147) were evaluated by flow cytometry after NS- 1 -GFP or control-GFP transfection. To evaluate platelet adhesion on NS- 1 transfected ECs, we performed a <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> assay (flow chamber). NS- 1 transfection causes endothelial activation and enhanced expression of ICAM- 1 (CD 54 : mean ± standard deviation: NS 1 -GFP vs. control-GFP: 85. 3 ± 11. 2 vs. 61. 6 ± 8. 1; P< 0. 05) and induces endothelial expression of EMMPRIN/CD 147 (CD 147 : mean ± SEM: NS 1 -GFP vs. control-GFP: 114 ± 15. 3 vs. 80 ± 0. 91; P< 0. 05) compared to control-GFP transfected cells. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> assays showed that adhesion of platelets is significantly enhanced on NS 1 transfected ECs when compared to control-GFP (P< 0. 05). The transfection of ECs was verified simultaneously through flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. CONCLUSIONS: GFP color reporter gene shows transfection of ECs and may help to visualize NS 1 -PVB 19 induced endothelial activation and platelet adhesion as well as an enhanced monocyte adhesion directly, providing in vitro evidence of possible microcirculatory dysfunction in PVB 19 -induced myocarditis and, thus, myocardial tissue damage...|$|E

Adhesion to fibronectin by αvβ 3 supports extensive actin cytoskeletal reorganization through the actin-severing protein cofilin, resulting in a single broad lamellipod with static cell–matrix adhesions at the leading edge. Adhesion by α 5 β 1 instead leads to the phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin, and these cells fail to polarize their cytoskeleton but extend thin protrusions containing highly <b>dynamic</b> cell–matrix <b>adhesions</b> in multiple directions. The activity of the small GTPase RhoA is particularly high in cells adhering by α 5 β 1, and inhibition of Rho signaling causes a switch from a β 1 - to a β 3 -associated mode of migration, whereas increased Rho activity has the opposite effect. Thus, alterations in integrin expression profiles allow cells to modulate several critical aspects of the motile machinery through Rho GTPases...|$|R

It contains a rotor assembly running precisely under control to cut a neutron beam into designed pulses. There {{are a number of}} requirements for the rotor assembly to function rightly. The work described in this paper is on design and developing of the rotor assembly. Main content includes structure consideration, numerical calculation of the rotating part stress, test of resin composite <b>adhesion,</b> <b>dynamic</b> balancing process, as well as system operation result.

40|$|Wiskott-Aldrich {{syndrome}} protein (WASp) is a hematopoietic-specific, multidomain protein whose mutation {{is responsible}} for the immunodeficiency disorder Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. WASp contains a binding motif for the Rho GTPase CDC 42 Hs as well as verprolin/cofilin-like actin-regulatory domains, but no specific actin structure regulated by CDC 42 Hs-WASp has been identified. We found that WASp colocalizes with CDC 42 Hs and actin in the core of podosomes, a highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> structure of human blood-derived macrophages. Microinjection of constitutively active V 12 CDC 42 Hs or a constitutively active WASp fragment consisting of the verprolin/cofilin-like domains led to the disassemly of podosomes. Conversely, macrophages from patients expressing truncated forms of WASp completely lacked podosomes. These findings indicate that WASp controls podosome assembly and, in cooperation with CDC 42 Hs, podosome disassembly in primary human macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Multivalent {{interactions}} occur {{frequently in}} nature, where they mediate high-affinity interactions between cells, proteins, or molecules. Here, {{we report on}} a method to generate multivalent aptamers (Multi-Aptamers) that target L-selectin function using rolling circle amplification (RCA). We find that the L-selectin Multi-Aptamers have increased affinity compared to the monovalent aptamer, are specific to L-selectin, and are capable of inhibiting interactions with endogenous ligands. In addition, the Multi-Aptamers efficiently inhibit L-selectin mediated <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> in vitro and homing to secondary lymphoid tissues in vivo. Importantly, our method of generating multivalent materials using RCA avoids many of the challenges associated with current multivalent materials in that the Multi-Aptamers are high affinity, easily produced and modified, and biocompatible. We anticipate that the Multi-Aptamers {{can serve as a}} platform technology to modulate diverse cellular processes...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} unique {{physical}} features of cell adhesion to external surfaces is the active generation of mechanical force at the cell-material interface. This includes pulling forces generated by contractile polymer bundles and networks, and pushing forces generated by the polymerization of polymer networks. These forces are transmitted to the substrate mainly by focal adhesions, which are large, yet highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> clusters. Tissue cells use these forces to sense the physical properties of their environment and {{to communicate with each}} other. The effect of forces is intricately linked to the material properties of cells and their physical environment. Here a review is given of recent progress in our understanding of the role of forces in cell adhesion from the viewpoint of theoretical soft matter physics and in close relation to the relevant experiments.

40|$|Basal {{cells of}} {{stratified}} epidermis are {{anchored to the}} basement membrane zone (BMZ) of skin via hemidesmosomes. We previously identified integrin alpha 3 beta 1, in focal adhesions (FAs), of cultured human keratinocytes (HFKs) as a mediator of HFK adhesion to secreted BMZ-like extracellular matrix (ECM; Carter, W. G., E. A. Wayner, T. S. Bouchard, and P. Kaur. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110 : 1387 - 1404). Here, we have examined the relation of integrins alpha 6 beta 4 and alpha 3 beta 1, to bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPA), a component of hemidesmosomes. We conclude that alpha 6 beta 4 in HFKs localizes in a new stable anchoring contact (SAC) that cooperates with alpha 3 beta 1 - FAs to mediate adhesion to ECM, based on the following. (a) Comparison of secreted ECM, with exogenous laminin, fibronectin and collagen identified ECM as the preferred ligand for HFK adhesion and spreading and for formation of both alpha 6 beta 4 -SACs and alpha 3 beta 1 -FAs. (b) Inhibition of HFK adhesion with combined anti-alpha 3 beta 1 (P 1 B 5) and anti-alpha 6 beta 4 (GoH 3) antibodies indicated that both receptors were functional in adhesion to ECM while alpha 3 beta 1 played a dominant role in spreading. (c) alpha 6 beta 4 colocalized with BPA in SACs that were proximal to but excluded from FAs. Both alpha 6 beta 4 - SACs and alpha 3 beta 1 -FAs were {{in contact with the}} adhesion surface as indicated by antibody exclusion and interference reflection microscopy. (d) In contrast to alpha 3 beta 1 -FAs, alpha 6 beta 4 -SACs were present only in nonmotile cells, not associated with stress fibers, and were relatively stable to detergents and urea, suggesting a nonmotile, or anchoring function for SACs and motility functions for alpha 3 beta 1 -FAs. (e) alpha 6 beta 4 formed a detergent-insoluble complex with exogenous ECM in an affinity isolation procedure, confirming the ability of an unidentified ECM ligand to interact with alpha 6 beta 4. (f) We suggest that alpha 6 beta 4 /BPA-SACs in culture restrict migration of HFKs on ECM while alpha 3 beta 1 -FAs form <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesions</b> in spreading and migrating cells. alpha 6 beta 4 /BPA-SACs in culture bear functional and compositional similarities to hemidesmosomes in skin...|$|R

This paper presents the details of <b>dynamic</b> transportation and <b>adhesion</b> of NPs to a vascular wall under shear flow determined using DPD simulations. Parameters such as bonding time and the mean-square displacement of NPs are considered. Results obtained for spherical NPs with different binding forces and diameters and for NPs with different shapes or aspect ratios but the same volume are compared to assess the influence of such parameters on the binding of NPs to a vascular wall.|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has become}} clear that {{trafficking}} of integrins to late endosomes is key to the regulation of integrin expression and function during cell migration. Here we discuss the molecular machinery that dictates whether integrins are sorted to recycling endosomes or are targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes. Integrins and other receptors that are sorted to late endosomes are not necessarily degraded and, under certain circumstances, can be spared destruction and returned to the cell surface to drive cell migration and invasion. We will discuss how the exchange of adhesion receptors and other key regulators of cell migration between late endosomes/lysosomes and the plasma membrane can promote <b>dynamic</b> turnover of <b>adhesions</b> during cell migration...|$|R
40|$|Podosomes are <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> {{structures}} {{found in}} dendritic cells (DCs) and other {{cells of the}} myeloid lineage. We previously showed that prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), an important proinflammatory mediator produced during DC maturation, induces podosome disassembly within minutes after stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that this response is mediated by cAMP elevation, occurs downstream of Rho kinase and is dependent on myosin II. Whereas PGE 2 stimulation leads to activation of the small GTPase RhoA, decreased levels of Rac 1 -GTP and Cdc 42 -GTP are observed. These results show that PGE 2 stimulation leads to activation of the RhoA-Rho-kinase axis to promote actomyosin-based contraction and subsequent podosome dissolution. Because podosome disassembly is accompanied by de novo formation of focal adhesions, we propose that the disassembly/formation of these two different adhesion structures is oppositely regulated by actomyosin contractility and relative activities of RhoA, Rac 1 and Cdc 42...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. FE 65 binds to the Alzheimer amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP), but the function of this interaction has not been identified. Here, we report that APP and FE 65 are involved in regulation of cell movement. APP and FE 65 colocalize with actin and Mena, an Ablassociated signaling protein thought to regulate actin dynamics, in lamellipodia. APP and FE 65 specifically concentrate with � 1 -integrin in <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> sites known as focal complexes, but not in more static adhesion sites known as focal adhesions. Overexpression of APP accelerates cell migration in an MDCK cell wound–healing assay. Coexpression of APP and FE 65 dramatically enhances the effect of APP on cell movement, probably by regulating the amount of APP at the cell surface. These data are consistent with a role for FE 65 and APP, possibly in a Mena-containing macromolecular complex, in regulation of actin-based motility...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this {{manuscript}} we develop a fluid-cell interaction and adhesion algorithm applied to modeling the cell coating of artificial surfaces of cardiovascular implants for improved biocompatibility. The fluid-cell interaction and adhesion algorithm proposed in {{this manuscript}} is a multi-scale model that captures {{the process of}} cell adhesion which occurs at a scale of a few nano meters, and couples it with fluid-cell interaction which occurs at a scale {{of a few hundred}} microns. Cells are assumed rigid and neutrally buoyant. Cell adhesion is modeled using a a kinetics-based <b>dynamic</b> <b>adhesion</b> algorithm. Fluid-cell interaction is modeled using the fictitious domain method with distributed Lagrange multipliers. The coupling between the two is achieved through a time-splitting scheme. Novel results regarding the influence of certain fluid dynamics parameters and adhesion parameters on the generation of a stable and strong tissue coating of artificial surfaces are presented. The modular nature of this algorithm makes it easily applicable to a large class of problems involvin...|$|E
40|$|Cells in {{the human}} body come across many types of information, which they respond to. Both {{material}} chemistry and topography of the surface where they adhere have an effect on cell shape, proliferation, migration, and gene expression. It is possible to create surfaces with topography at the nanometric scale to allow observation of cell-topography interactions. Previous work has shown that 100 -nm-diameter pits on a 300 -nm pitch can have a marked effect in reducing the adhesion of rat fibroblasts in static cultures. In the present study, a flow of cell suspension was used to investigate cell adhesion onto nanopits in dynamic conditions, by means of a parallel-plate flow chamber. A flow chamber with inner nanotopography has been designed, which allows real-time observation of the flow over the nanopits. A nanopitted pattern was successfully embossed into polymethylmethacrylate to meet the required shape of the chamber. <b>Dynamic</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> after 1 h has been quantified and compared on flat and nanopitted polymethylmethacrylate substrates. The nanopits were seen to be significantly less adhesive than the flat substrates (p< 0. 001), which is coherent with previous observations of static cultures...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation {{monitoring}} (QCM-D) {{was used}} to distinguish the <b>dynamic</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> behavior of human normal (Nthy) thyroid epithelial cells from poorly differentiated anaplastic carcinoma cells (ARO). The surfaces used to facilitate cell adhesion were bare titanium (Ti), gold (Au) and fibrinogen-coated gold (Fg-Au). The pattern of cell adhesion for both cell lines was that the largest acoustic signals were observed on Ti, followed by Au and last by Fg-Au; in addition, ARO cells always produced smaller acoustic signals than Nthy cells on the same surface and for {{the same number of}} cells in suspension. Moreover, the calculated acoustic ratio of energy dissipation over frequency change suggests a higher ability of Nthy cells to spread and potentially form more attachment points on the surface than the ARO cells, something observed in SEM images. Finally, we demonstrated that the application of two surfaces for cell adhesion experiments, one of which is Au and the other either Ti or Fg-Au, can discriminate with accuracy between the two particular cell types and potentially form a platform for differentiation between normal and cancer thyroid cell types...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cellular}} {{phospholipid membrane}} {{plays an important}} role in cell function and cell−cell communication, but its biocomplexity and dynamic nature presents a challenge for examining cellular uptake of phospholipids and the resultant effects on cell function.
