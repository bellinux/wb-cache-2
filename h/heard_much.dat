5|$|The {{first stage}} of the tour's {{itinerary}} took the family, via Munich and Frankfurt, to Brussels {{and then on to}} Paris where they stayed for five months. They then departed for London, where during a stay of more than a year Wolfgang made the acquaintance of some of the leading musicians of the day, <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> music, and composed his first symphonies. The family then moved on to the Netherlands, where the schedule of performances was interrupted by the illnesses of both children, although Wolfgang continued to compose prolifically. The homeward phase incorporated a second stop in Paris and a trip through Switzerland, before the family's return to Salzburg in November 1766.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes piano {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} in jazz {{in the late}} 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the instrument in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification allowed him to be <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> more easily in groups {{when compared to the}} piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the next few years, including playing it through a wah wah. Another former Davis sideman, Chick Corea started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s, as did Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. From 1969's In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew onwards, the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s. Vince Guaraldi started using a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both a piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for A Charlie Brown Christmas and other Peanuts / Charlie Brown films.|$|E
25|$|The eastern whipbird (Psophodes olivaceus) is an insectivorous {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} {{the east coast of}} Australia, its whip-crack call a familiar sound in forests of eastern Australia. Two subspecies are recognised. <b>Heard</b> <b>much</b> more often than seen, it is a dark olive-green and black in colour with a distinctive white cheek patch and crest. The male and female are similar in plumage.|$|E

The court <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> the same testimony as in the committal hearings. However, it appeared that Terence had initially been somewhat confused about the sequence of events. The prosecution claimed that Dennis was tied to a bench and beaten with a stick for eating a swede the day before he died.|$|E
500|$|The Southern Boobook is a mainly nocturnal species, though may {{be active}} {{at dawn and}} dusk. It is <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> more {{commonly}} than seen, being particularly vocal in breeding season. The characteristic two-note boo-book call or hoot can be heard up to [...] away, the second note generally lower than the first. Calling takes place from sunset through till dawn, generally with a peak in the two hours after dusk and just before dawn. It can continue for several hours. The male's hooting is higher pitched and of shorter duration—and is <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> more commonly—than that of the female. He uses it as a contact call and to advertise his territory to females, as well as when bringing food to his mate or even before mating. Birds give a harsher version of the call when mobbing intruders. Both sexes—though mainly the female—give a single monosyllabic hoot as an alarm call or warning. Southern boobooks also make a repetitive croaking or grunting call while courting, mating or greeting, or {{as a response to}} other boobooks hooting. Birds may switch from croaks to hoots seamlessly. Males generally croak {{at the beginning of the}} evening, and when arriving at the nest with food. A purring or braying call is used by both sexes as a contact call around the nest and (more quietly) when bringing food to nestlings, or by the female to beg for food from the male. The female makes a low trill during courtship and nesting. Growls, high-pitched yelps and screeches can be made when attacking intruders.|$|E
500|$|The San Diego Padres drafted Hamilton eighth {{overall in}} the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, making him the highest drafted Atlantic Sun Conference {{baseball}} player in the league's history. He eventually {{signed a contract with}} the Padres worth $415,000 after a short period in which Hamilton refused to sign a contract. He was surprised upon hearing of his selection, saying [...] "It came as a bit of a shock because I really hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> from the Padres." [...] According to Hamilton's mother, Hamilton only signed the deal because his father Jack was dying of cancer, and it had been his father's dream to watch his son pitch in the major leagues. Following the draft, Hamilton joined Team USA in Canada in preparation for the Olympics.|$|E

2500|$|Prefontaine {{wanted to}} stay in-state for college [...] and attend the University of Oregon. He had not <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> from Bill Bowerman, the head coach for the University of Oregon. Prefontaine only {{received}} letters from Oregon once a month whereas other universities such as Villanova were persistent in recruiting him. As a result, Prefontaine {{did not know how}} much Bill Bowerman wanted him to attend Oregon. Bowerman stated that he did not recruit Prefontaine differently from anyone else. It was a matter of principle for him to advise recruits where to attend college, wherever it may be, and to not flood the recruits with correspondence. Bowerman had followed Prefontaine's career since he was a sophomore and agreed with McClure in his assessment of Steve being a good runner.|$|E
2500|$|The eastern whipbird is {{generally}} shy, and is <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> {{more often than}} seen. Its long drawn out call - a long note, followed by a [...] "whip crack" [...] (which {{is the source of}} the common name) and some follow on notes - is one of the most distinctive sounds of the eastern Australian bush. The call is usually a duet between the male and female, the male producing the long note and whip crack and female the following notes. Calls are most frequent in the early morning, though do occur through the day with small peaks at noon and sunset. Though male calls are consistent across the species range, a high degree of variation in female calls has been reported. The call samples were used (and can be heard) e.g. in the Bush Christmas 1983 movie.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{admirer of}} Verdi, she created {{the title role}} of Alzira in 1845 and sang {{in some of the}} {{earliest}} performances of four of his other operas: Griselda in I Lombardi alla prima crociata, Elvira in Ernani, Odabella in Attila, and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. She in turn was admired by Verdi's wife, Giuseppina Strepponi, who termed her [...] "one of the greatest talents we possess". In 1844 she sang in the Vienna premiere of Ernani after which, the composer <b>heard</b> (<b>much</b> to his annoyance) that she had substituted her Act I cavatina, [...] "Ernani! Ernani, involami" [...] with Giselda's cavatina [...] "Non fu sogno" [...] from I Lombardi alla prima crociata. [...] Nevertheless, the Vienna premiere was a resounding success, even without the original cavatina, and Verdi was determined to have her as his first Alzira. He even delayed the rehearsals until she recovered from the birth of her child. In 1848, however, he wanted her to be replaced as Lady Macbeth for the first Naples performance of Macbeth on the grounds that her voice and appearance were too beautiful. In his often quoted letter to Salvadore Cammarano, which he wanted passed on to the Teatro San Carlo management, Verdi wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|As Secretary, Cisneros {{attacked}} head on fair housing policies. [...] “Fair housing,” he told Guy Gugliotta of the Washington Post, “is so {{vital that}} we cannot accomplish {{any of the}} other goals without it.” [...] He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. [...] When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by letting them know that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. [...] The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros's four-year term, the agency's decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. [...] "The train started to run on time," [...] with complaints being <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. [...] "It's hard to find somebody in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cabinet which Papen formed {{was known}} as the [...] "cabinet of barons" [...] or as the [...] "cabinet of monocles" [...] and was widely {{regarded}} with ridicule by Germans. Papen had virtually no support in the Reichstag; the only parties committed to supporting him was the far-right/national conservative German National People's Party (DNVP) and German People's Party. However, Papen became very close to Hindenburg. The French Ambassador André François-Poncet reported to his superiors in the Quai d'Orsay about Papen's influence on Hindenburg that [...] "It's he [...] who is the preferred one, the favorite of the Marshal; he diverts the old man through his vivacity, his playfulness; he flatters him by showing him respect and devotion; he beguiles him with his daring; he is in [...] eyes the perfect gentleman." [...] Papen first met Hitler in June 1932, and found him a ridiculous figure. Papen always spoke his German with an aristocratic, Westphalian accent and found Hitler with his lower-class Austrian accent of German to be an absurd man, deserving only of contempt. Papen wrote about his meeting with Hitler:"I found him curiously unimpressive. I could detect no inner quality which might explain his extraordinary hold on the masses. He was wearing a dark blue suit and seemed the complete petite-bourgeous. He had an unhealthy complexion, and with his little moustache and curious hair style had an indefinable bohemian quality. His demeanor was modest and polite, and although I had <b>heard</b> <b>much</b> about the magnetic quality of his eyes, I do not remember being impressed by them...As he talked about his party's aims I was struck by the fanatical insistence with which he presented his arguments. I realized that the fate of my Government would depend to a large extent on the willingness of this man and his followers to back me up, and that this would be the most difficult problem with which I should have to deal. He {{made it clear that he}} would not be content with a subordinate role and intended in due course to demand plenary powers for himself. 'I regard your Cabinet only as a temporary solution, and will continue my efforts to make my party the strongest in the country. The Chancellorship will then devolve on me', he said".|$|E
