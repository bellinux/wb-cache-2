25|$|Between 2006 and 2007 {{junction}} 10 near Ashford was remodelled {{to increase}} capacity when the bridges across the motorway were modified to provide three lanes of traffic at the roundabout, and local approach roads were widened, with new traffic lights to control traffic flows at the junction between the A292 Hythe Road and the London-bound M20 <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> A new footbridge was also constructed across the motorway. The cost was £4.9 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{northbound}} <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> at Lancaster (junction 34) {{was unusually}} short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune {{at this point}} and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer slip road. This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning slip roads with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.|$|E
50|$|Improvements to Junction 10 of the M40 {{have also}} been {{designed}} to support NW Bicester and improve links with Silverstone and Brackley. The improvements are due to start in 2015 and will cost around £1.3 million. Work will involve replacing the current southbound <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> and widening the A43 southbound.|$|E
50|$|Initially service {{areas were}} located between {{junctions}} (on-line sites), having their own <b>entry</b> and exit <b>slip</b> <b>roads,</b> {{with a separate}} site for each direction of travel, though a recent trend has been to locate service areas instead at junction sites: the two most recent openings, Wetherby and Beaconsfield, are examples: they are located at A1(M) junction 46, and M40 junction 2 respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{operating}} company must also pay {{the full cost}} of constructing the <b>entry</b> and exit <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and all other features required for safe access to motorway services, as well as the motorway services facility itself. In other countries, the authority responsible for the highway tends to subsidise these costs on the grounds that these areas are partly a public service to drivers. The leases provide that motorway services must operate 24 hours a day, and the costs of providing utilities and services are high. With very few customers in the early morning, they need to earn the money in other ways.|$|R
25|$|These roundabouts do {{not form}} a {{complete}} circle {{and have a}} raindrop or teardrop shape. They appear at U.S. Interstate interchanges to provide a free-flowing left turn to the on-ramps and {{eliminating the need for}} turn signals and lanes. Since the <b>entry</b> and exit <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> are one-way, a complete circle is unnecessary. This means that drivers entering the roundabout from the bridge do not need to give way, and that prevents queuing on narrow, two-lane bridges. These roundabouts have been used at dumbbell roundabout junctions, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. Several junctions along Interstate 70 near Avon, Colorado use teardrop roundabouts.|$|R

50|$|Charnock Richard Services, {{southbound}} side, has {{an unusual}} and unique site layout. It is usual in motorway service areas within the United Kingdom for the fuel forecourt {{to be the}} last facility encountered, before rejoining the motorway. Charnock Richard services has the fuel forecourt sited {{at the top of the}} <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road,</b> i.e., on arrival. Architecture of motorway service areas was then still experimental, and this arrangement was not deemed a success, and therefore not repeated.|$|E

50|$|The crash {{occurred}} on the motorway <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> connecting the westbound M4 motorway to the northbound (clockwise) M25 motorway, at approximately {{the point where the}} <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> merges with the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the eastbound M4. At this point the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> is on a downhill gradient with a right turn with decreasing radius, necessitating a posted advisory speed limit of 40 mph.|$|R

50|$|Weinberg {{was sentenced}} on 24 June 2008. On re-appearing at Aylesbury Crown Court, {{it became known}} that Weinberg had {{returned}} from holiday the day before, and chose to stay up alone all night drinking. The court {{was told that the}} following day Weinburg drove a National Express coach on a regular service from Birmingham to Stansted Airport. While travelling southbound on the M1, Weinberg overtook a lorry on the approach to a motorway junction. He then cut back in front of the lorry, and claimed to have mistaken the service station <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> for that of the actual junction exit slip road. As the coach entered the slip road, its tachograph showed that the coach was travelling at 57 mph. It then hit a kerb, and passengers reported the coach 'took off'. It then rolled on to its side, sliding into a lamp-post and a tree.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{operational experience}} and assessment work during 2002 / 2003, {{in particular the}} approach to ramp metering now operating on the M 6 motorway in the UK Midlands, and further work associated with the ramp metering business case. Ramp metering is a traffic control system which uses traffic signals on the <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> (or 'ramp') to control the traffic joining the motorway from the slip road...|$|E
40|$|Weaving {{sections}} {{are formed}} when a merge area is closely {{followed by a}} diverging area, or when an <b>entry</b> <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> is closely followed by an exit slip road and the two are joined by an auxiliary lane. Driving in the weaving section involves complex car-following and lane-changing interactions. This paper presents two empirical data collection and data extraction processes based on traffic surveillance camera and loop detector measurements. It examines {{the quality of the}} extracted data, and highlights the possible sources of measurement errors considering that the speed and acceleration are varied significantly. This paper proposes locally weighted regression method for data cleaning and presents example results to demonstrate the method by combining the two data sources. The study succeeds in identifying some key driving characteristics of vehicles in the weaving section. We found that 25. 25 % of the weaving movements took place in the first 50 - 100 meters from the point of merge. Around 30 % of the total traffic involved in one lane-changing movement. Meanwhile, the transit time for the driver with more than one lane-changing is 4. 09 sec in average. The appearance of auxiliary lane in the weaving section provides further opportunity to delay the lane-changing, which affects the traffic performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project has brought fresh {{knowledge of the}} efficiency and traffic quality of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at multilevel junctions. The results were obtained from observations of the traffic flow at <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to urban expressways (Class B). Various types were studied: single-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane and three-lane main roads (type E 1 /E 2) and two-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane main roads (type E 4 /E 5). Speeds were always restricted to 80 km/h or 100 km/h at the measuring points observed.

40|$|The Purpose of this Bachelor thesis was to {{find out}} the traffic {{accidents}} occurrence on the road R 10. This road was renamed as Highway D 10 since the 1 st January 2016. Highway R 10 begins in Prague and its finish is in Turnov. I focused the traffic accidents, which are related to <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits in year 2013. For the research I used the geographic information system ArcGIS, where I exactly drew the accidents on the highway. Information about the accidents I received from the sources from Police of the Czech Republic. I selected only the accidents, which are related to the highway´s <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits. Based on the analyses I found out, how the length of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exists is to the number of the traffic accidents in these highway sections. Discovered facts could be helpful for projecting of the new <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits or for adjustments of the existing sections as well...|$|R
