Following {{on the heels of}} the ongoing regulatory and political debate as to the merits of financial advice, we focus in this paper on three key issues. First, we examine whether collaboration with <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> attains to better performing portfolios. Second, we investigate whether involvement of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> mitigates the costly investment mistakes. Third, we document whether <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> provide asset allocation recommendations that market time. Econometric analysis that is corrected for the endogeneity of making use of financial advice suggests that collaboration with <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> lowers portfolio returns, increases portfolio risk, and ends up in poor market timing than the case when individuals manage their accounts on their own. Nevertheless, involvement of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> helps investors to attenuate the costly investment mistakes such as underdiversification, home bias and portfolio churning. Overall, this paper implies that financial advice lacks quality in some tangible dimensions; however, it is, at the end, the customer who gauges the added value of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background – Due to the {{increased}} complexity of the Swedish financial market, {{the increased}} demand for financial services and the increased number of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors,</b> the role of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> is important on the financial market. The external control from Finansinspektionen has been increased in order to eliminate rogue advisors and this type of control often affects employees’ motivation in a negative way. Because of the important role <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> have on the financial market, {{it is essential that}} they are motivated in order to perform well in their profession.   Purpose – The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how the external control affects the work motivation of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> and how motivational factors could be used when designing a management control system in a context characterized by high external control. To answer this purpose, this thesis answers these following three research questions: What do <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> perceive to be the most effective motivational factors? How does the external control influence the motivation of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors?</b> How could the work be designed to maximize the motivation of <b>financial</b> <b>advisors?</b> Method – In order to fulfill the purpose of this study, we have a qualitative approach were we conducted ten semi-structured interviews with <b>financial</b> <b>advisors.</b> The <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> are working at two large Swedish financial advisory companies. Findings/Conclusion – After analyzing the empirical data, with relevant theories, interesting findings were made. In general, the external control from Finansinspektionen is interpreted as unmotivating by <b>financial</b> <b>advisors.</b> To counter this, it is important that the employers invest resources to develop IT-systems that minimize the time spent on these work tasks. The administrative work, which arises from the external control, would become more effective and not so time consuming. The management control systems must be designed so that they maximize the motivation of the advisors. Employers must also use correctly designed reward systems in order to have motivated employees. Practical Implications – This study contributes to important findings for managers in Swedish financial advisory companies. Since the management control systems could be designed in another way to maximize the motivation of the <b>financial</b> <b>advisors,</b> this study is an important contribution to the financial sector, where the <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> operate...|$|R

Upon the advice of Irving Leonard, his <b>financial</b> <b>advisor,</b> he changed talent agencies to the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957.

This differential is more pronounced for distributions that have large tax implications and are hard-to-predict. Furthermore, the differential gets stronger in December but only when investors face large capital losses, consistent with <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> helping the former investors engage in tax-loss selling...|$|R

40|$|A central {{tenet of}} the {{financial}} services industry in Australia and abroad is the measurement and categorisation of investor’s financial risk tolerances. Recent reforms to the industry now require <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> to directly question investors about their risk tolerance. Prior to these reforms, <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> used heuristics to categorise investors into different classes or categories of risk tolerance. In order to determine if these reforms are fruitful, and if <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> heuristics are systematically inept, we utilised a psychometrically validated risk tolerance questionnaire composed of direct questions and demographic information. Firstly, we constructed two categories (broad and narrow) of heuristically determined risk tolerances that <b>financial</b> <b>advisors</b> may employ. Secondly, we compared these heuristically determined categories against each investor’s response to four direct questions. Our results indicate that misclassification of risk tolerance categorisation is severe under both broad and narrow categories, with the main influences being the number of categories and type of direct question. In the main, <b>financial</b> <b>advisor’s</b> use of heuristics in categorising investor’s risk tolerances is inefficient, {{and in some cases}} grossly under (over) estimates an investor’s actual risk tolerance...|$|R
