5|$|Conditions {{were dry}} for {{qualifying}} on Saturday afternoon. Qualifying {{consisted of three}} parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Only the two Mercedes <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{was held}} on 13–14 June, with two two-hour {{sessions}} each night; one run at dusk, the other in darkness. New <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> again required to run a set number of laps to learn the circuit and be allowed to race: three in daylight and three at night. The best overall time from all four sessions determined the starting grid.|$|E
5|$|The BBC then {{licensed}} {{the product}} to {{a small number of}} private sector companies. Production began in 1975. In 1987, as a result of reassessment of the product due to consistency issues in the manufacture of the mid–bass driver, the <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> modified and the crossover changed. The overall impedance of the crossover fell to 11ohms from the original 15ohms.|$|E

5|$|The Saturday morning {{sessions}} {{were held in}} dry conditions and later on a wet track, were grip was poor and some <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> forced onto the grass after sliding off the track. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session, {{with a time of}} 1:11.355; Coulthard had the second fastest time. The two Ferrari <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> third and fourth; Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Verstappen continued his quick form and set the fifth fastest time, ahead of Fisichella and Villeneuve. Zonta, Trulli and Herbert rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the final practice session, Häkkinen again set the fastest time, a 1:11.336, despite spinning into the gravel late in the session; his teammate Coulthard remained second quickest. Michael Schumacher was third fastest ahead of teammate Barrichello. Villeneuve was fifth fastest, ahead of Herbert and Frentzen. Salo, Fisichella and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> {{able to go out}} on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to go out in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time towards the end of the session.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:21.370, ahead of teammate Häkkinen who was two-tenths of a second slower. Ralf Schumacher (with a time of 1:21.604) was third quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher and Villeneuve. Fisichella and Frentzen followed in sixth and seventh. The two Arrows <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> eighth and ninth (with Verstappen ahead of Pedro de la Rosa). Mika Salo rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session, Michael Schumacher used {{a new set of}} tyres and set the fastest time of 1:21.088; Coulthard finished with the second quickest lap. Barrichello was third fastest, in front of Häkkinen who struggled with a lack of grip and a loose rear end. Ralf Schumacher recorded the fifth fastest time. The Jordan <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> sixth and seventh (with Trulli in front of Frentzen). de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Button completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|A second {{accident}} {{occurred on}} October 11, 2010, in Washington, D.C. While filming a chase scene at 3rd Street and Maryland Avenue, SW, a Metropolitan Police K9 Unit SUV accidentally rammed the Camaro that portrays Bumblebee in the film. The area {{had been closed}} off by the Washington, D.C., police, and it is unclear why the SUV was there. Both <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> uninjured, but the Camaro was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, {{planning}} {{continued for}} widening the remaining portion of SR76 west of I-15, {{due to the}} frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> at fault. The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along {{the route of the}} old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> not listed, Tom Kristensen's {{injury in}} the opening round of the 2007 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season made his {{participation}} in the race questionable. As the driver with the most wins at Le Mans, he {{was intended to be}} part of Audi's factory team. Fellow Audi DTM driver Mattias Ekström was nominated as his possible replacement by Audi. However, on 11 June 2007 Kristensen was cleared by doctors to race, leaving Ekström's services unneeded.|$|E

5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} at this race {{proved to be}} a major turning point in both the 1994 season, and in the development of Formula One itself, particularly with regard to safety. The race weekend was marked by the deaths of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna in separate accidents. Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello injured and several mechanics and spectators injured. In terms of driver fatalities, this was Formula One's darkest weekend since two <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> killed at the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday sessions were held in dry and cloudy conditions, becoming damp during the day, resulting in the track surface becoming slippery. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 43.532 seconds, almost six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello was just off Häkkinen's pace with Coulthard setting the fourth fastest time. Frentzen and BAR driver Ricardo Zonta followed in fifth and sixth positions respectively. Fisichella, Mika Salo, Ralf Schumacher and Herbert completed the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Williams driver Jenson Button crashed into the pit lane {{at the end of}} the barriers and lost his front wing. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher did not manage to improve his lap time but was still quickest. Frentzen was running quicker and was second fastest. The two McLaren <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> running slower—Häkkinen in third and Coulthard fifth–although both <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> undertaking race set-up and brake performance testing. They were separated by Barrichello. Trulli was sixth fastest, ahead of Zonta. Villeneuve, Fisichella and Salo followed in the top ten.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton won the race, passing Nico Rosberg in {{the later}} stages, and thereby secured his third Drivers' Championship, as Sebastian Vettel {{finished}} third. An incident-packed race saw only twelve cars reach the finish line, with Max Verstappen repeating his best result {{of the season in}} fourth and Jenson Button finishing a season-best sixth. After starting in damp conditions, both Red Bull <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> initially able to challenge the Mercedes for the lead, but later dropped back as the track dried, with Daniil Kvyat retiring after a crash and Daniel Ricciardo eventually finishing tenth.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} final race of the season, two <b>drivers</b> <b>were</b> still in {{contention}} for the World Drivers' Championship. Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher was leading with 78 points; Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve was second with 77 points, one point behind Schumacher. Behind Schumacher and Villeneuve in the Drivers' Championship, Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third on 41 points in the other Williams, with Jean Alesi and David Coulthard on 36 and 30 points respectively. Villeneuve had won two more races than Schumacher during the season, meaning that {{in the event of}} a tie on points, the rules stated Villeneuve would be world champion.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient, so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell.
