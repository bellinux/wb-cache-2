50|$|One {{issue is}} what the {{predominant}} shapes are. If the image is of a <b>fill-in</b> <b>form,</b> then it will probably have just vertical and horizontal lines of a constant width. The program's vectorization should take that into account. On the other hand, a CAD drawing may have lines at any angle, there may be curved lines, {{and there may be}} several line weights (thick for objects and thin for dimension lines). Instead of (or in addition to) curves, the image may contain outlines filled with the same color. Adobe Streamline allows users to select a combination of line recognition (horizontal and vertical lines), centerline recognition, or outline recognition. Streamline also allows outline shapes that are small to be thrown out; the notion is such small shapes are noise. The user may set the noise level between 0 and 1000; an outline that has fewer pixels than that setting is discarded.|$|E

The aim of the present two studies was to gain deeper insight into what constitutes exploratory learning and to assess {{the effects of a}} number of instructional support measures. The domain involved was control theory at the university level. In the first study we made an inventory of exploratory learning processes by observing 17 students working with a computer simulation and analyzing students' thinking-aloud protocols. Subjects received a structured assignment with hints as an instructional support measure. In the second study, 91 students received an open-ended assignment with instructional support that consisted of an information sheet and a set of <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms.</b> On both sheets and forms, six cells were presented. A cell was given for each of the following six learning processes: identifying variables and parameters, generating hypotheses, designing an experiment, predicting, interpreting data, and drawing of conclusions. Information sheets were either of a domain specific or of a general nature. The set of <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms</b> were either free or had the cell HYPOTHESIS already filled in. The statements of the students on the <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms</b> were analyzed in a stepwise order. Twenty-two detailed learning processes were identified and classified. Two of the main classes of processes are transformative and regulative. Both studies showed that students were reluctant to apply learning processes that are considered characteristic for exploratory learning. Furthermore, students had problems with the exploratory learning processes, especially with the processes of generating hypotheses, interpreting data, and drawing conclusions. Effects of the instructional support measures were not conclusive. Hints did not result in significant improvements of the study process. Supporting learning processes with information sheets appeared to help students in performing learning processes, but no different effects of domain specific and general information could be found. Students who were provided with hypotheses showed a higher global activity level and higher scores in domain correctness of their learning processes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the risk of}} antepartum depression (APD) among pregnant women. In particular stress before pregnancy, stress during pregnancy, marital relationship, social support, husband’s mental status and monthly expenditure. The subjects consisted of 580 pregnant women in the third trimester, who attended antenatal care at the Department of Obstetrics of the Persahabatan Hospital Jakarta from November 1, 1999 to August 15, 2001. Antepartum depression was screened by a psychiatrist using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Information on demographic and personal characteristics were collected from <b>fill-in</b> <b>form.</b> Through this form, the respondent gave information on stress before and during pregnancy, and from questionnaires Kuestioner Dukungan Sosial (KDS), Kesesuaian Hubungan Suami Istri (KHSI) and the Symptom Check List- 90 (SCL- 90) information about social support, marital relationship, and husband’s mental status were collected respectively. The prevalence of APD was 18 %. Antepartum depression and non-antepartum depression were similar in terms of age groups, level of education, occupations, monthly expenditures, number of pregnancies, number of children, number of deliveries, physical health condition, and history of premenstrual syndromes. Pregnant women with stress before pregnancy had a two-fold risk of APD [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 04; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 1. 12 – 3. 74] compared to pregnant women without stress before pregnancy. In addition, when compared to pregnant women without stress during pregnancy, those with stress during pregnancy had 2. 2 -fold risk of developing APD (adjusted OR= 2. 13, 95 % CI: 1, 27 - 3, 74). In conclusion, stress before and during pregnancy increased the risk antepartum depression. Therefore, attention should be paid to pregnant women with these risk factors.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the self-reported prevalence {{of domestic violence}} and associated risk factors in the Sivas province of Turkey. Method: Five hundred and eighty-three households were chosen by the method of stratified random sampling. The average age among women was 28. 65 [*]±[*] 4. 64. A total of 45. 3 % of women were in 30 - 34 age-group, 76. 5 % were housewives, and 91. 2 % were married. The data were gathered by performing face-to-face interviews in participants’ homes. Demographic data were obtained by <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms.</b> Results: We found a statistically significant relationship among the types of violence and annual income, type of family, education and occupation level of women, education level of perpetrators, watching violent films, and childhood experience of emotional abuse or negligence. Fifty-two percent of women were exposed {{to at least one}} type of violence. Verbal violence was the most frequent type of violence (53. 8 %), followed by physical violence (38. 3 %). About 45 % of women exposed to violence were in the 30 - 34 age group, 41. 6 % completed only primary schools, 73. 6 % were housewives, 91. 7 % were married, 71. 0 % had been exposed to violence during their childhood, and 45. 2 %, had been exposed to violence several times in a month.

40|$|Exploratory {{learning}} with computer simulations is {{an approach that}} fits well within the current emphasis on viewing the learner as an active, constructive person. In previous studies we concluded that a valid performance of exploratory learning processes was a bottleneck and especially the process of hypothesis generation posed difficulties to learners. The major objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of supporting hypothesis generation by offering structured overviews of predefined hypotheses. Subjects were 88 Mechanical Engineering students working in pairs, with a computer simulation program for control theory. Two experimental groups and one control group received an open-ended assignment for exploring a given modelled system. The major means of support that the experimental groups received was a structured overview of hypotheses. These overviews offered a list of, basically, the same set of eight predefined hypotheses from which subjects could choose. Two variations were designed: the controller structure followed types of controllers of increasing complexity and the concept structure organised the hypotheses according to fundamental domain concepts. The control group received the same assignment, but no support measures. Prior knowledge of all subjects was measured and at the end of the lab they were given a posttest that intended to measure 'deep' knowledge. Subjects worked on so-called 'fill-in forms' and their notes were used for analyzing their learning processes. Results showed that the Controller group scored higher on the posttest than the Concept group and subjects' level of prior knowledge influenced the posttest scores. Analysis of statements on the <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms</b> showed that among others the Controller group designed better (more complete) experiments than the Concept group...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the use of}} the Internet in the research process, from identifying research issues through qualitative research, through using the Web for surveys and clinical trials, to pre-publishing and publishing research results. Material published on the Internet may be a valuable resource for researchers desiring to understand people and the social and cultural contexts within which they live outside of experimental settings, with due emphasis on the interpretations, experiences, and views of `real world' people. Reviews of information posted by consumers on the Internet may help to identify health beliefs, common topics, motives, information, and emotional needs of patients, and point to areas where research is needed. The Internet can further be used for survey research. Internet-based surveys may be conducted by means of interactive interviews or by questionnaires designed for self-completion. Electronic one-to-one interviews can be conducted via e-mail or using chat rooms. Questionnaires can be administered by e-mail (e. g. using mailing lists), by posting to newsgroups, and on the Web using <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms.</b> In "open" web-based surveys, selection bias occurs due to the non-representative nature of the Internet population, and (more importantly) through self-selection of participants, i. e. the non-representative nature of respondents, also called the `volunteer effect'. A synopsis of important techniques and tips for implementing Web-based surveys is given. Ethical issues involved in any type of online research are discussed. Internet addresses for finding methods and protocols are provided. The Web is also being used to assist in the identification and conduction of clinical trials. For example, the web can be used by researchers doing a systematic review who are looking for unpublished trials. Finally, the web is used for two distinct types of electronic publication.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to determine the scope and background of student due process policies and procedures utilized within Indiana school corporations, and to analyze the content of due process policies and procedures utilized within Indiana school corporations in comparison with standards recommended by legal and educational authorities. An Initial Survey form was mailed to the superintendent of each school corporation in Indiana. Superintendents reporting written, school board adopted policies and procedures for student due process were requested to send a copy for the content analysis portion of the study. A Background Survey instrument was mailed to each superintendent providing a copy of due process policies and procedures. Information was sought relative to the formulation, implementation, and utilization of student due process policies and procedures. Recommended standards and guidelines for procedural due process for students, from both legal and educational sources, were reviewed. The standards and guidelines were organized into a recording instrument to help facilitate a content analysis of the policies and procedures. Major findings of the study were: 1. Superintendents from 43 of 280 Indiana school corporations reported written, school board adopted policies and procedures outlining student due process in effect as of December 1, 1971. 2. The total number of school corporations with written, school board adopted due process policies and procedures has increased annually since 1969. 3, The persons most directly affected by discipline and due process [...] students, teachers, and parents [...] were not involved in the formulation of policies and procedures. 4. Approximately 71 per cent of the students involved in due process hearings were reported to have been suspended or expelled. Approximately 29 per cent of the students involved were reported to have been reinstated. 5. The building principal was most often specified as the hearing officer. The school board was most often specified as the hearing board. 6. In most instances, the student and parents received the required information in the notice of the charges; however, most notices lacked an explanation of the procedural mechanics of the hearing. 7. The amount of time allowed the student to prepare a defense was arbitrary or not specified in most policies. 8. As a group, the due process policies were most often lacking ini (a) including a provision for students and/or parents to give a written waiver of formal hearing procedures; (b) including a provision guaranteeing the student prior inspection of documents and evidence; and (c) Including a provision guaranteeing student protection against self-incrimination. 9. The type of hearing record most often reported consisted of <b>fill-in</b> <b>forms</b> or written narrative summaries. 10. Appeals were most often directed to the superintendent. Major recommendations of the study were: 1. Students, parents, and teachers be involved in the formulation of due process policies and procedures. 2. Humanistic aspects of the student-institutional relationship be emphasized in teacher education and school administration courses. 3.

When the linear program is in symmetric form (i. e., the constraints are Ax _ _ 0), then there are two mathematically equivalent forms of the search direction, involving different matrices. One form necessitates factoring a matrix whose sparsity pattern has the same form as that of (AAT). The other form necessitates factoring a matrix whose sparsity pattern has the same form as that of (A-CA). Depending on the structure of the matrix A, one of these two forms may produce significantly less fill-in than the other. Furthermore, by analyzing the <b>fill-in</b> of both <b>forms</b> prior to starting the iterative phase of the algorithm, the form with the least fill-in can be computed and used throughout the algorithm.

The research focused on dynamic query user interfaces, visualization, and overview +preview designs. An operational prototype, using query previews, was implemented with NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), a directory service for earth science data sets. Users can see the histogram of the data distribution over several attributes and choose among attribute values. A result bar shows the cardinality of the result set, thereby preventing users from submitting queries that would have zero hits. Our experience confirmed the importance of metadata accuracy and completeness. The query preview interfaces make visible problems or holes in the metadata that are unnoticeable with classic <b>form</b> <b>fill-in</b> interfaces. This could be seen as a problem, but we think that it will have a long-term beneficial effect on the quality of the metadata as data providers will be compelled to produce more complete and accurate metadata.

40|$|Classification is a {{fundamental}} tool in the organisation of any library collection for effective information retrieval. Several classifications exist, yet the pioneering Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) still constitutes {{the most widely used}} scheme and international de facto standard. Although once used for the dual purpose of physical organisation and subject retrieval in the printed library catalogue, library classification is now relegated to a singular role of shelf location. Numerous studies have highlighted the problem of subject access in library online public access catalogues (OPACs). The library OPAC has changed relatively little since its inception, designed to find what is already known, not discover and explore. This research aims to enhance OPAC subject searching by deriving facets of the DDC and populating these with a library collection for display at a View-based searching OPAC interface. A novel method is devised that enables the automatic deconstruction of complex DDC notations into their component facets. Identifying facets based upon embedded notational components reveals alternative, multidimensional subject arrangements of a library collection and resolves the problem of disciplinary scatter. The extent to which the derived facets enhance users' subject searching perceptions and activities at the OPAC interface is evaluated in a small-scale usability study. The results demonstrate the successful derivation of four fundamental facets (Reference Type, Person Type, Time and Geographic Place). Such facet derivation and deconstruction of Dewey notations is recognised as a complex process, owing to the lack of a uniform notation, notational re-use and the need for distinct facet indicators to delineate facet boundaries. The results of the preliminary usability study indicate that users are receptive to facet-based searching and that the View-based searching system performs equally as well as a current <b>form</b> <b>fill-in</b> interface and, in some cases, provides enhanced benefits. It is concluded that further exploration of facet-based searching is clearly warranted and suggestions for future research are made. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
