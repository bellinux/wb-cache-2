60|$|Holmes was in {{the most}} {{brilliant}} hour of that wonderful second youth which his <b>fame</b> <b>flowered</b> into long after the world thought he had completed the cycle of his literary life. He had already received full recognition as a poet of delicate wit, nimble humor, airy imagination, and exquisite grace, when the Autocrat papers advanced his name indefinitely beyond the bounds which most immortals would have found range enough. The marvel of his invention was still fresh {{in the minds of}} men, and time had not dulled in any measure the sense of its novelty. His readers all fondly identified him with his work; and I fully expected to find myself in the Autocrat's presence when I met Dr. Holmes. But the fascination was none the less for that reason; and the winning smile, the wise and humorous glance, the whole genial manner was as important to me as if I had foreboded something altogether different. I found him physically of the Napoleonic height which spiritually overtops the Alps, and I could look into his face without that unpleasant effort which giants of inferior mind so often cost the man of five feet four.|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} fatty acid methyl esters (<b>FAMEs)</b> of <b>flowering</b> tops of Hypericum scabrum, H. scabroides and H. amblysepalum were identied by gas chromatography. In this work 5 FAMEs for H. scabrum, 9 FAMEs for H. scabroides and 8 FAMEs for H. amblysepalum were identied. The major components were alpha-linolenic (48. 60 %), linoleic (32. 53 %) and oleic (11. 45 %) acids in H. scabrum. Alpha-linolenic (29. 84 %), palmitic (27. 90 %) and oleic (16. 49 %) acids were present in H. scabroides and alpha linolenic (41. 79 %) and palmitic acids (32. 28 %) were found in H. amblysepalum.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the desert rose {{received}} <b>fame</b> in the <b>flower</b> market due to its striking and sculptural forms; however, the commercial production of these species is quite recent and {{little is known about}} its crop management, including substrates recommendation. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of different substrates on desert rose seed germination and production of its seedlings. Experiment I: freshly harvested seeds of desert rose were sown in different substrates e. g. sand, coconut fiber, semi-composted pine bark, sand + coconut fiber, semi-composted pine bark + sand and coconut fiber + semicomposted pine bark. These substrates were evaluated to study the emergence percentage of seeds, initial growth of seedlings and seedling emergence speed index (ESI). Experiment II: desert rose from the experiment I were transferred to plastic pots filled with the same substrates as in experiment I. The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of the substrates were noted every 30 days while the growth parameters of seedlings were recorded after 240 days. Results from experiment I showed higher germination rate and seedling growth in substrates containing semi-composted pine bark. Similarly, in experiment II, better quality seedlings were observed in substrates containing semi-composted pine bark. Thus, for desert rose seed germination and seedling growth, it is recommended to use substrates containing semi-composted pine bark...|$|R
