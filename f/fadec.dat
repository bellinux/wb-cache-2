5|$|The CFM56-4 {{series was}} a {{proposed}} improved {{version of the}} CFM56-2 designed for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Competing with the RJ500 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000lbf (110kN) and was to feature a new 68in (1.73m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital engine controller (<b>FADEC).</b> Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new V2500 engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did not compare favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is highly}} maneuverable at both {{supersonic}} and subsonic speeds. Computerized {{flight control system}} and full-authority digital engine control (<b>FADEC)</b> make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
50|$|The EMB-145 Family of {{aircraft}} generally come equipped with two Rolls-Royce AE 3007 series turbofan engines. The engines have a bypass ratio of 5:1. The engines {{are controlled by}} two <b>FADECs</b> (Full Authority Digital Engine Controls). The <b>FADECs</b> control virtually {{all aspects of the}} engine and send engine data to be displayed on the EICAS for the pilot.|$|R

5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (<b>FADEC).</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, new <b>FADEC</b> (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) {{equipment}} was being integrated onto all RAF Chinooks, as part of an upgrade from the Chinook HC.1 standard to the newer Chinook HC.2 variant. The Ministry of Defence was given a £3 million settlement from Textron, the manufacturers of the system, after a ground-test of the <b>FADEC</b> systems on a Chinook in 1989 resulted in severe airframe damage. Contractors, including Textron, had agreed that <b>FADEC</b> had been the cause of the 1989 incident and that the system needed to be redesigned.|$|E

50|$|In the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules {{which first}} flew in 1996, the T56 is {{replaced}} by the Rolls-Royce AE 2100, which uses dual <b>FADECs</b> (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) to control the engines and propellers. It drives new six-bladed scimitar propellers from Dowty Rotol.|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce AE 2100 is a {{turboprop}} {{developed by}} Allison Engine Company, {{now part of}} Rolls-Royce North America. A derivative of the Allison AE 1107C-Liberty (Rolls-Royce T406) turboshaft engine, the AE 2100 shares the same high-pressure core as that engine, as does the Rolls-Royce AE 3007 turbofan. The engine is a two-shaft design, {{and was the first}} to use dual <b>FADECs</b> (full authority digital engine control) to control both engine and propeller. There are four variants of the engine: the civil AE2100A, and the military variants which include the AE 2100D2/D2A, AE 2100D3, AE 2100J and AE 2100P.|$|R

50|$|Whereas {{most members}} of the Trent family are {{controlled}} by Goodrich <b>FADECs,</b> engine controllers on the Trent 900 are provided by Hamilton Sundstrand, a United Technologies (UTC) company. UTC is also the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, who, with GE Aircraft Engines, is partnering to produce the Engine Alliance GP7000, the other engine available for the A380. This kind of cooperation among competitors is prevalent in the aircraft market as it provides for risk sharing among them and diversity in source countries, which may be a significant factor in an airline's choice of airframe and powerplant.|$|R
50|$|For airliners, flight-control {{redundancy}} improves their safety, but fly-by-wire control systems, {{which are}} physically lighter and have lower maintenance demands than conventional controls also improve economy, {{both in terms}} of cost of ownership and for in-flight economy. In certain designs with limited relaxed stability in the pitch axis, for example the Boeing 777, the flight control system may allow the aircraft to fly at a more aerodynamically efficient angle of attack than a conventionally stable design. Modern airliners also commonly feature computerized Full-Authority Digital Engine Control systems <b>FADECs</b> that control their jet engines, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in a similar fashion to the way that FBW controls the flight control surfaces. This allows the engine output to be continually varied for the most efficient usage possible.|$|R
2500|$|Senior Airbus executive, Fabrice Bregier, said on 30 May 2015 {{that there}} was [...] "either a {{weakness}} in the test procedure of planes before they fly, or a problem that results from the implementation of these procedures." [...] On 3 June 2015 Airbus announced that investigators had confirmed [...] "that engines one, two and three experienced power frozen after lift-off and {{did not respond to}} the crew's attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Preliminary analyses have shown that all other aircraft systems performed normally and did not identify any other abnormalities throughout the flight." [...] The key scenario being examined by investigators is that the torque calibration parameter data was accidentally wiped on three engines as the engine software was being installed at Airbus facilities, which would prevent the <b>FADECs</b> from operating. Under the A400M's design, the first warning pilots would receive of the engine data problem would be when the plane was 120 meters (400 feet) in the air; on the ground, there is no cockpit alert.|$|R

25|$|The EC225 {{is based}} on the Eurocopter AS332L2 Super Puma, {{improving}} upon the design with a five-blade main rotor incorporating a new airfoil shape to reduce vibration and noise levels. The blades of the rotors feature a composite spar and parabolic blade tips; they can also be equipped with an anti-icing system to enable the aircraft to operate within very cold climates. The helicopter is powered by two Turbomeca Makila 2A1 turboshaft engines mounted over the cabin; these engines are capable of providing 14 per cent more engine power and feature a redundant dual-channel full authority digital engine control (<b>FADEC)</b> system for high reliability, a further backup system is present in the event of both <b>FADEC</b> systems failing. The <b>FADEC</b> system ensures that engine power is always kept within the limits of the gearbox. Many of the mechanical components, particularly of the engines, were designed to be modular to ease maintenance, and composite materials were used where possible to reduce the aircraft's weight.|$|E
25|$|The Bell 427 {{is powered}} by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW207D {{turboshaft}} engines with <b>FADEC.</b> Like the Bell 407, the 427 uses a four-blade main rotor system with a rigid, composite rotor hub and a two-blade tail rotor.|$|E
25|$|The -535E4 was {{the first}} engine to {{incorporate}} a hollow wide-chord unsnubbered fan to improve efficiency. It also used more advanced materials, including titanium in the HP compressor and carbon composites in the nacelle.

25|$|The OH-1 {{is powered}} by a pair of Mitsubishi TS1 {{turboshaft}} engines, equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (<b>FADEC),</b> which drives a four-blade composite main rotor with a bearingless rotor hub along with a Fenestron-type anti-torque tail rotor (an enclosed tail-fan unit). The Fenestron uses eight asymmetrically-spaced blades to reduce both noise and vibration.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{a new low}} end version, the FJ44-1AP, was introduced, with a 1965lbf (8.74kN) takeoff thrust, 5% better {{specific}} fuel consumption, {{and lower}} internal temperatures. The -1AP {{is similar to the}} -1A, except for a higher pressure ratio fan, a new combustor and LP turbine, a new full length bypass duct/exhaust mixer and a dual channel <b>FADEC.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Lynx is an agile helicopter, {{capable of}} {{performing}} loops and rolls, and of attaining high speeds. The agility {{of the type}} led to its use as an aerial display aircraft, having been operated with by the Blue Eagles and Black Cats helicopter display teams. The efficiency of the main rotor, {{as well as the}} overall top speed of the Lynx, was substantially improved with the adoption of BERP rotor blade technology. During the 1990s, the hot-and-high performance of the type was considerably boosted in the later Super Lynx 200 series, at which point the type's Gem engines were replaced with the newer LHTEC T800 turboshaft engine with associated <b>FADEC</b> system; the Lynx can also maintain a good level of performance under moderate icing conditions. The <b>FADEC</b> controls eliminated the requirement for a throttle or manual speed selection switches, further simplifying flight control. Later aircraft feature automatic stabilisation equipment; functions such as auto-hover are optionally installed on some Lynx.|$|E
25|$|The S-76C+ was {{produced}} until December 2005. It {{is equipped with}} twin Turbomeca Arriel 2S1 engines with <b>FADEC</b> and a Honeywell EFIS suite. The aircraft incorporates active noise suppression, vibration dampers and a composite main rotor. On January 3, 2006, the S-76 C++ replaced earlier models in production. It is powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 2S2 engines and incorporates an improved and quieter transmission as well as minor changes in the interior equipment and avionics. There were 92 orders for this model as of January 2006.|$|E
25|$|New engines {{offered on}} the 747-400 {{included}} the Pratt & Whitney PW4056, the General Electric CF6-80C2B1F, and the Rolls-Royce RB211-524G/H. The engines offered lower fuel consumption and greater thrust, {{along with a}} full-authority digital engine control (<b>FADEC)</b> which adjusted engine performance for improved efficiency compared with the Classic 747s. A new auxiliary power unit (APU) manufactured by Pratt & Whitney Canada was also selected to provide on-ground power for the 747-400, with a 40 percent reduction in fuel consumption compared to previous APU designs.|$|E
25|$|Pre-{{production}} T-50 {{and initial}} production batches of the Su-57 will use interim engines, {{a pair of}} NPO Saturn izdeliye 117, or AL-41F1. Closely related to the Saturn 117S engine used by the Su-35S, the 117 engine is a highly improved and uprated variant of the AL-31 that powers the Su-27 family of aircraft. The 117 engine produces 93.1kN (21,000lbf) of dry thrust, 147.1kN (33,067lbf) of thrust in afterburner, and has a thrust to weight ratio of 10.5:1. The engines have full authority digital engine control (<b>FADEC)</b> and are integrated into the flight control system to facilitate maneuverability and handling.|$|E
25|$|The AW139 {{is powered}} by two FADEC-controlled Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C {{turboshaft}} engines; the <b>FADEC</b> system seamlessly adjusts the engines for pilot convenience and passenger comfort, and can automatically handle a single-engine failure without noticeable deviation. It was constructed with maintenance requirements in mind; critical systems can be readily accessed, where possible the number of parts has been reduced, and many components have been designed for an extended lifecycle; a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) is also equipped. In excess of a thousand customizable items of equipment can be configured per customer demand, including auxiliary fuel tanks, rescue hoists, cargo hooks, search and weather radar, ice protection systems, external cameras and search lights, and seating arrangements.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the EC135 Active Control Technology demonstrator/Flying Helicopter Simulator (ACT/FHS), a {{research}} aircraft designed to test fibre optic-based flight control systems, undertook its first flight. In 2014, Airbus Helicopters began flying the Bluecopter Demonstrator aircraft, built to explore more efficient design elements, including economy-optimised single-engine operations, Blue Edge swept rotor blades to reduce noise and increase efficiency, a relocated horizontal stabilizer outside the main rotor's downwash, an active rudder, and new water-based external paint; these changes {{were aimed at}} cutting fuel consumption by 40%. In December 2014, {{it was revealed that}} the single-engine operations portion of the Bluecopter tests had been delayed to summer 2016 to make necessary avionics changes, such as to the engine's <b>FADEC</b> systems.|$|E
