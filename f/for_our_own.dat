25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> wingers or for our full-backs.

25|$|Numerous biases in the {{attribution}} process have been discovered. For instance, the fundamental attribution error is {{the tendency to}} make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations. The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people. Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality. Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release.
