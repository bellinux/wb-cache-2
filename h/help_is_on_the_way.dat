Snow continued to fall for three days, and the company {{came to a halt}} as many emigrants died. For nine days the company remained there, while 56 persons died from cold or disease. Finally, on October 28, an advance team of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them. The rescuers encouraged them that <b>help</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way and urged the company to start moving on.|$|R

However, since then, Masʻūd had allied himself with the powerful governor of Azerbaijan and Jibal, who in 1185 began moving his troops across the Zagros Mountains, causing Saladin to hesitate in his attacks. The defenders of Mosul, when they became aware that <b>help</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way, increased their efforts, and Saladin subsequently fell ill, so in March 1186 a peace treaty was signed.|$|R

I cannot conceal that a very bad spirit prevails. Disorders and the most revolting excesses mark every stage of our retreat." [...] Joseph immediately withdrew toward Madrid.

25|$|The 36,850-man Coalition army of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick {{successfully}} {{concluded the}} Siege of Mainz on 23 July 1793. The French garrison of 18,675 men surrendered and <b>was</b> released <b>on</b> <b>the</b> promise of not fighting the Coalition for one year. The French government immediately sent the released troops {{to fight in}} the internal War in the Vendée. During the siege, the French suffered approximately 4,000 casualties while the Coalition lost about 3,000. The 60,000-strong Army of the Rhine under Alexandre de Beauharnais and the 40,000-strong Army of the Moselle under Jean Nicolas Houchard were poised to march to the relief of Mainz. However, Beauharnais had not informed the Mainz garrison that <b>help</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way and then took too long to start his movement. After the fall of Mainz, both French armies retreated, the Army of the Rhine to Wissembourg and the Army of the Moselle to the Saar River. Blamed for the loss of Mainz, Beauharnais fell into a funk, begged to be relieved of command and on 23 August 1793 he was replaced by Charles-Hyacinthe Le Clerc de Landremont. Meanwhile, Houchard had been replaced by Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg on 5 August. Beauharnais was executed by guillotine on 23 July 1794. His widow Joséphine de Beauharnais later married Napoleon Bonaparte.|$|R
25|$|But <b>help</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way. Receiving {{news of the}} Spanish invasion, Édouard Milhaud marched his cavalry to Baza. He {{reaching}} {{there early}} on 4 November 1810 and united his horsemen with Rey's 2,000 French infantry. Milhaud brought 1,300 cavalrymen, including the 5th, 12th, 16th, 20th, and 21st Dragoon Regiments and the Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula. The French also had two horse artillery batteries. Blake had 12 guns {{in addition to the}} 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Army of the Center. Arranging his troopers {{on both sides of the}} main highway, Milhaud ordered a cavalry charge. The French horsemen plowed into Blake's horsemen and scattered them. As the Spanish cavalry fled, they rode through their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers galloped toward the disordered Spanish infantry, the men took to their heels. The Imperial French horsemen completely smashed Blake's vanguard, hacking down scores of soldiers and capturing hundreds of others. When the French came upon Blake's second division deployed in difficult terrain, they stopped their charge. Blake quickly ordered a retreat. In the Battle of Baza the French lost 200 killed and wounded. The cavalry won the battle and Rey's infantry suffered negligible losses. Blake's army lost 500 killed and wounded and 1,000 soldiers captured.|$|R

40|$|Owing to many {{developments}} {{and changes in}} home care in the Netherlands, a national study was carried out. One of the aims {{was to examine the}} differences between the six categories of home help in the Netherlands regarding workload, pressure of work and capacity for coping. A total of 474 home helps from six categories participated in the study. A structured questionnaire, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> components of the research model, was used, which consisted of existing scales regarding workload (organizational and job characteristics, working conditions), psychological and physical outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout, health) and capacity for coping (social support, leadership style, coping strategies). Workload, specifically organizational and job characteristics are scored low by alpha helps and, to a lesser degree, by A home helps. The higher categories of home helps experienced relatively bad working conditions. Home helps, except for alpha <b>helps,</b> <b>are,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole, quite satisfied with their work, {{which is one of the}} psychological and physical outcomes. The higher categories of home help (C, D and E carers) experienced high feelings of emotional exhaustion. Health, absenteeism and back problems did not differ significantly amongst home helps. When looking at capacity for coping, traditional home helps (A to E) received more social support. The subordinate categories of home help dealt less actively with their problems and sought less social support than the other categories. Alpha <b>helps</b> <b>are</b> not employed by the organization and this might cause low organizational and job characteristics, and little social support. Their satisfaction scores suggest that they would like to see their low organizational involvement changed. The higher categories of home help, who carry out many psychosocial tasks, have higher emotional and mental workload and high burout cores. B, C and D carers, who perform personal care and have to adhere to strict planning, experience exrtreme time pressure and a high physical workload. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
