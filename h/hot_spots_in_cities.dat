40|$|Identifying <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> {{of moving}} {{vehicles}} {{in an urban}} area is essential to many smart city applications. The practical research on <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> smart <b>city</b> presents many unique features, such as highly mobile environments, supremely limited size of sample objects, and the non-uniform, biased samples. All these features have raised new challenges that make the traditional density-based clustering algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of objects, making the results less meaningful. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel, non-density-based approach called mobility-based clustering. The key idea is that sample objects are employed as "sensors" to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility, rather than the "object representatives". As such the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated. Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate these effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of mobility-based clustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental results show that using 0. 3 % of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based clustering can accurately identify <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> which can hardly be obtained by the latest representative algorithm UMicro. © 2010 ACM...|$|R

Crowdedness spot is a crowded area {{with a number of}} irregular objects. The practical investigation on <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> smart <b>city</b> offerings many unique features, such as highly mobile environments, the non-uniform biased samples, and supremely limited size of sample objects. The traditional density-based clustering algorithms flop to capture the actual clustering property of objects, making the outputs meaningless.

The basic idea is that sample objects are hired as “sensors ” to recognize the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility, rather than the “object representatives”. As such the mobility of samples is certainly incorporated. Several important factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to remunerate these effects are proposed. Furthermore, taking the identified crowdedness spots as a label of the taxi, we can identify one individual taxi to be a crowdedness taxi that crosses a number of different crowdedness spots.

Besides the destruction of mills, houses and the high number of admissions due to poisoning by smoke, the proportions of the disaster prompted the municipal government decreed a state of emergency and the need to assess the magnitude of the problem. It was in this latter approach that this study aimed to analyze the behavior of the available data by the detection system of Deforestation (DETER / INPE), <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> (BDQueimadas / INPE) and, additionally, apply techniques of image classification sensor ResourceSat- 1 /Liss- 3 to diagnose what was in the municipality for the purpose of evaluating the potential of these images to monitor deforestation and forest fires in areas covered by the Amazon forest. Therefore, we analyzed the data of monthly alerts DETER, accrued monthly and daily data of hotspots and classification of scenes from the sensor 3 -Liss, for the months April to August 2010, all of these resources provided by the National Research Institute Space. As a result, data analysis DETER ratified the increase in alerts and deforestation <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> the <b>city</b> during July and August and the classified images constituted an important complementary tool to the systems used.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} flood-prone locations, flood vulnerability and analyzing {{risk for the}} Municipality of Rotterdam. Municipal call center data of flooding complaints from 2012 - 2016 are investigated to identify the most flood-prone locations, which are called <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> This is performed by creating heat maps of the flooding record locations. The most dominant <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> for multiple analyses are all situated in the sub districts of ‘Rotterdam Centrum’, ‘Delfshaven’ and ‘Noord’. Most flooding records are related to gully pots (≈ 55 %), followed by sewer related problems (≈ 20 %). Flood vulnerability is investigated by analyzing the influence of amount of inhabitants and degree of imperviousness on the <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> locations. Both factors {{are involved in the}} origin of the <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Investigating the influence of rainfall on flooding incidents pointed out an exponential relationship. From comparing differences in resulting flooding records for heavy/extreme rainfall events and cloudbursts, it can be concluded that Rotterdam’s drainage system is better capable at handling short heavy bursts of rainfall than consecutive hours of rainfall. The influence of seasonality on flooding incidents has also been investigated. There do appear to be seasonal patterns, which can be linked to blockages of gully pots by leave fall. In the risk & asset management analysis, asset maps related to infrastructure are created. They are used to calculate risk levels, based on the company values matrix of the Water Management department of Municipality of Rotterdam. The lower elevation of Rotterdam’s city center and surrounding downward slopes, which have been identified from the created elevation map, might contribute to the increased flood vulnerability and <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> the <b>city</b> center area.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the process of enriching the Hamburg 3 D City model (3 D-Stadtmodell) with energy relevant attributes for the simulation of heat demand. The 3 D data of the city provided by the Landesbetrieb Geoinformation und Vermessung (LGV) {{is a combination of}} Cadastre footprints and LiDAR data. This combination of data allows the LGV to produce CityGML data with a level of detail 1 (LOD 1). We use this data as basis for the computation of urban heat demand. This paper presents the enrichment process of the CityGML data. We make use of the energy application domain extension (ADE) to store the energy relevant data in a standardized format. For the enrichment process we classify the residential building stock into building types. And classify the non residential sector by use. From the building types we extract heat transmission coefficients of building components. With the enriched 3 D city model we perform a monthly heat demand estimation of a selected neighbourhood in Hamburg. The aim of this enrichment process is to create a robust but flexible method for the estimation of heat demand at a neighbourhood level with little energy relevant information. This paper presents a method for a quick estimation of the monthly heat demand of a neighbourhood without the need of any extra data input. This approach can be used by the energy and urban planning community for a first estimation of the heat demand used on a given neighbourhood or the entire city. The results from this approach present an urban heat demand model for the city of Hamburg based on the freely available 3 D city model data. Possible uses of this approach are: (1) identification of <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> the <b>city,</b> (2) creation of base data sets for the simulation of retrofit scenarios, and (3) creation of temporal heat density maps...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Hot</b> <b>spots</b> {{policing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} influential police innovations, with a strong body of experimental research showing it to be effective in reducing crime and disorder. However, most studies have been conducted <b>in</b> major <b>cities,</b> and we thus know little about whether it is effective <b>in</b> smaller <b>cities,</b> which account for a majority of police agencies. The lack of experimental studies <b>in</b> smaller <b>cities</b> is likely <b>in</b> part due to challenges designing statistically powerful tests in such contexts. Objectives: The current article explores the challenges of statistical power and “noise” resulting from low base rates of crime <b>in</b> smaller <b>cities</b> and provides suggestions for future evaluations to overcome these limitations. Research Design: Data from a randomized experimental evaluation of broken windows policing <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are used to illustrate the challenges that low base rates present for evaluating <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> policing programs <b>in</b> smaller <b>cities.</b> Results: Analyses show low base rates make it difficult to detect treatment effects. Very large effect sizes would be required to reach sufficient power, and random fluctuations around low base rates make detecting treatment effects difficult, irrespective of power, by masking differences between treatment and control groups. Conclusions: Low base rates present strong challenges to researchers attempting to evaluate <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> policing <b>in</b> smaller <b>cities.</b> As such, base rates must be taken directly into account when designing experimental evaluations. The article offers suggestions for researchers attempting to expand the examination of <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> policing and other microplace-based interventions to smaller jurisdictions.

These <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> roughly overlap with the traditional territories of ethnic minorities. The <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> Ningxia, {{which used to be}} a secondary <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> <b>in</b> 1953, is closely related to the establishment of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in 1957, after which many Hui people from the countryside returned and lived in this favorable social and cultural environment. The formation of the Liaohe River hotspot {{can be attributed to the}} post-reform development of downstream Liaohe River Plain and large cities including Shenyang, which, with a large demand for labor, attracted a floating population of many ethnic minorities from the surrounding areas. With economic and social development, a number of minority population hotspots have risen, noticeably <b>in</b> some large <b>cities.</b> <b>In</b> 2000, Beijing evolved into a <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> from a secondary hotspot in 1953 while Shanghai and Shenzhen became secondary hotspots. They stood out among <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> 2010 with the increasing concentration of ethnic minority floating populations. Apart from the above-mentioned hotspots, ethnic minorities are randomly distributed in most regions and form sporadic cold <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> East, South and Southwest China where the Han people traditionally live, as well as the northwest inland areas (mainly depopulated land). There are no significant cold spots, implying the wide distribution of minority population. It is predictable that the cold spots will decrease owing to increasing mobility of ethnic minorities with further economic and social development.|$|R

In addition, we detected the radio jet of 3 C 303 in the near infrared. Four other <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> those <b>in</b> 3 C 20 East, 3 C 65 (both sides), and 3 C 123 East were not detected in the infrared. The optical candidates for the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> A and B in the western lobe of Cygnus A (3 C 405) were visible in the infrared but their optical-infrared spectra reveal them both to be galactic stars. Neither infrared nor optical candidate was found for <b>hot</b> <b>spot</b> D <b>in</b> the eastern lobe of Cygnus A. We use the detections together with flux measurements at other frequencies to construct synchrotron spectra of the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> from the radio to the optical. Adding the bright <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> Cygnus A, the synchrotron spectra of which are well constrained by our upper limits and the millimetre flux, we are able to extend our general analysis of synchrotron spectra to 8 <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> We confirm our previous claim that first order Fermi acceleration could account for the particle acceleration <b>in</b> most <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> but also provide evidence for our suspicion that the full range of physical parameters is much broader then our original sample indicated.
