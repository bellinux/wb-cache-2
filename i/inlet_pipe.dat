5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
500|$|The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings in}} a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with the fuselage being {{made of a}} framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage, with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels {{as far back as}} the rear of the cockpit. There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber. The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico. A fireproof bulkhead separated the [...] fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel pump, <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and carburetor. The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with teardrop-shaped spats covering the wheels. Initially the tailskid was fixed, but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder. Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{decide to}} investigate. They {{go to the}} old quarry where they meet Chief Wiggum, who comes with them. Marge uses Burly paper towels to drain {{the water from the}} quarry. Then, they find the {{skeleton}} and go into the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to see where the body came from. They find that the pipe leads to a ladder which, in turn, leads to Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier. Declaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his [...] "Memories" [...] box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{deficiencies}} of existing underground heat exchangers, a new design is proposed {{which consists of}} one outlet and three <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes.</b> Experimental measurements to evaluate the performance of single-U, double-U, and the new design referred to as 3 I, for three <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes,</b> were carried out which showed superior performance of the 3 I design. Experimental results showed that when under a constant heating load, the average circulating water temperature (ACWT) of the 3 I-type was 3. 7 and 1 °C {{lower than that of}} single-U and double-U, respectively. The thermal resistance of the 3 I-type was 15. 8 and 31. 1 % lower than that of double-U and single-U type. In addition, numerical simulations were performed to further investigate the heat transfer performance over a very long operating time. Numerical results showed that for long-term operation under constant heating load, the ACWT of the 3 I-type was 6. 6 and 5. 8 % lower than that of double-U type. Under a constant inlet water temperature that mimics a condenser output, the heat exchange per unit borehole depth of 3 I-type was 17. 1 and 11. 6 % higher than that of double-U type in different operation conditions...|$|R

50|$|A {{simplified}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{is shown in}} Figure 2. Initially, the waste valve 4 is open, and the delivery valve 5 is closed. The water in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 1 starts to flow under {{the force of gravity}} and picks up speed and kinetic energy until the increasing drag force closes the waste valve. The momentum of the water flow in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the delivery valve 5, and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|E

This paper pretends to bring attention to the many problems that arise, specially in developing countries, by the fact that no consideration is given in the design stage to the damaging effect that solids (eroded material, solid wastes) may produce in the hydraulic behaviour of the systems by clogging or sediment deposition in curb <b>inlets,</b> <b>pipes,</b> canals, etc...|$|R
40|$|Cassava {{peel and}} cow dung have {{constituted}} {{to global warming}} worldwide because it constitutes heaps of agro-wastes that contributes immensely to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Their contributions to environmental hazards are enormous due to high production of methane gas while degrading. A methane gas {{can be used for}} domestic and industrial application if produced and refined in a biogas reactor. A biogas reactor of capacity 0. 29 m 3 was designed and constructed to produce biogas (methane) using dried cassava peel and cow dung biomass as substrate. The simplicity of the design aids easy loading and unloading, air tightness and operated at mesophilic temperature of 32 °C and pH of 6. 80. The machine consists of agitator for mixing the biomass to prevent the formation of scum, <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes,</b> valves, gas outlet, and stand, crank and pressure gauge. All components were made of galvanized steel except valves outlet and <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes</b> which was made of galvanized aluminum pipe. The criteria considered {{in the design of the}} biogas reactor included air tightness of the whole unit, mesophilic temperature, pH, nature of substrate, and substrate retention period. The biogas reactor was tested with 24 kg of dried cassava peel co-mixed with 48 kg of pasty cow dung in ratio 1 : 2. Daily gas yield was determined; gas pressure in the biogas reactor was measured by pressure gauge, while the ambient temperature was measured using hand held mercury-in-glass thermometer. Results show that biogas was produced after 24 days retention period at average substrate temperature and pH of 32 °C and 6. 80 respectively. The reactor was designed to accommodate 0. 145 m 3 of substrate equivalent to half of the reactor volume.

50|$|It is very {{important}} that jet fuel be free from water contamination. During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops {{to the bottom of the}} tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 °C. If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes.</b> This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing.|$|R
30|$|Finally, a 1 -D {{transport}} model was created and implemented. It considers advection/reaction along pipes, imperfect mixing for Double T-junctions, and perfect mixing for simple junction nodes. For imperfect mixing the mean cross-sectional concentration {{at the two}} outlets was calculated. The result depends on the Reynolds number at half distance, on the two inlet and outlet flow rate ratios and on the interpipe length. A lookup table was deduced from the CFD simulations, and the Kriging method was used for points {{that are not in}} the table. In cases of imperfect mixing, the interpipe length is most likely small and therefore the transport inside such pipe is neglected. The concentrations {{at the beginning of the}} outlet pipes depend directly on the flow rates and concentration of the end of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipes</b> based on the 1 -D law defined in this paper.|$|R
