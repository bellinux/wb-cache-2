5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful attempts by the crew to restore proper <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> and engine operation. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN {{is used in}} xerographic {{process and}} laser {{printers}} as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum. In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting <b>fuel</b> <b>flow.</b> The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.|$|E
5|$|While {{these six}} {{aircraft}} provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters, the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate, {{and were not}} suitable for refuelling bombers. Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rate as the wing reels, and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively.|$|E
50|$|Check valves are {{fitted in}} the filler {{and on the}} fill input to the fuel tank to prevent <b>fuel</b> <b>flowing</b> back the wrong way.|$|R
5000|$|Auto-rich position, {{where the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> through the rich, {{enrichment}} and lean fuel metering jets. This position {{is used for}} take off and landing.|$|R
5000|$|Auto-Lean position, where <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> {{through the}} {{enrichment}} and lean fuel metering jets. This {{is sometimes called}} the cruise position, as this is the most-used position while in-flight.|$|R
5|$|Engine number 4 {{suffered}} only minor, external damage. It was dismantled by {{the investigation}} team {{in an attempt}} to determine why it might have been shut down by the crew. A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> meter on engine number 4. Western Australia's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as magnesium hydroxide. This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water, suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with water in the months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine. Charles Gibbs, an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation, estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved. Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not account for this much water in the fuel passages. Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident. He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left water in the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed. This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by water in the fuel reaching engine number 4. The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion. Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground, and the crew's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller, may have been related to water in the fuel reaching that engine. Similarly, the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water.|$|E
25|$|A higher {{bypass ratio}} {{increases}} the thrust {{for the same}} engine power as a fundamental consequence of transferring power from a small diameter propelling jet to a larger diameter one. When the F-135 is in the hover using its increased bypass ratio, the thrust augmentation decreases to 50% with no increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>flow.</b> Thrust augmentation increases to 52% in horizontal flight when using the afterburner, but with a large increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Combustors play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} many of an engine's operating characteristics, such as fuel efficiency, levels of emissions and transient response (the response to changing conditions such a <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> and air speed).|$|E
5000|$|War Emergency {{position}} (military carburetors only), where <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> {{through the}} lean and rich fuel metering jets only, {{but only when}} there is pressure in the Anti-detonation injection (ADI) system.|$|R
50|$|Spill phase: The {{pump element}} {{is on the}} way down, and as long as solenoid valve remains {{de-energized}} the fuel line is open and <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> in through into the return duct.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>flowing</b> {{into the}} engine {{is used as a}} coolant to cool the engine, {{hydraulic}} fluid, oil, TEB tank, afterburner nozzle actuator control lines, air conditioning systems, and the parts of the airframe subjected to aerodynamic heating.|$|R
25|$|One {{aircraft}} was entered {{on the civil}} register as G-EBON and was flown in the 1919 King's Cup Air Race, the Plover retired from the race due to <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> problems. G-EBON crashed and was destroyed in January 1929.|$|E
25|$|To promote fuel {{efficiency}} and limit horsepower levels {{seen in the}} 1980s, the last time Formula One used forced induction engines, <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> was restricted to 100kg/h above 10,500 rpm; below 10,500 rpm a formula for the maximum flow was applied based on the rpm in use.|$|E
25|$|A {{welding torch}} head {{is used to}} weld metals. It can be {{identified}} by having {{only one or two}} pipes running to the nozzle, no oxygen-blast trigger, and two valve knobs {{at the bottom of the}} handle letting the operator adjust the oxygen and <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Expander cycle rocket engines {{suffer from}} the square-cube law. Their size, and {{therefore}} thrust, is limited by heat transfer efficiency due to the surface area of the nozzle increasing slower than the volume of <b>fuel</b> <b>flowing</b> through the nozzle.|$|R
50|$|Fuels are {{frequently}} used as coolants for engines. A cold <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> over {{some parts of}} the engine, absorbing its waste heat and being preheated before combustion. Kerosene and other jet fuels frequently serve in this role in aviation engines.|$|R
50|$|Tap-off cycle: Takes {{hot gases}} {{from the main}} {{combustion}} chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted. Since not all <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> through the main combustion chamber, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. Examples include the J-2S and BE-3.|$|R
25|$|The {{discharge}} valve is spring-loaded to a preset pressure discharge pressure, {{acting as a}} variable size restriction to hold a constant pressure in chamber D, despite varying <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The valve is opened as the discharge fuel pressure increases above the force from the spring, thereby lowering the fuel pressure to maintain a balanced position with the spring force.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{chambers}} in the fuel regulator {{portion of the}} carburetor. They are referred to by letters A, B, C, and D, with the A chamber closest to the throttle body. The fuel metering servo valve responds to pressure differentials across the diaphragms separating the chambers. The resulting diaphragm movement controls <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> into the engine under all flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|This {{accumulation}} of ice {{had no effect}} on the flight until the final stages of the approach into Heathrow, when increased <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> and higher temperatures suddenly released it back into the fuel. This formed a slush of soft ice which flowed forward until it reached the Fuel-Oil Heat Exchangers (FOHEs) where it froze once again, causing a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{corresponding}} <b>fuel</b> weight <b>flow</b> rates can be computed now: ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there was}} little danger of an {{accidental}} nuclear explosion, {{the destruction of the}} nuclear warhead on the launch pad caused contamination of the area by alpha-emitting core materials. Burning rocket <b>fuel,</b> <b>flowing</b> through the cable trenches, caused extensive chemical contamination of the trenches and the equipment associated with the cabling in the trenches.|$|R
50|$|In a {{continuous}} injection system, <b>fuel</b> <b>flows</b> {{at all times}} from the fuel injectors, but at a variable flow rate. This {{is in contrast to}} most fuel injection systems, which provide fuel during short pulses of varying duration, with a constant rate of flow during each pulse. Continuous injection systems can be multi-point or single-point, but not direct.|$|R
25|$|The report {{summarised}} {{the extensive}} testing performed {{in an effort}} to replicate the problem suffered by G-YMMM. This included creating a mock-up of G-YMMM's fuel delivery system, to which water was added to study its freezing properties. After a battery of tests, the AAIB had not yet succeeded in reproducing the suspected icing behaviour, and was undertaking further investigation. Nevertheless, the AAIB believed its testing showed that <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> was restricted on G-YMMM and that frozen water in the jet fuel could have caused the restriction, ruling out alternative hypotheses such as a failure of the aircraft's FADEC (computerised engine control system). The hypothesis favoured in the report was that ice had accreted somewhere downstream of the boost pumps in the wing fuel tanks and upstream of the engine-mounted fuel pumps. Either enough ice had accumulated to cause a blockage at a single point, or ice throughout the fuel lines had become dislodged as <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> increased during the landing approach, and the dislodged ice had then formed a blockage somewhere downstream.|$|E
25|$|The basic Mk V was a Mk I {{with the}} Merlin 45 series engine. This engine {{delivered}} 1,440hp (1,074kW) at take-off, and incorporated a new single-speed single-stage supercharger design. Improvements to the carburettor also allowed the Spitfire to use zero gravity manoeuvres without {{any problems with}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flow.</b> Several Mk I and Mk II airframes were converted to Mk V standard by Supermarine and started equipping fighter units from early 1941. The majority of the Mk Vs were built at Castle Bromwich.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{crystals}} in {{the fuel}} were blamed {{as the cause}} of the accident, clogging the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE) of each engine. This restricted <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> to the engines when thrust was demanded during the final approach to Heathrow. Boeing identified the problem as specific to the Rolls-Royce engine fuel-oil heat exchangers, and Rolls-Royce subsequently developed a modification to its FOHE; the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) mandated that all affected aircraft were to be fitted with the modification before 1 January 2011.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem with}} the {{containers}} was the crimped or soldered seams, which easily split during transportation, especially over the rocky desert terrain in North Africa. Containers were stacked {{on top of each}} other during shipping, and the upper layers crushed those below, resulting in <b>fuel</b> <b>flowing</b> freely in the bilges - with the resulting poisoning and fire risks.|$|R

Adjusted, independently of main injected <b>flow</b> of <b>fuel</b> and oxidizer, by selection of nozzle passing larger or smaller flow...|$|R
50|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the finish, USAC official Frank Delroy announced there would be no penalty for Grant pitting in the wrong stall. The initial ruling was that no <b>fuel</b> <b>flowed</b> into the tank. However, the decision would be further investigated during the evening, and a final ruling would be made when official results posted at 8:00 a.m. the next morning.|$|R
25|$|At Le Bourget Airport near Paris, the Aéro-Club de France and the 34th Aviation Regiment of the French Air Force {{were able}} to {{demonstrate}} passing fuel between machines at the annual aviation fete at Vincennes in 1928. The UK's Royal Aircraft Establishment was also running mid-air refueling trials, with the aim to use this technique to extend {{the range of the}} long-distance flying boats that serviced the British Empire. By 1931 they had demonstrated refueling between two Vickers Virginias, with <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> controlled by an automatic valve on the hose which would cut off if contact was lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low <b>fuel</b> <b>flow</b> within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E
25|$|In its Special Bulletin of 18 February 2008, the AAIB noted {{evidence}} that cavitation {{had taken place}} in both high pressure fuel pumps, which could be indicative of a restriction in the fuel supply or excessive aeration of the fuel, although the manufacturer assessed both pumps as still being able to deliver full <b>fuel</b> <b>flow.</b> The report noted the aircraft had flown through air that was unusually cold (but not exceptionally so), and concluded that the temperature had not been low enough to freeze the fuel. Tests were continuing in an attempt to replicate the damage seen in the fuel pumps and to match this to the data recorded on the flight. A comprehensive examination and analysis was to be conducted on the entire aircraft and engine fuel system, including modelling fuel flows, taking account of environmental and aerodynamic effects.|$|E
5000|$|In a jet engine, thrust is {{controlled}} by changing the amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>flowing</b> into the combustion chamber, similar to a diesel engine. Thus, the name [...] "throttle" [...] is a misnomer (more accurately known as a [...] "thrust lever", as in most Airbus and Boeing aircraft). This is chiefly because [...] "throttle" [...] is a legacy of traditional gasoline aircraft engines.|$|R

50|$|The town became {{nationally known}} for a truck {{disaster}} that happened on 7 July 1987. After losing control because of faulty brakes, a tanker truck carrying about 34 000 L of fuel ran into a house containing an ice cream parlour and a pizzeria. The escaping <b>fuel</b> <b>flowed</b> into the sewers and exploded, setting several houses on fire. All together, six people lost their lives, and 40 were injured.|$|R
