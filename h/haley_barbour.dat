5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit from the Republican electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates who had previously run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The early stages of the race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. Perhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run (including Mike Pence, John Thune, <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour,</b> Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour</b> {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair damage incurred from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E

5|$|Outer rainbands began {{affecting}} coastal {{sections of}} the Florida Panhandle by about 12hours prior {{to the formation of}} the depression. Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola, Florida, westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Shortly thereafter, an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River, Walthall, and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana. Additionally, the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana. In Mississippi, Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour</b> {{declared a state of emergency}}. Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes for Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock counties. Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters, citing the potential need of shelter for citizens in about 17,000FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe complexities {{of leadership in}} today’s environment are often obscured by the focus of traditional theories on leadership as the top-down, leader-subordinate construct typical of hierarchical organizations. These theories also do not fully capture what occurs when leaders must catalyze action well above and beyond their formal lines of decision making and control. Leaders today must simultaneously lead down in the traditional sense, up to influence the people or organizations {{to which they are}} accountable, and across to activate peer groups and others with whom there is no formal subordinate relationship, and that these activities are parts of an integrated whole. This leadership model is referred to as meta-leadership. This thesis asked, to what extent is Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour’s</b> response to and decision making during Hurricane Katrina an example of meta-leadership? What can be learned as far as smart practices from Barbour’s leadership and can these practices be replicated? The focus of this thesis was the conduct of a single case study. Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour’s</b> leadership style and decision-making process during Hurricane Katrina response operations were examined to determine whether or to what extent they accord with the theory of meta-leadership. Our conclusions are that Governor Barbour epitomized the tenets of meta-leadership and that, given the proper academic environment, meta-leadership can be replicated...|$|R
50|$|The Kemper Project {{received}} an estimated $270 million in Department of Energy funds after the Southern Company’s {{plan for the}} proposed Orlando Gasification Project bunked when Florida decided the state {{was not interested in}} more coal plants. These transferred funds were moved from Florida to Mississippi in December 2008, after <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour's</b> Washington D.C. lobbying firm, the BGR Group, pushed for the reallocation. Southern Company has been a BGR client since 1999, having spent a total of $2.6 million with the firm, according to federal lobbying disclosure documents. However, Southern Company alleges that Governor Barbour did not help them receive any additional funding at all. The BGR Group website has deleted all connections with Southern Company from its website.|$|R

25|$|In 1987, 20 {{years after}} the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1967's Loving v. Virginia that a similar Virginian law was unconstitutional, Mississippi {{repealed}} its ban on interracial marriage (also known as miscegenation), which had been enacted in 1890. It also repealed the segregationist-era poll tax in 1989. In 1995, the state symbolically ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which had abolished slavery in 1865. Though ratified in 1995, the state never officially notified the U.S. archivist, which kept the ratification unofficial until 2013, when Ken Sullivan contacted the office of Secretary of State of Mississippi, Delbert Hosemann, who agreed to file the paperwork and make it official. In 2009, the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory civil rights laws, which had been enacted in 1964, {{the same year as}} the federal Civil Rights Act, but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts. Republican Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour</b> signed the bill into law.|$|E

25|$|Roger Wicker, {{formerly}} {{the representative of}} Mississippi's 1st congressional district, was appointed by Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour</b> on December 31, 2007, to fill the vacancy caused by the December 18 resignation of Trent Lott. It had been speculated that Lott wished to resign before a new lobbying reform law, effective {{the first day of}} 2008, took effect; having resigned before the end of 2007, Lott may become a lobbyist in 2009 instead of 2010. Controversy arose when Barbour called for the special election to be held on the same day as the general election. As a result, Mississippi's Attorney General Jim Hood challenged Barbour in court, claiming that the special election needed to be held within 100 days of Lott's resignation, as per state law. Initially, a Mississippi Circuit Court judge sided with Hood, ruling that the election take place on or before March 19, 2008. However, Barbour filed an appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which overturned the earlier ruling and set the special election for November 4, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Before Hurricane Katrina {{struck the}} Gulf Coast, Mississippi was the second-largest {{gambling}} {{state in the}} Union, after Nevada and ahead of New Jersey. An estimated $500,000 per day in tax revenue was lost following Hurricane Katrina's severe damage to several coastal casinos in Biloxi in August 2005. Because of the destruction from this hurricane, on October 17, 2005, Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour</b> signed a bill into law that allows casinos in Hancock and Harrison counties to rebuild on land (but within [...] of the water). The only exception is in Harrison County, where the new law states that casinos can be built to the southern boundary of U.S. Route 90.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, {{the wording}} {{throughout}} the Republican Party platform was changed from Democratic Party to Democrat Party: Republican leaders [...] "explained {{they wanted to}} make the subtle point that the Democratic Party had become elitist".

A proposal to use the term in the August 2008 Republican platform for similar reasons was voted down, with leaders choosing to use Democratic Party. [...] "We probably should use what the actual name is," [...] said Mississippi Governor <b>Haley</b> <b>Barbour,</b> the panel's chairman. [...] "At least in writing." ...|$|E
