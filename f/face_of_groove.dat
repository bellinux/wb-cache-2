40|$|An {{improved}} {{solar cell}} design is described. A surface of each solar cell has a plurality <b>of</b> <b>grooves.</b> Each groove has a vertical {{face and a}} slanted face that is covered by a reflecting metal. Light rays are reflected from the slanted face through the vertical face where they traverse a photovoltaic junction. As the light rays travel to the slanted <b>face</b> <b>of</b> an adjacent <b>groove,</b> they again traverse the junction. The underside of the reflecting coating directs the light rays toward the opposite surface of solar cell as they traverse the junction again. When the light rays travel through the solar cell and reach the saw toothed grooves on the under side, the process of reflection and repeatedly traversing the junction again takes place. The light rays ultimately emerge from the solar cell. These solar cells are particularly useful at very high levels of insolation because the infrared or heat radiation passes through the cells without being appreciably absorbed to heat the cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{modernization}} of a vacuum grating infrared spectrometer is described. Experiments using this spectrometer on N-methyl formamide in the vapor phase are described, {{and the results}} are interpreted in terms of the position, shape, and intensity change with temperature of the vibration bands of this substance. It is concluded that N-methyl formamide exists in two isomeric forms in the vapor phase. The less abundant form is the cis isomer which lies 1. 4 kcal. above the trans isomer. An echelle-type grating used with this spectrometer is shown to have an unusually wide and flat efficiency curve. This is ascribed to a scattering phenomenon in which both <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> a <b>groove</b> participate. Mathematical analyses based on both the Kirchhoff theory and on the Rayleigh theory are shown to predict the broad region of high efficiency for this grating. An amplifier which is intended to be used with a novel double-beam ratio detection system is described. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigation and numerical modelling {{of the tool}} wear in rough turning of large dimensions components of nuclear power plants made of 18 MND 5 steel. The tool wear has been characterised experimentally at microscopic scale using observations of different zones of the engaged cutting part at the tool rake face. A model has been developed to predict the tool wear as observed on images. The major finding of the paper concerns the prediction of contact discontinuities at the microscopic scale on the tool rake face and where the wear process is highly localized. These discontinuities are attributed to the complex geometry <b>of</b> the rake <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grooved</b> cutting insert, designed especially to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip breakage. The cutting force, specific cutting force and chip morphology parameters are also predicted and compared to experimental trends. This research work is a contribution for the tool wear prediction in rough turning to improve the tool life of complex cutting inserts at high material removal rate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{wear rate}} of {{a cutting tool}} mainly affects its life. So it is {{important}} for tool manufacturers to think about different techniques to reduce tool wear rate, which in turn helps to increase its life span. This paper proposes an efficient design of an array <b>of</b> micro <b>grooves</b> useful for the deposition of alternate hard and soft nanocoatings which will help to characterize and analyze wear zones of WC inserts. The proposed design <b>of</b> the <b>grooves</b> on tool inserts helps to deposit various nanocoatings which act as a lubricating medium and helps the tool to reduce friction and wear. Grooves were designed based on the chip flow path. Electro discharge machining (EDM) was used for the formation <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> on the rake <b>face</b> <b>of</b> WC inserts. The authors made an attempt to design efficient and generalized groove pattern to deposit hard and soft alternative nanocoatings on the rake <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the cutting tool. Authors are also suggested that the method proposed in this paper can concentrate on the identified zones instead of depositing the nanocoatings over the entire rake face. This in turn reduces the wastage of Nanomaterial deposited on the tool and also makes optimum rake face utilization. PVD technique is used to deposit alternate soft and hard nanocoatings in the grooves...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we have {{successfully}} fabricated electrospun polystyrene (PS) nanofibers having {{a diameter of}} 326 [*]±[*] 50  nm with a parallel grooved texture using a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). We discovered that solvent system, solution concentration, and relative humidity were the three key factors to the formation <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> texture and the diameter of nanofibers. We demonstrated that grooved nanofibers with desired properties (e.g., different numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> widths between two adjacent <b>grooves,</b> and depths <b>of</b> <b>grooves)</b> could be electrospun under certain conditions. When THF/DMF ratio was higher than 2 : 1, the formation mechanism <b>of</b> single <b>grooved</b> texture should {{be attributed to the}} formation of voids on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation and solidification of the voids into a line surface structure. When THF/DMF ratio was 1 : 1, the formation mechanism <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> texture should be ascribed to the formation of wrinkled surface on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation into a grooved texture. Such findings can serve as guidelines for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>grooved</b> nanofibers with desired secondary morphology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} {{distribution in}} a flat spiral groove thrust bearing obtained from a straightforward solution of the Reynolds equation includes subatmospheric pressure in part <b>of</b> the <b>grooved</b> area. This is masked in the common theory {{based on the assumption}} of an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>grooves.</b> Furthermore, the negative contribution to the load capacity from this area is usually small, which may explain why the presence of subatmospheric pressure has not been given much attention in connectionwith these bearings. Subatmospheric pressure is, however, necessary for liquid-lubricated flat spiral <b>groove</b> thrust bearings <b>of</b> conventional design to work at all at low numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves,</b> which in turn requires a non-zero cavitation pressure. Cavitation within individual grooves implies non-linearity in, for example, the relation between load capacity and rotational speed of the bearing and limits the obtainable load capacity. This is more pronounced and important to consider at low numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> (wide grooves) than at high numbers <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> (narrow grooves), {{and it is difficult to}} determine for what number <b>of</b> <b>grooves</b> that reliable prediction of bearing performance can be expected. It depends on the actual value of the cavitation pressure and other parameters that are usually unknown or difficult to account for. To avoid this disadvantage a modified design of liquid-lubricated flat spiral groove thrust bearings is suggested...|$|R
