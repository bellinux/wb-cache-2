500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Adam Markovitz panned {{the record}} as an empty gesture and {{asserted}} that the album was rushed, signifying an album with [...] "barely enough zip to keep the <b>kids</b> <b>up</b> past dinner." [...] Likewise, Robert Copsey from Digital Spy wrote, [...] "The result [...] may see them progressing at a snail's pace, but when you've got it so good, what's the rush anyway?" [...] In a mixed review, The New York Times contributor Jon Caramanica appreciated the album's sonic palette, but dismissed its lyricism as narrow and tedious, and Sheeran's contributions as [...] "unusually lumpy {{in the hands of}} such a polished group". Caramanica characterised the members' vocals as [...] "fundamentally interchangeable", and opined that only Zayn Malik [...] "breaks free from the pack vocally with any regularity." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the <b>kids</b> <b>up</b> for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E

His maternal grandmother ran a boarding house in Tombstone and fought to keep the Tucson public schools desegregated. When Whites established separate schools, she relocated to Los Angeles, having decided that [...] "she was not going to bring those <b>kids</b> <b>up</b> in a segregated environment." [...] Rumford remained with his mother in Tucson, where she worked as a housekeeper. His older brother Chauncey moved to Los Angeles to live with his father and paternal grandmother, and Rumford and his mother soon moved to Phoenix, where she married a barber, Elmer J. Williams. They joined {{the rest of the family}} in Los Angeles in 1915, living for a time in a large house on Burlington Avenue. There, his paternal grandmother's sister, who was a songwriter, poet, and painter, helped Delilah L. Beasley write her 1916 history The Negro Trail Blazers of California.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 after The Get <b>Up</b> <b>Kids</b> split <b>up,</b> {{lead singer}} Matt Pryor turned {{his focus on}} his other band The New Amsterdams and, primarily, his children. The main reason The Get <b>Up</b> <b>Kids</b> split <b>up</b> was due to Pryor's disenchantment with touring, and his desire {{to spend more time}} with his children. As he spent more time with them, he began writing children's songs. Eventually, he showed them to his bandmates, and they decided to perform them. Pryor's goal was to create music that would engage children, but {{entertain}} their parents as well. Eventually, they recorded their first album, If You Ever See an Owl.... After the album was complete, however, it was not released immediately due to the band members focusing on The New Amsterdams. Alongside this, they wanted artist and friend Travis Miller to illustrate a storybook to be packaged with the album. Finally, in 2005 the album was released independently, then re-released on Vagrant Records in 2007.|$|R
