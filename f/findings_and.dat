5|$|Christian Renoux, {{a history}} {{professor}} at the University of Orléans, published in French in 2001 a book-length study of the prayer and its origins, clearing up much of the confusion that had accumulated previously. The Franciscan journal Frate Francesco and the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano published articles in Italian summarizing the book's <b>findings,</b> <b>and</b> Renoux published an online abstract in English at The Franciscan Archive.|$|E

5|$|After {{travelling}} to the Himalaya {{the first}} time, the Workmans became entranced with climbing and mountaineering. Over {{a span of}} 14 years, they traveled eight times to the area, {{which at the time}} was almost completely unexplored and unmapped. Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment, freeze-dried foods, sunblock, or radios. On each expedition, they explored, surveyed, and photographed, ultimately reporting on their <b>findings</b> <b>and</b> creating maps. The couple shared and alternated responsibilities; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its <b>findings</b> <b>and</b> with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the {{conservation}} {{status of the}} North Pacific right whale as a distinct species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's <b>findings,</b> <b>and</b> recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude the three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, the Australian {{government}} {{created the}} White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation {{in addition to}} federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities. An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research <b>findings,</b> <b>and</b> to implement further conservation actions. A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need {{for the development of}} regional conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the Congress {{restored}} {{funding for}} fiscal year 2008 {{as part of an}} omnibus appropriations bill which the President later signed. At the same time the Congress directed NASA to move the mission forward to the development phase. In 2009 the project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for the <b>findings</b> <b>and</b> recommendations of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, Astro2010, performed by the National Academy of Sciences, which would determine the project's future.|$|E

The Venturing change will occur in late 2013 or early 2014; the Cub Scout change will take effect in mid-2015.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s two men began to {{assemble}} a very different picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over {{the next four years}} he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his <b>findings</b> <b>and</b> key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{that the}} {{phenomenon}} {{occurring in the}} room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her <b>findings,</b> <b>and</b> forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{site was}} then {{sold by the}} Commissioners to Deddington's parish council. The parish council {{intended}} to build tennis courts in the inner bailey of the castle in 1947 but, when work began, medieval pottery and roof tiles began to be unearthed by the builders. Construction work was halted and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford sponsored an archaeological investigation by Edward Jope and Richard Threlfall that continued until 1953. The plans for the tennis courts were dropped {{in light of the}} <b>findings,</b> <b>and</b> the site was instead used as a park. A further phase of archaeological investigation of the castle was carried out between 1977 and 1979, sponsored by the Queen's University Belfast and led by Richard Ivens.|$|E
