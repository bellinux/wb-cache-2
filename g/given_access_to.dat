5|$|Brood War {{introduces}} seven new units. Each race is <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{a unique}} ground unit: the Zerg {{can create a}} defensive unit that can attack from the concealment of its burrow, while the Terrans can train combat medics. The Protoss are able to produce dark templar units, a powerful cloaked melee unit only given to the player in special missions of StarCraft. Protoss players can merge two of these units to create a special spellcaster unit. Each race is also <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a dedicated air-to-air attack unit.|$|E
5|$|Cruise's casting caused {{controversy}} among German {{politicians and}} members of the von Stauffenberg family due to the actor's practice of Scientology, which is viewed with suspicion in Germany. Because of this, the filmmakers initially had difficulty setting up filming locations in Germany, but they were later <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> film in locations, including Berlin's historic Bendlerblock. German newspapers and filmmakers supported the film and its attempt to spread global awareness of von Stauffenberg's plot.|$|E

5|$|In {{charge of}} these Serbian {{military}} conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević, his right-hand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and the spy Rade Malobabić. Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the same clandestine network of safe-houses and agents that Malobabić {{used for the}} infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their defeat in World War I and the {{resulting}} Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine, Northern Schleswig and Memel. The Saarland temporarily became a protectorate of France under the condition that its residents would later decide by referendum which country to join and Poland became a separate nation and was <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the sea by the creation of the Polish Corridor, which separated Prussia from the rest of Germany, while Danzig was made a free city.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a Robot Master. When a Robot Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E

5|$|In The Final Fantasy Legend, {{the player}} navigates a {{character}} throughout the game {{world with a}} party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas. To aid exploration on the field screen, the game makes use of various signs within towns. The player is initially limited to the World of Continent to explore, and <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> later worlds as his or her party climbs the Tower. Players can save their game anytime and anywhere when not in combat to a save slot for later play.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days without access to lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the interviewee.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for the picture. <b>Given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> an individual account or fund (peculium) {{that he could}} use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} alternates {{between two}} types of sections: Escape sections, where the player completes puzzles in escape-the-room scenarios; and Novel sections, where the player reads the game's narrative through visual novel segments, and makes decisions that influence the story toward one of twenty-four different endings. The player is <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a flowchart, which allows them to revisit any previously completed section, and choose a different option to cause the story to proceed in another direction.|$|E

5|$|Their {{next stop}} is Agate Village, a forested {{village in the}} mountains. As Rui {{introduces}} Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun {{to the center of}} the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Relic Stone, the only place where he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the full report.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer graphics card {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent acceptance testing in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold in the female edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing cracks in the motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout the repairs users were <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that the repairs were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory had a {{governing}} board, {{the members of}} which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, George Kistiakowsky and Kenneth Bainbridge were later added. The laboratory was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be <b>given</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a junior scientist or technician.|$|E
