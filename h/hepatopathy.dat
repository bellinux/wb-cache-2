5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive <b>hepatopathy.</b> Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the effects of the 2007 regulatory measures concerning nimesulide and to estimate the potential effect of further actions. Specifically, we carried out a simulation on the expected number of hospitalisations for <b>hepatopathies</b> and upper gastrointestinal bleedings (UGIBs) in Italy before and after the regulatory measures (2006 vs. 2009), taking into account the shifting of nimesulide prescriptions on other non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The expected figures of hospitalisation for <b>hepatopathies</b> and UGIBs for all NSAIDs were calculated on the basis of risk estimates reported in two epidemiological studies. The result of the simulation suggests that the implementation of the restrictive actions might prevent 79 events of liver injuries, but might increase UGIBs by 859 events. The simulation helped to clarify the effects on <b>hepatopathies</b> and UGIBs as a consequence of nimesulide restriction of use. Analogous simulations might be conducted when assuming regulatory actions...|$|R

Objective: to establish the diagnosis of hemochromatosis type 1 in Cuba, and calculate its frequencies in patients with <b>hepatopathies.</b> Methods: an analytic cross-sectional study was conducted including 65 patients with liver disease, who were referred to the laboratory of Molecular Biology of the National Medical Genetics Center by clinical geneticists. A PCR-RFLP analysis was used for detecting the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations in the HFE gene. Results: PCR-RFLP analysis was standardized for the detection of C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and describe macrospcopic and microscopic liver lesions in pigs necropsied at the forensic discipline during 2 years of study; assessing the <b>hepatopathies</b> prevalence, based on morphopathological criteria (circulatory disorders, dystrophic processes, inflammatory and tumor processes). The study was conducted in the period November 2012 - 90 October 2014. It involved necropsies of 90 swine corpses, aged 3 weeks - 6 months, from intensive swine breeding systems, to elucidate the cause of death. After necropsy and thorough macroscopic examination of the liver and gall bladder samples were taken to carry out microscopic examination. Of the total of 90 necropsied pigs, 65 cases were diagnosed macroscopically and microscopically with <b>hepatopathies</b> (72. 2 %). In the pigs necropsied during the study the following were diagnosed, in decreasing order: dystrophic liver diseases (51. 1 %), inflammatory liver diseases (17. 7 %), circulatory liver diseases (2. 2 %) and liver necrosis (2. 2 %). The most numerous dystrophic liver diseases were lipidic hepatosis followed by protidic hepatosis and pigmentation hepatosis. The inflammatory liver diseases were represented by the parenchymal hepatitis or acute toxic hepatitis, and fibrous purulent hepatitis. Inflammatory liver diseases, histologically affect all structures: hepatocytes, blood vessels, bile ducts and the fundamental substance- predominantly collagen.

The paler areas are unaffected surrounding liver tissue. When severe and longstanding, hepatic congestion can lead to fibrosis; if congestion is due to right heart failure, it is called cardiac cirrhosis.|$|E
50|$|Backward {{failure of}} the right {{ventricle}} leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body.

Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive <b>hepatopathy),</b> and jaundice and even coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur.|$|E

50|$|Phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) {{deficiency}} is {{an inherited}} metabolic disorder in humans. Affected patients show multiple disease phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance, and <b>hepatopathy,</b> reflecting {{the central role}} of the enzyme in glucose metabolism. The biochemical phenotypes of the PGM1 mutants cluster into two groups: those with compromised catalysis and those with possible folding defects. Relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, certain missense mutants show greatly decreased expression of soluble protein and/or increased aggregation. In contrast, other missense variants are well behaved in solution, but show dramatic reductions in enzyme activity, with Kcat/Km often <1.5% of wild-type. Modest changes in protein conformation and flexibility are also apparent in some of the catalytically impaired variants. In the case of the G291R mutant, severely compromised activity is linked to the inability of a key active site serine to be phosphorylated, a prerequisite for catalysis. Our results complement previous in vivo studies, which suggest that both protein misfolding and catalytic impairment {{may play a role in}} PGM1 deficiency.|$|E

There are a limited number of studies in the pediatric population on malarial <b>hepatopathy.</b> Objective To assess the factors associated with malarial <b>hepatopathy,</b> the varied clinical presentations, as well as its complications. Methods This prospective study was conducted in the Department of Paediatrics, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Post Graduate Institute of Paediatrics (SVPPGIP), Cuttack, Odisha, India from January 20 10 to June 2013, and included 70 children with malaria and jaundice, aged 6 months to 14 years.

Every three months, the serum levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, cholesterol, triglyceride and glycemia are assessed over a two year follow-up. The serum thyroid hormone levels as well as the presence of auto-antibodies were also measured. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in all patients with persistently elevated ALT or AST levels. A needle biopsy of liver was performed in 9 donors without definite diagnostic after medical investigation. The presence of anti-HCV antibodies in 116 donors were assayed again the first clinical evaluation. At the end of follow-up period (2 years later) 71 donors were tested again for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies.

One patient died after operation from the precipitating condition, and two MCS grafts that thrombosed were restored. All 21 surviving patients remain well, free from ascites, and all shunts are patent after a mean follow-up of 5. 6 +/- 1 years, five {{patients with}} more than 10 years' follow-up. This long-term survival achieved by portasystemic shunts suggests {{that they have a}} major role in the treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The authors prefer the mesenterico-caval shunt using a jugular graft. This ensures a total portasystemic shunt, avoids subhepatic surgery, and reduces the long-term risk of prosthetic graft thrombosis. The MAS was reserved for cases with complete caval thrombosis. Patients with significant degrees of caval compression were satisfactorily decompressed by MCS. In patients not promptly treated, the disease progresses to cirrhosis, and such patients must be evaluated for transplantation similarly to those with other <b>hepatopathies...</b>|$|R
