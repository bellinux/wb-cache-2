25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser <b>gently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back and he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

25|$|Until the 12th century, this fort was {{consolidated}} {{and some}} houses were combined there, together, {{in a small}} hamlet. The lords of Béarn then granted the status of viguerie (a small administrative district <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages) to this new village which continued to expand <b>gently.</b> <b>In</b> Bearnese, <b>the</b> palisade was called Paü.

2500|$|Historian Andrej Mitrović {{writes of}} the song's [...] "nostalgic air [...] sorrowful melody". He {{argues that it}} {{provides}} great insight into the collective psychology and overall morale of the Serbian Army {{during the winter of}} 1915. He asserts that while the song is nostalgic, the basic idea is one of optimism. Journalist Roger Cohen describes Tamo daleko as [...] "the lament of a people uprooted". The author Robert Hudson writes that [...] "a sense of primordial identity, linked to family and nation, is embedded in [...] song, with father and son giving up their lives for the nation". Author Eric Gordy describes it {{as one of the most}} recognizable Serbian nationalist songs. During the Cold War, Serbs in the diaspora began viewing it as a form of national anthem. The song was as significant as the March on the Drina in the history of Serbian music. It became a powerful symbol of Serbian culture and national identity. In 1964, it was featured in the Bulgarian film The Peach Thief. In the early 1990s Radio Television of Serbia broadcast a documentary showing Serbian veterans returning to Corfu, with Tamo daleko playing <b>gently</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. Many variations of the song were sung by Bosnian Serb volunteers during the Bosnian War. The song remains popular amongst Serbs in the Balkans and the diaspora and several modern versions of it have been recorded, most notably by musician Goran Bregović.|$|E

25|$|Edges—convex, {{rectilinear}} or concave, {{and more}} or less even. Edges on some specimens are denticulate – scalloped – or notched. Some specimens have unsharpened edges. The profile of a hand axe's worked edges can be regular without pronounced rectilinear deviations (the edge is <b>gently</b> curved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of an S) or an edge may be more sinuous and wave-formed with pronounced curves or deviations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> edge's profile.
