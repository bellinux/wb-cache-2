After Hunyadi routed an Ottoman army in Transylvania, the sultan ordered Vlad to come to Edirne where he was captured in 1442.

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E

5|$|Jason Voorhees {{went from}} {{deceased}} child to full-grown man for Friday the 13th Part 2, and Warrington Gillette {{was hired to}} play the role. Gillette auditioned {{for the role of}} Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When Part 3 was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for Part 3, but it would have required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on Guiding Light, Daskawisz declined.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he warned them of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started {{to do their own}} recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E
