5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E

Its basic assumption is that Homo sapiens <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> its reliance on codes and signs. Language and symbolic culture must have biological roots, hence semiotic principles must apply also in the animal world.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} the life lived by John Stephens is quite complicated. William Powell <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> his {{negative}} characterization of Stephens. Much local folk history characterizes Stephens as, at best, a misguided miscreant, and at worst a criminally craven opportunist. What is clear from all accounts is that Stephens did work extensively with the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League. It is such associations – {{as well as his}} political organization of the black population – that cause the wide divergence in popular opinion surrounding his legacy.|$|E

25|$|Globally, {{pioneering}} {{experimental studies}} in the surgical technique of human organ transplantation {{were made in the}} early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, and successful transplants starting spreading worldwide after the Second World War. China herself began organ transplantation in the 1960s, which grew to an annual peak of over 13,000 transplants in 2004; and, despite some deaths from infection and hepatitis, the transplant programme has been successful in saving many lives. Though the number of transplants fell to under 11,000 annually by 2005, China still has one of the largest transplant programmes in the world. China explores innovative surgery, such as the world's first flesh and bone face transplant, performed by Professor Guo Shuzhong. Organ donation, however, has met resistance, and involuntary organ donation is illegal under Chinese law, as it is against Chinese tradition and culture, which attach symbolic life affirming importance to the kidney and heart. China <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> encountering donation difficulties; demand outstrips supply in most countries. The world-wide shortage has encouraged some countries—such as India—to trade in human organs. Reports of organs being removed from executed prisoners in China for sale internationally had been circulating since the mid-1980s, when a 1984 regulation made it legal to harvest organs from convicted criminals with the consent of the family or if the body goes unclaimed. Development of an immunosuppressant drug, cyclosporine A, made transplants a more viable option for patients.|$|E
500|$|The German {{government}} {{has said that}} it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a [...] "commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism" [...] whose [...] "totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany's democratic society". Accordingly, the German {{government has}} taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> opposing Scientology; in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether. Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the UK.|$|E

After making enemies with and killing a gang leader named Rust, Riddick familiarizes himself with the facility, and soon instigates a riot; during the confusion, he escapes into the prison's sewer system.

A woman named Shirah (Kristin Lehman) tells Riddick that he [...] "has been blind too long", and he gains his trademark [...] "eyeshine" [...] night vision. Afterwards, he accuses Pope Joe of tampering with his eyes; Joe says that he merely treated Riddick's injured arm. Riddick then continues his escape, while using the eyeshine to his advantage.|$|E
500|$|Elspeth learns {{from her}} premonitions, and her cat Maruman's prophecies, that a keeper from Obernewtyn, a feared {{institution}} where Misfits {{are sent to}} work, will come to take her there. Soon, when delivering tea to visiting Head Keeper of Obernewtyn, Madam Vega, Elspeth accidentally reveals she is a Misfit, though not to what extent, and is soon dispatched to Obernewtyn. Her first few weeks at Obernewtyn are spent in the kitchen, where she is worked to the bone. The cook’s daughter delights in tormenting her. The favoured Misfit, Ariel, and farm overseer, Rushton, immediately dislike her. Later reassigned to the farm, an encounter {{with a pair of}} Misfits named Matthew and Dameon reveals she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> her particular abilities. She also befriends Cameo, a delicate, pretty Misfit of whom Matthew is very fond. Elspeth, plagued by nightmares, begins to feel there is a dark secret underneath their everyday tasks. While working, Elspeth decides to test the range of her telepathic ability, [...] "farseeking", but beyond the boundaries of Obernewtyn, a strange machine, the Zebkrahn, traps her mind. She is only freed by combining her mental strength with another anonymous mind who offers assistance. Asked by Vega to look out for [...] "special" [...] Misfits, her interview reveals the Doctor is a defective simpleton; his [...] "assistant", Alexi, has no interest in Elspeth in his quest to find the [...] "right one" [...] who will lead him to what he desires. Elspeth and Matthew later deduce that tortuous experiments on their kind are occurring, and they resolve to escape. Cameo begins disappearing from her bed at nighttime, and Elspeth fearfully suspects that Cameo is the subject of some of these experiments.|$|E

2500|$|Urkowitz <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> finding {{evidence}} to support the early draft theory. One of the main arguments as to the early draft theory is how True Tragedy and 3 Henry VI use Holinshed and Hall. Whereas in True Tragedy, Shakespeare uses Hall more than Holinshed, in 3 Henry VI the use of Hall and Holinshed is roughly equal. The argument is that this difference cannot be accounted for by faulty reporting, and instead must represent revision on Shakespeare's part; [...] "The nature of the differences between True Tragedy and 3 Henry VI in terms of factual details, diction, and interpretive commentary by Hall and Holinshed reasonably suggests a direction of change, as well as the presence of an informed agency at work in revising the play reported by True Tragedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eclecticism thus {{means the}} {{application}} of the psychological method to the history of philosophy. Confronting the various systems co-ordinated as sensualism, idealism, skepticism, mysticism, with the facts of consciousness, the chasm result was reached [...] " [...] that each system expresses an order of phenomena and ideas, which is in truth very real, but which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> consciousness, and which at the same time holds an almost exclusive place in the system; whence it follows that each system is not false but incomplete, and that in re-uniting all incomplete systems, we should have a complete philosophy, adequate to the totality of consciousness." [...] Philosophy, as thus perfected, would not be a mere aggregation of systems, as is ignorantly supposed, but an integration of the truth in each system after the false or incomplete is discarded.|$|E

2500|$|Many reformers – Galbraith <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> this – have {{as their}} basic {{objection}} {{to a free}} market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people to have what they want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, {{in a review of}} The New Industrial State, points at Galbraith's lack for empiricism and selectiveness in the his use of evidence. He points out that [...] "It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver's Travels by debating whether there really are any little people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren't made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Urkowitz <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> finding {{evidence}} to support the early draft theory. For example, in The Contention, Margery Jourdayne is referred to as [...] "the cunning witch of Ely", but in 2 Henry VI she is referred to merely as [...] "the cunning witch." [...] The traditional argument to explain this disparity is that such information was added by either Shakespeare or someone else during rehearsals, but was not found in the prompt book which was used to print the First Folio. However, R.B. McKerrow argues against the likelihood of this theory. He asks why a writer would go back to a chronicle source to add a piece of information which is of no importance dramatically, and brings nothing to the scene. McKerrow suggests that the line was cut after performance. A similar example is found in Act 4, Scene 7 where Cade orders his men to kill Lord Saye and Sir James Comer. In 2 Henry VI, Cade orders them to cut off Saye's head and then go to Cromer's house and kill him, but in The Contention, he tells them to bring Saye to [...] "Standard in Cheapside", and then go to Cromer's house in [...] "Mile End Green." [...] McKerrow argues that such unimportant detail suggests removal after performance rather than addition before performance.|$|E
