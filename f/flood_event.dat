40|$|This paper {{looks into}} the <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> of the past 500 years in the SW Netherlands {{addressing}} the issue what kind of <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> have occurred and which ones have mainly natural causes and which ones are predominantly human induced. The <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> are classified into two major categories: (a) <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> that were caused during storm surges and (b) <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> which happened during war fare. From both categories a selection of <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> has been made. Each <b>flooding</b> <b>event</b> is discussed in terms time, location, extent of the flooded area and specific conditions. Among these conditions specific weather circumstances and how long they lasted, the highest water levels reached and dike maintenance are discussed as far as <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> caused during storm surges are concerned. About the <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> during war fare, offensive and defensive strategies are relevant. The paper demonstrates that although the strategic <b>flooding</b> <b>events</b> obviously were man-made, the natural feature, being the use of fresh water or sea water, of these events also played a major role. <b>Flooding</b> <b>events</b> caused during storm surge may have an obvious natural cause, but {{the extent of the}} flooding and damage it caused were largely determined by man...|$|R
30|$|Frequency and {{intensity}} of extreme weather phenomena are expected to increase {{as a result of}} global climate change, leading to an anticipated increase of the occurrence of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> in some geographic regions [30, 37, 63]. Disturbance and re-suspension of sediments during processes such as <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> and dredging activities can increase the bioavailability of adsorbed contaminants [26, 28, 40, 67]. Consequently, there is great concern about exposure of aquatic biota to sediment-bound contaminants resulting from the increased occurrence of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> [72]. For example, Hollert et al. [28] found that toxic effects during <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> were caused by remobilization of particle-bound pollutants in the river Neckar, Germany. Furthermore, Wölz et al. [71] demonstrated that <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> with discharges corresponding to a 5 -year average recurrence interval led to a tenfold increase in bioassay-derived toxicity equivalents of suspended particulate matter (SPM). Finally, several novel laboratory studies that combined methods from hydraulic engineering and ecotoxicology for exposure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to simulated <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> demonstrated that associated effects, including induction of biotransformation enzymes and genotoxicity, were elevated after exposure [8, 18, 29].|$|R
40|$|At {{this moment}} no {{long-term}} records are available that reveal the upstream origin of sediment deposited during <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> in the Rhine. Tracing flood deposits {{in the lower}} Rhine back to Rhine subcatchments would increase the ability to trace sources of pollution, of <b>flood</b> <b>events,</b> and to reconstruct geomorphological developments throughout the catchment. In this research a data set of fluvial deposits throughout the Rhine catchment was created, covering both the Lower Rhine, the Oberrhein and three main tributaries (Neckar, Main and Moselle rivers). The data set was built up by corings from the lower Rhine and its upstream subcatchments and surface samples from locations throughout the subcatchments. Grain size analysis was performed on these samples to identify <b>flood</b> <b>events.</b> A XRF scan was performed to obtain the chemical composition of the samples. Chemical composition data was used to investigate the distribution and propagation of trace elements. Grain size data and chemical composition data were combined to find a correlation between specific set of elements and grain size fractions. Based on data analysis combined ith previous research, the Zr/Rb ratio was found to correlate with the sand fraction of the grain size data, and thus {{to act as a}} proxy for <b>flood</b> <b>events.</b> The Zr/Rb ratio was used to identify <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> in the chemical composition data, and to characterize the chemical composition of these <b>flood</b> <b>events.</b> The chemical composition of the corings and surface samples from the subcatchments were used to characterize the chemical composition of the subcatchments. Based on a combination of these characteristics an origin was suggested for some of the <b>flood</b> <b>events.</b> The 1671 and 1682 <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> are likely originate from the Oberrhein area.

5|$|In New Jersey, Doria {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 54mph (87km/h) and storm tides 5.3feet (1.6m) above normal in Atlantic City. The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971USD, $ USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47km) path. The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29inches (261mm) in Little Falls. Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84inches (199mm) and Trenton with 7.55inches (192mm). The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state. The Beden Brook crested at over 5feet (1.5m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton. The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8feet (3m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The heavy rainfall overtopped the levee system in Zarephath, causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening {{in the fall of}} 1971. The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water, and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18inches (457mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year <b>flood</b> <b>event.</b> Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised the beams of the plant to withstand a 500-year <b>flood</b> <b>event.</b> Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township.

40|$|Flood {{coverage}} is {{excluded from the}} standard homeowners insurance policy, but many American homeowners {{are not aware of}} this exclusion. As a result, <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> may provide new information to policyholders and allow them to update the probability of homeowners insurance losses.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{multiple}} regression {{is used to}} analyze the influences of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas on the channel siltation and fluvial process of the lower Yellow River based on the <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from 1950 to 1985. The results showed that the <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas carry larger amounts of sediment load and coarser particle sizes than from other source areas, which increases deposition in the lower river channel. And there exist good correlations between channel siltation of the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the coming water and sediment of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas. Through these correlations, the amounts of sediment deposition in the lower river channel could be roughly estimated based on the runoff and sediment load of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas. The sediment deposition caused the fluvial process. There exists a complex response of channel form change to the coming water and sediment load of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas. When the sediment concentration is smaller than 200 kg/m(3), the ratio between wide-depth ratio after flood and wide-depth ratio before flood((B/h) (a) /(B/h) (b)) Will increase with the increase of the maximum sediment concentration; when the sediment concentration is near 200 kg/m(3), (B/h) (a) /(B/h) (b) reaches the maximum value; and when the sediment concentration reaches the limits of hyperconcentrated flow, (B/h) (a) /(B/h) (b) will decrease with the increase of the maximum sediment concentration. Generally, <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas made channel form of the lower Yellow River deeper and narrower, but a large amount of sediment deposition simultaneously occurs. So, the impacts of <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> from the coarse sediment producing areas on the channel of the lower Yellow River are lessened...|$|R

5|$|The sheer {{magnitude}} of the <b>flood</b> <b>event</b> in the Anilao–Malbasag watershed made the region more vulnerable to future flood events. Hillsides became more unstable and the rivers themselves were clogged with debris, raising their water levels and widening their banks. In a post-disaster assessment in October 1992, it was stated that swift cooperation of all agencies from local to governmental was necessary to prevent tragedies of similar caliber in the future. It was urged that residents still living along the river banks be relocated to safer areas; however, {{by the time of}} the report, people had already begun repopulating the area. As a way of avoiding similar breaching of the riverbank, it was suggested that the two rivers be dredged and possibly re-channeled. Several points were also brought up about rehabilitating the landscape of the watershed: reforestation, contoured farming, and redesigning of plantations to better retain rainwater. Long-term rehabilitation of the watershed was deemed necessary in addition to repairing infrastructure in Ormoc.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} wrought by Typhoon Durian just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits {{to be held in}} Cebu were postponed {{as a result of the}} forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of Durian had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30casualties reported and the damage toll reaching US$15.8million. Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104passengers and crew. Following the storm, relief agencies began to allocate resources to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst <b>flood</b> <b>event</b> in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period.

5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 <b>flood</b> <b>event.</b> Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.

40|$|Solute {{concentration}} variations during <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> {{were investigated}} in a karst aquifer of the Swiss Jura. Observations {{were made at}} the spring, and at the three main subterraneous tributaries feeding the spring. A simple transient flow and transport numerical model was able to reproduce chemographs and hydrographs observed at the spring, {{as a result of}} a mixing of the concentration and discharge of the respective tributaries. Sensitivity analysis carried out with the model showed that it is possible to produce chemical variations at the spring even if all tributaries have constant (but different for each of them) solute concentrations. This process is called tributary mixing. The good match between observed and modelled curves indicate that, in the phreatic zone, tributary mixing is probably an important process that shapes spring chemographs. Chemical reactions and other mixing components (e. g. from low permeability volumes) have a limited influence. Dissolution-related (calcium, bicarbonate, specific conductance) and pollution-related parameters (nitrate, chloride, potassium) displayed slightly different behaviours: during moderate <b>flood</b> <b>events,</b> the former showed limited variations compared to the latter. During large <b>flood</b> <b>events,</b> both presented chemographs with significant changes. No significant event water participates in moderate <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> and tributary mixing will be the major process shaping chemographs. Variations are greater for parameters with higher spatial variability (e. g. pollution-related). Whereas for large <b>flood</b> <b>events,</b> the contribution of event water becomes significant and influences the chemographs of all the parameters. As a result, spring water vulnerability to an accidental pollution is low during moderate <b>flood</b> <b>events</b> and under base flow conditions. It strongly increases during large <b>flood</b> <b>events,</b> because event water contributes to the spring discharge...|$|R
