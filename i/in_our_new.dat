5|$|On 12–13 April 1916 near Beit Ayeesa, Mesopotamia, Naik Shahamad Khan was {{in charge}} of a machine-gun {{covering}} a gap <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> line within 150 yards of the entrenched enemy. He beat off three counter-attacks and worked his gun single-handed after all his men, except two belt-fillers, had become casualties. For three hours he held the gap under very heavy fire and when his gun was knocked out, he and his two belt-fillers held their ground with rifles until ordered to withdraw. With help he then brought back his gun, ammunition and one severely wounded man, and finally all remaining arms and equipment.|$|E
500|$|Islamic historians often cite {{a letter}} that they claim Heraclius wrote to Muhammad: [...] "I have {{received}} your letter with your ambassador and I testify {{that you are the}} messenger of God found <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> Testament. Jesus, son of Mary, announced you." [...] According to the Muslim sources reported by El-Cheikh, he tried to convert the ruling class of the Empire, but they resisted so strongly that he reversed his course and claimed that he was just testing their faith in Christianity. El-Cheikh notes that these accounts of Heraclius add [...] "little to our historical knowledge" [...] of the emperor; rather, they {{are an important part of}} [...] "Islamic kerygma," [...] attempting to legitimate Muhammad's status as a prophet.|$|E

[...] "We believe that establishing Sandia as our lead laboratory is an important step <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> path forward. The independent, expert review that the scientists at Sandia will perform will help ensure that the technical and scientific basis for the Yucca Mountain repository is without question," [...] OCRWM’s Acting Director Paul Golan said. [...] "Sandia has unique experience in managing scientific investigations in support of a federally licensed geologic disposal facility, having served in that role as the scientific advisor to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico." [...] Sandia began acting as the lead laboratory on October 1, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, {{with the}} {{establishment}} of the modern State of Israel, the idea of [...] restoring the traditional form of semikhah and reestablishing a new [...] "Sanhedrin" [...] became popular among some within the religious Zionist community. Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon, Israel's first minister of religious affairs, promoted this idea {{in a series of articles}} in the Religious Zionist periodicals [...] "Sinai" [...] and [...] "Hatzofeh," [...] later gathered together in monograph form as [...] "Renewing the Sanhedrin <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> State." [...] A small number of religious Zionist rabbis of Modern Orthodox Judaism's Rabbinical Council of America voiced support for this idea; some rabbis within Conservative Judaism entertained the idea as a potentially positive development. However, most secular Jews, most Haredim, and most non-Orthodox Jews did not approve of this goal. Israel's Chief Ashkenazic rabbi at the time, Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was hesitant to support this goal, and the idea eventually died away.|$|E
2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't want to do that. We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of the fact that we had not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end because we got what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E
