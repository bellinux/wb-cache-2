5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of Ölvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl Páll, it also notes that Ölvir's ships were smaller. Ölvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, Ólafr Hrólfsson, attacked Ölvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them in a short time. Ölvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl Páll's own ship. When he spotted Earl Páll, Ölvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl Páll, a great shout goes up; but <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at Ölvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although Ölvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. Ölvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. Ölvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops—the battle was lost. Earl Páll pursued Ölvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of Ölvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl Páll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl Páll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl Rögnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl Rögnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl Páll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking more}} captives and booty, the raiders left Mindoro {{to return to}} Mindanao. They put into the river of a little {{uninhabited}} island to get water and wood. <b>Just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time Governor Bravo, who was hastily returning to Manila after he had received news of the pirates, passed the island. He passed so {{near the mouth of}} the river, in three small boats with very few men, that it was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy. He learned that the enemy was there, and then he met with the twelve vessels sent from Manila in search of the raiders. The governor ordered the commander to make more haste and gave him some of his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day before, whereupon they went to attack them. However, the sentinels of the raiders raised the alarm, and they left the river in haste, throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order to flee more lightly.|$|E

[...] "Fortunately, I arrived <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment, picked her up and carried her back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus," [...] recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa."

500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had come up on the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. <b>Just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, jib-boom, spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E

2500|$|After {{considering}} {{the use of}} similar words in Syriac, Greek and Latin in the 6th century, Herbert Thurston, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that [...] "there {{is little or no}} trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050," [...] (though a later pious tale attributed to Ildephonsus of Toledo (fl. 7th century) the use of the first part, namely the angel's greeting Mary, without that of Elizabeth, as a prayer). All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office or Cursus of the Blessed Virgin which <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time was coming into favour among the monastic orders.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1363, King John II of France {{wrote to}} Pope Urban, {{requesting}} that Cardinal de Talleyrand be sent on a legation to him. [...] The Pope replied on 25 May, that the College of Cardinals {{did not think}} that it was appropriate for him to be sent <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, and so the Pope apologized {{for not being able to}} carry out the King's request. [...] The request was sufficiently important that the Pope discussed it with the cardinals, and it is significant that he accepted their viewpoint. The reason for the request is unknown. [...] Zacour conjectures that King John was finding opposition to the planned crusade, and wanted help; it is difficult to see how Talleyrand could have helped, or why the cardinals would refuse. [...] Zacour also conjectures that the College of Cardinals did not authorize the mission because Talleyrand did not want it to, because he was more interested in his affairs in Naples; it is difficult to see how Talleyrand's influence could have outweighed that of King John and Pope Urban with the cardinals, especially in the matter of a crusade.|$|E
2500|$|Today, Liszt's {{songs are}} {{relatively}} obscure. As an exception, most frequently the song [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] is cited. It {{is because of}} a single bar, most resembling the opening motif of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. While it is commonly claimed that Liszt wrote that motif ten years before Wagner started work on his masterpiece, it has turned {{out that this is}} not true: the original version of [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] was composed in 1844 or 1845. There are four manuscripts, and only a single one, a copy by August Conradi, contains the said bar with the Tristan motif. It is on a paste-over in Liszt's hand. Since {{in the second half of}} 1858 Liszt was preparing his songs for publication, and he <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time received the first act of Wagner's Tristan, it is most likely that the version on the paste-over was a quotation from Wagner. This is not to say the motif was originally invented by Wagner. An earlier example can be found in bar 100 of Liszt's Ballade No. 2 in B minor for piano, composed in 1853.|$|E

2500|$|During the 11th century, as {{the number}} of monasteries grew, so did Marian prayers. There is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an {{accepted}} devotional formula before about 1050. All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office or Cursus of the Blessed Virgin which <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time was coming into favour among the monastic orders. Two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show that the words [...] "Ave Maria" [...] etc. and [...] "benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui" [...] occurred in almost every part of the Cursus, and though {{it is not clear that}} these clauses were at first joined together so as to make one prayer, there is conclusive evidence that this had come to pass only a very little later. As regards the addition of the word [...] "Jesus," [...] it is commonly said that this was due to the initiative of Pope Urban IV (1261) although the evidence does not seem sufficiently clear to warrant positive statement on the point. This was the prayer as known to Thomas Aquinas when he gave a Lenten sermon on the [...] "Salutation of the Blessed Virgin" [...] in 1273. By the fourteenth century it was not uncommon to conclude with an appeal for sinners and especially for help at the hour of death. Official recognition of the Ave Maria in its complete form was finally given in the Roman Breviary of 1568.|$|E
2500|$|Tiberius Gracchus (163–133). His {{maternal}} {{grandfather was}} Scipio Africanus. His father Tiberius Gracchus Major was twice consul, a powerful man {{at his death}} in 150. The young widow Cornelia Africana [...] "a highly cultivated and notable woman" [...] declined marriage to an Egyptian king to raise her children. She was [...] "a highly cultivated and notable woman". Mommsen (1854–56; 1957) at IV: 250 (Bk.IV, ch.XIII near end). Her eldest son Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus [...] "in all his relations and views... belonged to the Scipionic circle" [...] sharing its [...] "refined and thorough culture" [...] which was both Greek and Roman. Tiberius [...] "was of a good and moral disposition, of gentle aspect and quiet bearing, apparently fitted for anything rather than for an agitator of the masses." [...] At that time political reform was widely discussed among aristocrats; yet the senate always avoided it. Tiberius declared for reform. Perhaps he was personally motivated by an incident as questor with the Army on campaign in Hispania: there he had escaped a terrible ordeal because of his elite connections. Reformist ideals of this [...] "young, upright and proud man" [...] were nourished by Hellenic rhetoricians. [...] "hen his intentions became known... there was no want of approving voices, and many a public placard summoned the grandson of Africanus {{to think of the}} poor people and the deliverance of Italy." [...] In 134 he became a tribune of the people. [...] "The fearful consequences of the previous misgovernment, the political, military, economic, and moral decay of the burgesses, were <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time naked and open to the eyes of all. ... So Gracchus immediately after entering on office, proposed the enactment of an agrarian law." [...] The land reform was to benefit small holders, to restore prosperity to the [...] "free farmers" [...] of Italy; it concerned rural state lands de facto long held in the possession of wealthy families both of Rome and of Latin allies. His proposed law seemed to garner senate support, but it was effectively vetoed by another tribune acting on behalf of powerful Roman landowners; twice his bill was vetoed. Tiberius Gracchus then turned to the people's assembly, which deposed the offending tribune and itself passed the land reform law.|$|E
