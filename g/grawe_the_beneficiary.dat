50|$|Psychotherapy Research is a {{bimonthly}} peer-reviewed academic journal covering {{research in}} all fields of psychotherapy: outcome, process, {{education and training}} of therapists, as well as investigations of services. It is published by Routledge {{on behalf of the}} Society for Psychotherapy Research. The founding team of editors consisted of David Alan Shapiro (Leeds University), Hans Strupp, and Klaus <b>Grawe.</b> <b>The</b> current editors are Jeffrey A. Hayes (Penn State University) and Wolfgang Lutz (University of Trier).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{receives}} policy proceeds {{upon the}} insured person's death. The owner designates <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{is not a}} party to the policy. The owner can change <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> unless <b>the</b> policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. If a policy has an irrevocable beneficiary, any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing would require the agreement of <b>the</b> original <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the {{probate court}} determines that the {{doctrine}} applies to a lifetime gift {{made to a}} will <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>beneficiary's</b> gift under <b>the</b> will is reduced by <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> has already received. For example, if the will bequeaths $5,000 to a <b>beneficiary,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> received a lifetime gift of $4,000 from testator that was intended to partially satisfy the gift under <b>the</b> will, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> will receive only $1,000 under the will. If the will provides that <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receives {{a percentage of the}} testator's estate, the court may engage in a hotchpot calculation to determine the amount, if any, that <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> should receive under the will. If the value of the lifetime gift received is greater than <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> calculated share under <b>the</b> will, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receives nothing under the will, but does not return any of the lifetime gifts.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} that <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is already present in the United States legally at the start date of employment, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> can start working based on the {{approved}} Form I-129. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> need not demonstrate to anybody {{that he or she}} has non-immigrant intent and {{that he or she is}} not inadmissible. However, if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is not in the United States (or whenever <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> next travels outside the United States), then <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> needs to apply for a visa to enter the United States, and the consular officer evaluating the visa has three broad grounds for not accepting the application: ...|$|R
50|$|In case (2), <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{can request}} <b>the</b> {{applicant}} to specify his/her bank (<b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> bank) as <b>the</b> advising bank in an L/C application. In many countries, this is beneficial to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> who may avail {{themselves of the}} reduced bank charges and fees because of special relationships with the bank. Under normal circumstances, advising charges are standard and minimal. In addition, {{it is more convenient}} to deal with <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> own bank over a bank with which <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> does not maintain an account.|$|R
50|$|The {{protection}} of the spendthrift trust extends solely to the property {{that is in the}} trust. Once the property has been distributed to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> that property can be reached by a creditor, except to the extent the distributed property is used to support <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> If a trust calls for a distribution to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> refuses such distribution and elects to retain property in the trust, the spendthrift {{protection of}} the trust ceases with respect to that distribution and <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> creditors can now reach trust assets.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{is already}} in the United States in a valid status and with no {{requirement}} to leave the United States, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> can simply transition to H-2A status. If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is outside <b>the</b> United States, two additional steps are needed: ...|$|R
50|$|A vested {{interest}} {{refers to an}} inheritance right which has become unconditionally fixed and established in <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> with <b>the</b> result that it forms an asset in <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> estate; it may be disposed of by him or her inter vivos or mortis causa; and it is normally transmissible to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> heirs on his death (unless the right is purely personal to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> such as a usufruct).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of a {{charitable}} trust was on welfare. The government wanted {{to force the}} trustee to make distributions to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> (which would cut <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> welfare and save the government money). However, since the trustee had absolute discretion, the trustee could choose {{not to make a}} distribution to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> (Note: Recent legislation makes it easier for the government to compel the trustee to make a distribution).|$|R
5000|$|The Advising Bank is {{the bank}} that will inform <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary</b> or their Nominated Bank of the credit, send the {{original}} credit to <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary</b> or their Nominated Bank, and provide <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary</b> or their Nominated Bank with any {{amendments to the}} letter of credit.|$|R
50|$|A spendthrift {{provision}} {{creates an}} irrevocable trust preventing creditors from attaching {{the interest of}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in <b>the</b> trust before that interest (cash or property) is actually distributed to him or her. Most well drafted irrevocable trusts contain spendthrift provisions even though <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are not known to be spendthrifts. This is because such a provision protects the trust and <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in <b>the</b> event a <b>beneficiary</b> is sued and a judgment creditor attempts to attach <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> interest in <b>the</b> trust.|$|R
50|$|Generally, a {{properly}} drafted third-party, discretionary trust is not countable {{as an asset}} available to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or Medicaid benefits. Such a trust must be created by a party other than <b>the</b> SSI/Medicaid <b>beneficiary,</b> must not receive any assets belonging to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> and must be restricted (not accessible or available) to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> <b>The</b> operative principle is whether the trust assets or income are available to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> If appropriate trust language is used (and the appropriate language varies from state to state), Medicaid will not treat the resources in the trust as a countable resource.|$|R
5000|$|Beneficiaries {{will only}} receive grant and bond moneys {{up until the}} year in which they turn 49 years old. Monies can be contributed to the RDSP until the end of {{the year in which}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> turns 59. Payments to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> must begin when <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> turn 60.|$|R
5000|$|... {{when the}} {{property}} can't vest because <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is unknown (for example, if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is a class subject to open), or ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{insurance}} {{proceeds will}} be included in <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> taxable estate at his or her subsequent death. If the proceeds are used to pay the insured's estate taxes, it would at first appear that the proceeds could not be on hand to be taxed at <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> subsequent death. However, using insurance proceeds to pay the insured's estate taxes effectively increases <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> estate since <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> will not have to sell inherited assets to pay such taxes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{would now}} be {{implemented}} during the entire race. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> was discontinued when less than ten laps remained in the race.|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} issues {{evolving}} around {{the identification of}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in <b>the</b> last payment order in the credit transfer received by the last bank in the transfer chain (2 ̆ 2 beneficiary 2 ̆ 7 s bank 2 ̆ 2), the duties of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> 2 ̆ 7 s bank {{in the case of}} an ambiguous description of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in <b>the</b> payment order, and the liability of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> 2 ̆ 7 s bank in case it broke such duties...|$|R
5000|$|Bank guarantee: It is an undertaking/promise {{given by}} a Bank {{on behalf of the}} Applicant and in favour of <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary.</b> Whereas, <b>the</b> Bank has agreed and {{undertakes}} that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary,</b> then <b>the</b> Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary</b> upon receipt of a demand or claim from <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> may {{elect to}} choose from one of two methods of {{distribution}}. The first option is to receive the entire distribution by December 31 of the fifth year following {{the year of the}} IRA owner's death. The second option is to receive portions of the IRA as distributions over the life of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> terminating upon <b>the</b> death of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> and passing on to a secondary <b>beneficiary.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of <b>the</b> Roth IRA is a trust, the trust must distribute the entire assets of the Roth IRA by December 31 of the fifth year following the year of the IRA owner's death, unless there is a [...] "Look Through" [...] clause, in which case the distributions of the Roth IRA are based on the Single Life Expectancy table over the life of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> terminating upon <b>the</b> death of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Subtract one (1) from the [...] "Single Life Expectancy" [...] for each successive year. The age of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is determined on 12/31 of the first year after the year that the owner died.|$|R
50|$|In such a {{trust assets}} are ordinarily held {{to pay an}} income to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> <b>The</b> <b>beneficiary</b> may also have access to capital of the trust with the trustee's permission. The right to receive income from a trust would ordinarily be an asset {{in the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> and could be sold, thwarting the {{intention}} of the donor to spread the gift over the recipient's lifetime. Additionally on a bankruptcy the right to the income would be sold by <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> trustee in bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|Jus accrescendi, or {{the right}} of accrual, is <b>the</b> right of <b>beneficiaries</b> to whom an {{interest}} in property has been left jointly to take the share {{of one of them}} who fails to take his or her share. Such failure may take place by the death of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> before vesting occurs; or by <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> incapacity to take his or her share; or by <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> refusal to adiate.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> {{income level}} {{is less than}} $21,287, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> should receive annual Government of Canada Disability Savings Bonds, to a {{lifetime}} maximum of $20,000 per RDSP. Add also the Canada Disability Savings Grant, if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> income is $75,769 or less for an additional $3,500/yr, to a lifetime maximum of $70,000. This works out such that, if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> over <b>the</b> age of 18 meets the appropriate income levels, an initiation contribution of $1,500 can result in $3,500 in matching government funds. There are complex rules governing the withdrawal of funds from RDSPs that could potentially see <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> having to repay government grant and bond moneys if withdrawals are made before the funds have vested {{for a period of}} 10 years.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} {{reported here}} directly address the following primary research {{questions related to}} the three outcomes. Each question concerns the impact of duration from the month before the rollout start in <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> state to <b>the</b> month in which SSA mailed a Ticket to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> (<b>the</b> <b>beneficiary’s</b> “mail month”) on outcomes over the 48 months after the rollout start.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> for <b>the</b> power {{generated}} from NTPP are : Indian Railways - 90 % and Bihar State - 10 %. PPA has been signed {{with both of}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Payment- When {{the hand}} is finished, the auction winner must pay the bid. If he hasn’t made enough tricks (Playing Up), he must {{give up the}} ones he has and the {{difference}} deducted from his score and added to <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary’s.</b> Playing Down, <b>the</b> auction winner will receive from <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>the</b> number of tricks bid, so that his score is deducted and not <b>the</b> <b>Beneficiary’s,</b> provided he hasn’t won any more than that.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{the trust}} may provide income tax relief by being taxed {{at a lower}} {{marginal}} rate than if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> total assets were considered. However if the trust was established for {{a person with a}} disability in Canada, who has qualified for the Disability Tax Credit the trustees can use <b>the</b> [...] "Preferred <b>Beneficiary</b> election" [...] and attribute the trust income to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of <b>the</b> trust without actually paying it out. <b>The</b> trust <b>beneficiary</b> would file a tax return as if they earned the trust income. <b>The</b> trust <b>beneficiary</b> would use their personal exemptions and tax credits to reduce their taxable income. It {{can also be used to}} shield assets from matrimonial division in case of divorce of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> In most cases, the trust assets are immune from claims by creditors of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two-step filing (allowed for all categories): The {{petitioner}} files Form I-130, {{and after}} it is approved, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> name is added to a queue of people awaiting immigrant visas. After a wait time (that depends on <b>the</b> category), <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> adjustment of status application {{is ready to be}} processed and <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> files Form I-485 to adjust status to that of a Permanent Resident.|$|R
50|$|The Ticket Holder and EN work {{together}} until <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> reaches {{his or her}} work goal. The EN will continue to provide ongoing support services even after <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> gets a job if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> needs help keeping the job or getting a better paying one. Once the Ticket Holder is earning income at a level that justifies a payment to the EN, according to the Ticket program’s predetermined standards, the EN applies to the OSM for payment from Social Security. The EN cannot charge <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> for any services it provides through the Ticket Program.|$|R
5000|$|After showing <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in {{a typical}} {{situation}} for few minutes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, Anthony would arrive, deliver the check, and have <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> sign a legal statement binding him or her never to reveal the source of this million-dollar gift except to a spouse (if the recipient was single, Anthony would add, [...] "... should you marry"), under penalty of forfeit. Once the document was signed and the thanks were given, Anthony disappeared from <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> life, never to return. The remainder of the episode showed how the gift affected <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{a person}} dies, the funds in their HSA are {{transferred}} to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> named for <b>the</b> account. If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is a surviving spouse, the transfer is tax-free. If <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> {{is not a}} spouse, the account stops being an HSA, and the fair {{market value of the}} HSA (less any unreimbursed qualified medical expenses of the decedent paid within the 1 year anniversary of his death) becomes taxable to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> in <b>the</b> year in which the HSA owner dies. There is no stretch provision for non-spouse beneficiaries unlike for IRAs and 401ks: when <b>the</b> non-spouse <b>beneficiary</b> inherits, <b>the</b> person pays income tax on the whole amount that year, with no stretching out.|$|R
50|$|Only one RDSP account may {{be set up}} per {{qualifying}} individual, {{and only}} that beneficiary is entitled to any payments. An RDSP arrangement must be between the issuer and either <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> a qualifying person in relation to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> or a legal parent {{who is not a}} qualifying person, but who is a holder of another RDSP of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> A qualifying person can only establish and administer an RDSP on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> lacks <b>the</b> mental capacity to do so himself of herself. A disabled adult with mental capacity who wished to benefit from an RDSP must establish the plan himself or herself, however, family members, friends or others could contribute to a plan established by the disabled person, with his or her permission.|$|R
50|$|When {{a special}} needs trust is created {{and funded by}} someone other than <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>the</b> trust can provide the trustee with much greater {{latitude}} to make distributions. Furthermore, {{the government is not}} entitled to recover any expenditures made for <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> from <b>the</b> trust corpus remaining at the end of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> life. These two benefits make third-party special needs trusts strongly preferable to any of the self-settled special needs trusts established under federal law.|$|R
50|$|Where <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are all sui juris, {{and between}} them {{absolutely}} {{entitled to the}} trust property, they may require the trustees to end the trusts and distribute the funds as <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> agree.|$|R
50|$|<b>GRAWE</b> is <b>the</b> fifth largest {{insurance}} group in Austria. GRAWE has subsidiaries in Central and Eastern European {{countries such as}} Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Macedonia, and Montenegro.|$|R
50|$|Conditions {{regarding}} the insolvency of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> are valid. It {{is common to}} provide that, if <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> becomes insolvent, <b>the</b> bequest lapses; accordingly, the bequest will not form part of the insolvent estate.|$|R
50|$|A {{spendthrift trust}} is a trust that is {{created for the}} benefit of a person (often unable to control his spending) that gives an {{independent}} trustee full authority to make decisions as to how the trust funds may be spent {{for the benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Creditors of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> generally cannot reach the funds in the trust, and the funds are not actually under the control of <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary.</b>|$|R
