5000|$|The weaving process {{involves}} {{two methods}} based {{on use of}} shuttles: <b>fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> loom and throw shuttle loom. In the first type it is made as a complete fabric in a single piece. In the second method, the fabric is made in twopieces and then joined by stitching {{to make it a}} full fabric. Additional motifs are woven in by hand. The fabric is [...] "porous, airy, see-through and thin", making it suitable for luxury items for women such as chadors and saris, and skirts and school uniforms for girls.|$|E

50|$|C. Rajam {{was born}} in 1882 {{in the village of}} Swamimalai, (near Kumbakonam) in Thanjavur District of Madras State (now Tamil Nadu). After {{completing}} his high school education at the Town High School, Kumbakonam, he joined the Salem Government Weaving School in 1904 to master the art of weaving process. In the beginning he established a handloom factory (<b>fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> loom) to produce dhotis, towels, shirt material etc., but latter also started trading of consumer items. After not being so successful in those business, he became a volunteer in the congress party and learnt the hardship faced by the mankind. A meeting with Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, attracted him towards the philosophical aspects of life.|$|E
50|$|The weaving {{industry}} of Sualkuchi received {{a big boost}} during the Second World War. The growing demand for fabrics and their increasing prices, encouraged a few Tanti families to introduce weaving commercially and they started weaving factories engaging hired wage weavers. Today, the factory system with semi-automatic <b>Fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> handloom has already been extended to entire Sualkuchi and 73.78% of the households of the town are being engaged with commercial weaving of hand-loom. The Census of Hand-looms in Sualkuchi conducted in 2002 reveals that Sualkuchi has 13752 active commercial hand-looms, of which 54.75% are performed by the woman weavers, who are basically hired from the outside of Sualkuchi. Although the hired wage weavers were originally the local poor from the Bamun-Sualkuchi area of the east and Bhatipara hamlet of the west, a flow of migrated wage weavers {{from different parts of}} Assam has emerged gradually since eighties of the last century and presently migrant weavers are dominating the wage weavers of the town.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{indications of}} the textile {{industry in the}} village {{can be found in}} the will of William Atkinson in 1568, in which it states that he left a solitary loom to his son-in-law. The cloth making industry remained stagnant, however, until the 18th century, when revolutionary weaving inventions such as John Kay's <b>Flying</b> <b>shuttle</b> and, later, water-powered machines such as Crompton's Spinning mule, allowed the textile industry in Addingham to leap forward as it entered the 19th century.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} very {{specifically}} defined gender roles regarding industrial production, it varies by city and by technique. In larger cities, such as Oaxaca, where industry is based around more expensive goods, such as automotive production or electronics manufacturing, men typically command factories and are engineers and directors, while women are usually in the lower positions of line workers and assistants. In villages such as San Bartolo Yautepec, where back-strap weaving is done, the weaving is done by women. These are usually lightweight fabrics used for table runners, purses and smaller items. In Teotitlán, Santa Ana del Valle and Villa Díaz Ordaz for example, rug weaving on floor looms is done primarily by men, though women also weave rugs. Women's contributions are becoming greater and many women have {{a certain degree of}} independence and autonomy through their income from weaving. But feeding, clothing and taking care of the family is usually their primary responsibility. In Mitla, <b>fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> weaving, of light-weight, but large-scale, fabrics is also more often done by men than by women, probably because of the physical effort required.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{paintings}} contain Hogarthian satire (in contrast to Bell Scott's works). In the first picture {{the wife of the}} Roman general wearing a blond wig distracts him from his work; their son - a Caligula in the making - kicks an African servant. The painting that seems to celebrate industrial technology, John Kay: Inventor of the <b>Fly</b> <b>Shuttle,</b> depicts the hysterical inventor fleeing from an unruly mob which is bent on destroying the machine. Instead of culminating in the achievement of modern Manchester, the sequence concludes with a rustic scene in a small village. According to Codell, history is portrayed as fragmented, contested, and as ending in a [...] "penultimate" [...] moment. This may be related to Brown's interest in anarchism and William Morris's utopian socialism at the time, but it also arises from disputes about the more modern subjects. Paintings depicting the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 {{and the end of the}} Lancashire Cotton Famine in 1865 had been proposed, but were rejected by the council's committee as too controversial.|$|E
5000|$|Later in the summer, 1944, the He 111 {{once again}} {{operated}} with success {{as part of}} the shrinking German bomber force. German industry began to move factories eastward, out of the range of RAF Bomber Command and United States Army Air Forces attacks. In response, the USAAF started shuttle missions to the Soviet Union in which they would continue on and land in the USSR after their mission. The USAAF would then repeat the mission and continue to England. IV. Fliegerkorps was ordered to target the airfields of the USAAF bombers. On 21 June 1944, the US Eighth Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortresses landed at Mirgorod and Poltava airfields after bombing targets in Debrecen, Hungary. The Soviets had not prepared proper anti-aircraft defences and IV. Fliegerkorps and its He 111s from KG 4, KG 53 and KG 55 dropped 91 tonnes (100 tons) of bombs destroying 44 B-17s and 15 US fighters. The He 111s flew at altitudes of 4,000-5,000 m (13,120-16,400 m), and not a single German aircraft was hit by enemy fire. Such missions were halted thereafter.The suspending of the [...] "shuttle missions" [...] (known as Operation Frantic) was assessed by the Germans {{as a result of the}} Soviet failure to provide appropriate protection. It is likely, however, that the B-17 and P-51s, which now had the range to strike anywhere in Europe, and had bases that could reach Eastern Europe in Italy, did not <b>fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> missions to the Soviet Union owing to these reasons.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} among historians that {{the roots of the}} Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the Industrial Revolution. The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the <b>Flying</b> <b>shuttle,</b> the Spinning jenny, and perhaps most importantly the Steam engine generated Economies of scale that made Mass production of in centralized locations attractive for the first time. The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.|$|R

A conventional <b>fly</b> <b>shuttle</b> loom with special modifications to weave an integral double layer triangular core fabric from quartz yarn was used.

The program is follow up of a program in which single layer rectangular cell core fabrics are woven and a single type of insulating material was inserted into the cells...|$|E
50|$|The flying shuttle {{dominated}} commercial weaving {{through the}} middle of the twentieth century. By that time, other systems had begun to supplant it. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used to throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the speed of the loom. Projectile and rapier looms eliminated the need to take the bobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms reduced the weight of moving parts further. <b>Flying</b> <b>shuttle</b> looms are still used for some purposes, and old models remain in use.|$|R
