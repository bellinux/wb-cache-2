5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil <b>engineering</b> <b>company,</b> appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping quarters and the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|Along with Engineer Gunnar Tonning, Løvold {{traveled}} {{several times}} to Oslo to meet with national politicians and authorities. In addition to Torp, he consulted the <b>engineering</b> <b>company</b> Aas-Jakobsen, the NATO office and Kolbjørn Varmann, Minister of Transport and Communications. In 1958 a joint municipal and county committee was established to follow up the plans, where Løvold was appointed chairman. Its main function was the ordering seismic surveys of Freifjorden, which gave positive results. Major Worm Eide manned for caution and stated {{that there was no}} funding available. Subsequently a committee led by Ole Mollan was appointed, which criticized the original committee for not prioritizing more critical transport investments.|$|E
5|$|Caradoc, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in December 1915 as part of the 1915–16 War Programme.

5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, as {{they did not believe}} it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & <b>Engineering</b> <b>Company</b> was accepted on 9 June.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Bridgwater {{was also}} home {{to a number of}} iron foundries. George Hennet's Bridgwater Iron Works worked on bridges, {{railways}} and machinery for Brunel and Robert Stephenson. This location allowed the import by boat of raw materials from Wales and the dispatch of finished work to south Devon using the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The carriage workshops for the latter were on an adjacent site. The works passed to his son and then traded as Hennet, Spink & Else. Some of the ironwork was produced for the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, Cornwall. In 1873 it became the Bridgwater <b>Engineering</b> <b>Company</b> Limited but this failed in 1878. W Wills Ltd produced steam locomotives and fingerposts.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{of country}} estates became common around the 1920s.

Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was {{a partner in the}} electrical <b>engineering</b> <b>company,</b> Drake and Gorham.|$|E
