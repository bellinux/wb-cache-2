5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger <b>House,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} by the family that a new and far grander <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon {{the design of the}} house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.|$|E
50|$|It {{was planned}} that {{a total of}} 145 <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built on the 3 hectare site. In total there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> 11 <b>house</b> styles, from 2 bedroom maisonettes to five bedroom family <b>houses.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a mix of {{affordable}} housing and larger private dwellings.|$|R

5|$|Sam died on 25 February 1998. While gravely {{ill with}} cancer in 1998, Joan {{unveiled}} a memorial plaque in Barony Hall, Glasgow, to commemorate her husband, {{and it was}} announced that the walled garden at Ross Priory, on Loch Lomondside, was to be named in her honour, and the Joan Curran Summer <b>House</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built there. Joan died on 10 February 1999, and was cremated at the Daldowie Crematorium. Her daughter, Sheena, three sons and three grandsons survived her.|$|E
5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> apportioned. A {{minority}} {{wanted it to be}} apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most wanted it apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith <b>House</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

50|$|Prime Minister Richard Seddon {{introduced}} the Workers' Dwellings Act in 1905 to provide well-built suburban houses for workers who earned less than £156 per annum. He argued that these <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> prevent {{the decline of}} living standards in New Zealand and increase the money available to workers without increasing the costs to employers. By breaking private landlords' control over rental housing, housing costs for everyone would decline. The bill passed by 64 votes to 2, despite criticism over {{the cost of the}} scheme, the distance the <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> from workplaces, particularly ports, and the lack of provision for Māori. Seddon estimated that 5,000 <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built under the scheme.|$|R
5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White <b>House</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E
5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a circular imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected {{the applicant}}'s redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the applicant argued before the High Court that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the applicant to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The applicant in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|One goal {{of phase}} {{one of the}} {{programme}} was of course to continue helping first-time buyers onto the property ladder by facilitating the purchase of new-build. By doing so, and by also helping existing home-owners to buy new-build, demand for new-build would increase. George Osborne claimed that, by increasing demand for new-build, the supply side of the <b>housing</b> market <b>would</b> <b>be</b> stimulated, i.e. more <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built to meet the increased demand for new-build.|$|R

25|$|The house, {{stable and}} land {{would be put}} up {{for sale in the}} spring of 1893 for unpaid taxes of $123, about $2,500 today. It also had a $2,000 {{mortgage}} left at five percent interest. In October 1893, the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sold.|$|E
25|$|Renovations {{have taken}} place since then. In 1988 the parish <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{expanded}} with new offices, a lobby and an elevator. With these completed, the church was able to celebrate its 350th anniversary in 1992 by hosting the RCA's General Synod.|$|E
25|$|In the Joseon Dynasty, kisaeng {{houses were}} {{typically}} {{located near the}} center of a town, often close to the marketplace.

25|$|Similarly, the Sifra {{taught that}} Moses sought to comfort Aaron, {{telling him that}} at Sinai, God told him that God would sanctify God's house through a great man.

But Moses said that it turned out that Aaron's sons were greater and Moses and Aaron, for through them had the house been sanctified.|$|E
25|$|While the German {{policy towards}} Jews was {{ruthless}} and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews {{was very much}} the same. The Germans would often murder non-Jewish Poles for small misdemeanors. Execution for help rendered to Jews, {{even the most basic}} kinds, was automatic. In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, everybody in the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> immediately shot by the Germans. For this thousands of non-Jewish Poles were executed.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{worked for}} the company or the {{government}} {{in one form or}} another. Residents did not own their homes; instead, they rented houses assigned primarily based on seniority in the zone. When an employee moved away, the <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> listed and employees could apply for it. The utility companies were also managed by the company. There were no independent stores; goods were brought in and sold at stores run by the company, such as a commissary, housewares, and so forth.|$|E

50|$|Following a {{campaign}} against slums by the newspaper New Zealand Truth, and the realisation that lending for mortgages was not effective to provide housing to replace them, the Finance Minister Walter Nash announced in the 1936 Budget that 5000 state <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built. The <b>houses</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> provided by private enterprise, with a Department of Housing Construction set up to oversee {{the building and the}} State Advances Corporation to manage the houses. The government intended not only to provide housing, but to stimulate jobs and manufacturing with the construction of the houses, which were to be built from New Zealand materials as far as possible. MP John A. Lee was responsible for the programme, but as he was an undersecretary rather than a minister he had limited authority.|$|R
25|$|Near {{the end of}} May, during Operation Rainbow, the Israeli army {{demolished}} {{a building}} {{across the street from the}} home of Ibrahim Hammad, one of the perpetrators of the attack on the Hatuel family. According to a neighbor, residents had already left the area on the assumption that Hammad's <b>house</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> demolished. According to Human Rights Watch, Hammad's house was not harmed but a house across the street belonging to Mahmoud Abu Arab was bulldozed instead. Abu Arab submitted a claim for compensation from the Israeli authorities.|$|E
25|$|The case {{involved}} a severely disabled lady, Miss Coughlan, who was receiving nursing care in Mardon House, a National Health Service facility {{managed by the}} North and East Devon Health Authority. The Authority had made several representations {{to her that she}} would be able to live out her days in Mardon House. Subsequently, the Health Authority decided to shut the facility down as the cost of operating it was becoming excessive. Coughlan sought judicial review of the Authority's decision, claiming that its representations had induced in her a legitimate expectation that Mardon <b>House</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> her home for life.|$|E
25|$|Justice Hidden, {{hearing the}} matter in the High Court, entered {{judgment}} for Coughlan. He held that the representations made by the Health Authority towards Coughlan and the other patients amounted to an explicit promise that Mardon <b>House</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> their home for life. The promise made was a promise to provide care at Mardon House, rather than at various unspecified locations as contended by the Health Authority. To resile from such a promise would amount to unfairness. However, in the case where an overriding public interest demanded, the Health Authority would be justified to break its promise. On {{the facts of the}} case, the Health Authority could not produce proof that there were compelling circumstances amounting to an overriding public interest to justify a departure from the promise made.|$|E
