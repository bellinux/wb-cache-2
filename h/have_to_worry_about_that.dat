McGuinness guided the county's under-21 {{side to the}} All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championship final in 2010. He {{was appointed to the}} senior management on a four-year term, with a review after two years. His first year in charge brought Donegal the National Football League Division 2 title, promotion to Division 1, the county's first championship win in four years, the county's first provincial title in 19 years, and made Donegal the third team {{in the history of the}} GAA to win a Provincial Title from the Preliminary Round. His second season brought a second consecutive provincial title, also achieved from the Preliminary Round, as well as a defeat of the mighty Kerry at Croke Park and with the win over Cork on 26 August to secure a place in the 2012 All Ireland Football Final, it looks like Jim won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> review after all.|$|E

50|$|If let's say {{gravity is}} an {{emergent}} theory of a fundamentally flat theory over a flat Minkowski spacetime, then by Noether's theorem, {{we have a}} conserved stress-energy tensor which is Poincaré covariant. If the theory has an internal gauge symmetry (of the Yang-Mills kind), we may pick the Belinfante-Rosenfeld stress-energy tensor which is gauge-invariant. As there is no fundamental diffeomorphism symmetry, we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> this tensor isn't BRST-closed under diffeomorphisms. So, the Weinberg-Witten theorem applies and we can't get a massless spin-2 (i.e. helicity ±2) composite/emergent graviton.|$|E

After Rice's death, officials could not immediately locate the letter describing his World Series play. However, in an interview, his wife Mary said, [...] "He did catch it.

5000|$|The {{case was}} {{brought back to}} public {{attention}} when, in 1975, chapters of author Truman Capote's novel Answered Prayers were set {{to be published in}} Esquire magazine's November issue. The book features thinly veiled characters that are based on Capote's friends in high society. Capote was an acquaintance of Ann's and had become convinced that she was guilty of murder (he nicknamed Woodward [...] "Bang Bang"). Capote created a character based on Ann Woodward named [...] "Ann Hopkins". She is described as a bigamist and [...] "cold blooded murderess" [...] who shoots her husband after the two arrive home one night from a party. Ann Hopkins also tells police that she mistook her husband for a burglar when, in reality, she kills her husband because he confronted her with evidence that she was having an affair and asked for a divorce. Upon learning of the impending publication of Answered Prayers, Ann Woodward consumed a cyanide pill on October 9, 1975. [...] "Well, that's that", said her mother-in-law, Elizabeth Woodward, [...] "she shot my son, and Truman just murdered her, and so now I suppose we don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> anymore." [...] However, Ann Woodward's friends said that she was already suffering from severe depression, and Capote's story exacerbated it.|$|E
5000|$|He is also {{credited}} by al-Fadl's testimony with a 1992 fatwa issued at {{the request}} of Al Qaeda leadership, described as pivotal in Al-Qaeda's development as it provided the group with justification for the killing of Muslim civilians and bystanders in the course of killing Americans and other non-Muslim enemies. The fatwa is putatively based on one by the influential 14th-century Salafi scholar Ibn Taymiyyah ("Ibn al Tamiyeh") permitting the killing of Muslim supporters of the [...] "Tartars" [...] (Mongols) who threatened to invade the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. In testimony al-Fadl was asked: Q. Can you tell us now what Abu Hajer al Iraqi said about Ibn al Tamiyeh?A. He said that our time now is similar like in that time, and he say Ibn al Tamiyeh, when a tartar come to Arabic war, Arabic countries that time, he say some Muslims, they help them. And he says Ibn al Tamiyeh, he make a fatwah. He said anybody around the tartar, he buy something from them and he sell them something, you should kill him. And also, if when you attack the tartar, if anybody around them, anything, or he's not military or that -- if you kill him, you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> If he's a good person, he go to paradise and if he's a bad person, he go to hell.|$|E
5000|$|If Ava's {{connection}} to the notorious Jerome crime family panned out, not only would West's arrival cause trouble for Port Charles's local kingpin, Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), {{but there was also}} great storyline potential for Ian Buchanan and Finola Hughes's Duke Lavery and Anna Devane who shared a quite volatile history with the Jerome family. Critics began speculating that the character would be the long lost daughter of Tonja Walker's Olivia St. John (born Jerome) despite the relatively small age difference between the actresses; however Matt Webb Motivich of TV Line also suggested that Ava could be a previously unknown child of Olivia's crime lord father, Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod). The character is immediately thrown into a major storyline as it is revealed that she is helping hide Morgan and that she Lauren's mother. According to series head writer, Ron Carlivati, [...] "This is a woman who conceived a child with Franco, so you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> right there." [...] Though Ava initially comes off as a [...] "devoted mother," [...] there is much more behind to her. At the Winter 2014 Television Critics Association press tour, West opened up about portraying Ava and how it compared to portraying Carly on World Turns. She described, [...] "I have to be honest, I work very hard. ... I wanted to create a character that was different. I loved Carly, but I can’t play her again. Then when this part came up, I thought, how am I going to play this role? She’s different. She has similarities as women do.‘How does she carry herself?’ Ava never touches her hair. Ava never moves. Ava’s a snake. She only moves when she is going to strike. And these are things I think about. This is how I wanted to create this person." [...] When asked how she keeps Ava sympathetic and vulnerable, West described, [...] "You never judge your own self. You do what you do — we all do this every day. Ava doesn’t judge herself, she does what she does because she thinks she is right. ... She is not retrospectively looking at her actions. She is just living in it. As an actor, you can’t judge your character ever. Let others judge it." ...|$|E
