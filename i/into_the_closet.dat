2500|$|Using {{a content}} {{analysis}} of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, sociologist Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men's behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men's similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual {{is often described as}} a duplicitous heterosexual man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the [...] "Brokeback" [...] white bisexual is often described in pitying language as a victimized homosexual man forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> by the heterosexist society around him.|$|E
2500|$|Hamlet {{is often}} played with {{contemporary}} political overtones: Leopold Jessner's 1926 {{production at the}} Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius' court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm. Hamlet is also a psychological play: John Barrymore introduced Freudian overtones <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> scene and mad scene of his landmark 1922 production in New York, which ran for 101 nights (breaking Booth's record). He took the production to the Haymarket in London in 1925 and it greatly influenced subsequent performances by John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. Gielgud has played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 136 performances, leading to the accolade that he was [...] "the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore." [...] Although [...] "posterity has treated Maurice Evans less kindly", throughout the 1930s and 1940s it was he, not Gielgud or Olivier, who was regarded as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/9 season he presented Broadway's first uncut Hamlet, running {{four and a half}} hours.|$|E
60|$|The {{rest of the}} day {{was spent}} most delightfully in {{establishing}} themselves in the new home. It didn't take the girl long to put her few belongings <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> and drawers, but there were a thousand little things to examine in the rooms and she made some important discovery at every turn.|$|R

60|$|Though {{in secret}} {{not a little}} crestfallen, it may be, by my phlegmatic reception, so {{different}} from what he had looked for; with much apparent alacrity he commenced the survey; throwing open the cupboards on the first floor, and peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> on <b>the</b> second; measuring one within, and then comparing that measurement with the measurement without. Removing the fireboards, he would gaze up the flues. But {{no sign of the}} hidden work yet.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{prominent}} {{gay rights}} advocates disagree. GLAAD spokesperson Damon Romine told Salon.com, [...] "Media speculation about a celebrity's orientation {{is not something}} we support. This kind of gossip can lead some people to the decision to come out, as we've seen recently, or it may drive others further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> People are going to become more guarded and secretive and not less, because they don't want to create any opportunities [...]" [...] Actor Bruce Vilanch said, [...] "What purpose does it serve? These [...] are professional homosexuals. They are gay people for a living. They have to respect the rights of homosexuals who aren't professional." [...] In an article entitled [...] "Just How Dangerous is Perez Hilton?", AfterElton.com suggested that Hilton's actions put people's careers at risk, because anti-gay bias is still a prominent part of American culture. He continued, [...] "Both as a gay man and a journalist, I question whether the gay community should approve of Hilton's actions...Being associated with someone who publishes photos of panty-less starlets and scribbles dirty notes...makes us look infantile and ridiculous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor George Chauncey of Yale University, {{a social}} {{historian}} {{who specializes in}} LGBT history, described how previous government campaigns had attempted [...] "to demonize gay people as dangerous sexual deviants and child molesters". He then analyzed campaign material from the Yes on 8 campaign to show how they played upon the same message. He analyzed the words of Dr. William Tam, which included assertions that, were California to fail to pass Proposition 8, other states would follow and [...] "fall into Satan's hands", and that following legalization of same-sex marriage, the advocates of the [...] "gay agenda" [...] would attempt to [...] "legalize having sex with children". Chauncey connected these messages to the earlier history of government demonizing gays and lesbians which he had previously discussed. Helen Zia, a scholar on Asian American social and political movements who was also asked to analyze those words, explained how her encounters with similar Asian community organizers encouraged her to [...] " [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and [...] the door." [...] David Thompson for the defense cross-examined Prof. Chauncey {{by focusing on the}} progress that had been made for mainstream acceptance of gays and lesbians in the last twenty years. Thompson noted anti-discrimination laws, support for domestic partnerships, and the proliferation of media like the sitcom Will & Grace and 2005 film Brokeback Mountain. Thompson's line of questioning was intended to establish [...] "whether systemic bias against lesbians and gay men prevents them from being treated by others as equal citizens in the political process".|$|E

6000|$|... "All right, sir," [...] {{the girl}} said, and went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> little <b>closet</b> at <b>the</b> rear for her hat and coat. Did she {{contrive}} {{to get a}} copy of that book under her coat as she passed the shelf where it lay? ...|$|R

500|$|The {{scene where}} Cruise enters <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> is {{referenced}} in the South Park {{segment of the}} opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is {{trying to get to the}} show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nearby <b>closet.</b> Immediately following <b>the</b> entrance, he exits <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and says, [...] "There's someone else in there", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open.

60|$|In the dining-room, {{a sentimental}} desire came over Flora to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dragon <b>closet</b> which had so often {{swallowed}} Arthur {{in the days}} of his boyhood--not improbably because, as a very dark closet, it was a likely place to be heavy in.
