5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay.

5|$|Obsidian is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tony Warriner, one of four founders of the adventure game developer Revolution Software. Warriner was introduced to <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> {{at the age of}} 13, as a result of which he developed an interest in game development. This interest resulted in him creating Obsidian when he should have been studying for his school exams, resulting in him failing every exam. The game was published, however, resulting in the young developer's entry into the video game industry. Revolution Software was formed 4 years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Peter Turcan, who also developed similar turn-based strategies such as Waterloo and Borodino for <b>home</b> <b>computers</b> in the 1980s.

Critics praised the graphics and presentation; however, some were divided over the historical accuracy of the battle and lack of sound.|$|E
50|$|The Newbear 77-68 {{was both}} a <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> and a homebuilt computer, since it was {{designed}} to not only be used at home (hence a <b>home</b> <b>computer),</b> but also be assembled at home by its owner (hence a homebuilt computer).|$|R
30|$|The lack of {{consistent}} results is likely also due to methodological challenges in making correct inferences about effects of <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> use from non-experimental data. Thus, the studies vary {{in the extent}} to which they control for selection bias when comparing groups of students with varying amounts of <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> use. An interesting example demonstrating this is the Fuchs and Wößmann (2004) study, which showed that as the strength of control successively increased, the <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> use effect estimates changed from being positive to negative. Vigdor et al. (2014), who also found negative effects of <b>home</b> <b>computer</b> use, used a very powerful approach to control for selection bias based on estimating student fixed effects in longitudinal data.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force.

Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond to work on the project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat Emulator was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 <b>home</b> <b>computers.</b> Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it under threat of action by Advertising Standards Agency.|$|E
