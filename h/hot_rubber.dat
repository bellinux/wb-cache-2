Cracking of pavements has {{continued to be a}} challenge for road maintenance, having detrimental effects on a pavement performance and service life, and contributing to high construction and repair costs. It is important to identify high performing materials and repair techniques that can produce lasting results, reducing the frequency of maintenance repairs and lowering the cost to the agency. With this goal in mind, the Texas Department of Transportation is performing a three-year research study to assess the performance of various crack sealing materials and methods.

Currently, <b>hot</b> <b>rubber</b> asphalt is the material most commonly used, however, a number of state {{agencies have}} been experimenting with cold pour asphalt emulsion crack sealants in order to minimize initial costs and safety concerns. The study evaluated the performance of both hot and cold poor sealants under different climatic and environmental conditions, investigating issues such as cost effectiveness and ease and safety of installation. Three cold pour and four hot pour crack and joint sealants were tested on eight different roads in five districts in Texas, providing a total of 33 different test sections for evaluation. Two different scenarios were evaluated: (i) the application of no overlay over the sealed roads, leaving them exposed to both traffic and climate, and (ii) the application of hot mix asphalt or chip seal within the same year the sealant was applied, creating a situation to assess the potential for bleeding of various crack sealants through the overlaying surface material.

40|$|Asphalt rubber {{traditionally}} has been produced with crumb rubber coming from an ambient grinding process and mostly from car tires.

40|$|Interstate 40. The {{purpose of}} the test project was to {{determine}} whether a relatively thin overlay with AR could reduce reflective cracking. Asphalt Rubber is a mixture of 80 % hot paving grade asphalt and 20 % ground tire rubber. This mixture is also commonly referred to as the asphalt rubber wet process or McDonald process. The overlay project was built on top of a very badly cracked concrete pavement, which was in need of reconstruction. The asphalt rubber overlay has performed beyond the original expectation. After nine years of service the overlay is still virtually crack free, with good ride, virtually no rutting or maintenance and good skid resistance. The benefits of using asphalt rubber on this project represents about $ 18 million dollars in construction savings and four years less construction time. Strategic Highway Research Program SPS- 6 test sections built in conjunction with the project further illustrate the very good performance of the asphalt rubber.

The mechanical treatment of tyres is today very interesting, because it is useful in order to obtain crumb rubber aggregate which can be used in road applications such as construction and maintenance of road pavements by means of bituminous mixtures.
