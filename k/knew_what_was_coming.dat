500|$|Before Rolling Thunder {{even began}} the North Vietnamese {{leadership}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> It issued a February 1965 directive {{to the military}} and the population to [...] "maintain communication and transportation and to expect the complete destruction of the entire country, including Hanoi and Haiphong." [...] The communist leadership declared [...] "a people's war against the air war of destruction...each citizen is a soldier, each village, street, and plant a fortress on the anti-American battlefront." [...] All except those deemed [...] "truly indispensable {{to the life of the}} capital" [...] were evacuated to the countryside. By 1967, Hanoi's population had been reduced by half.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Journalist Joshua Prager {{published}} {{that the}} Giants secretly learned opponents' finger signals, when several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on July 20, 1951, the team used a telescope and buzzer wire {{to steal the}} finger signals of opposing catchers careless enough to leave their signs unprotected. Giants catcher Sal Yvars told Prager that he relayed to Thomson the stolen sign for Branca's fastball. Thomson always insisted {{that he had no}} foreknowledge of Branca's pitch. Branca had been aware of the rumors and was skeptical of Thomson's denial, but later told The New York Times in 2001, [...] "I didn't want to diminish a legendary moment in baseball. And even if Bobby <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> he had to hit it.... Knowing the pitch doesn't always help." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Trevor {{regarded}} me wickedly, and I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|E
60|$|Arthur wrung my hand. He was {{apparently}} much relieved, {{and he did}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He didn't {{recognize}} me or <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> till Silvermane <b>was</b> on him. But he was quick, and fell sidewise. Silvermane's knee sent him sprawling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Elphinspoon," [...] he said, [...] "I think I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming.</b> Will {{you wait}} for me here? I shall be back in half an hour." ...|$|R
60|$|Bostil <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> and {{prepared}} himself. Rapid footsteps sounded without.|$|E
60|$|The boy <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and {{immediately}} {{stood up on}} the limb.|$|E
60|$|Now I let {{my hands}} fall {{and stared at}} him, for well I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no! I hope not; but if I had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> I don't think I {{should have}} asked you to consent to Vera and Thekla's {{spending}} their holidays at Mr. Waring's country house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Freezing, and grumbling!" [...] said Allonby. [...] "They've made {{up their}} minds to get Larry this time or we wouldn't have kept them here. It's the horses I'm anxious about. They seem to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming,</b> and they're going to give us trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} the servant brought word to Rupert, that Mistress Holliday wished {{to speak to him}} in her room. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> Rupert went with slow steps and a heavy heart to the little drawing room which was known as madam's room.|$|R
60|$|His son looked up, {{but said}} nothing. Again he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> {{and it was}} worse than {{anything}} that had gone before.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> While {{she felt}} {{that it would be}} better to meet the {{situation}} frankly, she nevertheless shrank from doing so.|$|E
60|$|They both turned quickly towards him. The Inspector {{smiled in}} a {{confidential}} manner at Laura. It {{was obvious that}} he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Her {{professional}} boxing {{career began}} on 2 November 1996 {{with her first}} world title try, as she went right away and challenged Halmich for the WIBF's world Flyweight title, losing by a second-round knockout. She did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> towards her. She had never fought competition on this level.|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA. I {{have only}} this to say. You dragged {{me down to}} your level for a moment this afternoon. Do you think, if that had ever {{happened}} before, that I {{should not have been}} on my guard---that I should not have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and <b>known</b> my own miserable weakness? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was behind}} the banks--the banks of cloud, you know," [...] he went on, a little wistfully. [...] "I {{think that that was}} one of the few moments in my life when I peered out of my prison-house. I must have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> I must have remembered afterwards--for I came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Whittle turned, and {{ran back}} a few steps. [...] "Yes, sir," [...] he said, in breathless deprecation, as if he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> next.|$|E
60|$|The excited boy obeyed, and Dumps, leaping {{on another}} chair beside him, {{sat down to}} listen, with ears erect, as if he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Benicia <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> but she smiled. [...] "You {{are sure}} of that?" [...] she said. [...] "I mean, {{you still think}} it is your business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A pack-horse {{knows his}} place in the row. He's a {{creature}} of habit and hates to see another animal where he ought to be, but Bill was late in loading up and we didn't stop for him. If I'd <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> to me, I'd have waited. Now you have got the thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, can she {{scramble}} up the laurels? Yes, {{she hopes}} so; though {{she wished she}} had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> for she would have changed her Sunday muslin. But a look of anxiety came on Sam's face as he peeped into the clump of laurels; he signed back the others, sprang upon the dark scraggy bough of the tree, and Hal called out, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} how glad I am, Lady Chiltern. We were afraid that Chiltern would have thrown it up, and then I don't know where we should have been. England {{would not have been}} England any longer, to my thinking, if we hadn't won the day. It'd have been just like a French revolution. Nobody would have <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> or where he was going." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> but was ready, {{and felt}} a tragic sort of {{satisfaction}} in the thought of all she was relinquishing for love of David.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Cap, what's eatin' you?" [...] asked Arthurs. He looked dumfounded. Ken hung to him desperately; {{he thought}} he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> There were hurried {{footsteps}} in the corridor and excited voices.|$|E
6000|$|... (But {{she does}} not wonder very much. She would wonder more if she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> Her book slips unregarded to the floor. The ladies are at rest until {{it is time to}} dress.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, if {{you look}} forward, you will not see a step before you, and be certain to go wrong; but, {{if you look}} behind you, and watch {{carefully}} whatever you have passed, and especially {{keep your eye on}} the dog, who goes by instinct, and therefore can't go wrong, then you will <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> next, as plainly as if you saw it in a looking-glass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha!' soliloquized Charles, 'I've done it! I could fancy his wrath {{something}} terrific when it {{was once}} well up. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> next; but I believe he has got himself pretty well in hand. It is playing with edge tools; and now I have been favoured with one flash of the Morville eye, I'll let him alone; but it ryled me {{to be treated as}} something beneath his anger, like a woman or a child.' ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{he spoke}} this, Mr. Brough burst into tears; and we who didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> {{looked at each}} other as pale as parsnips: all except Swinney, who was twelfth clerk, and made believe to whistle. When Mr. B. had wiped his eyes and {{recovered}} himself, he turned round; and oh, how my heart thumped as he looked me full in the face! How it was relieved, though, when he shouted out in a thundering voice-- ...|$|R
60|$|One {{glance at}} Mrs. Neville's tear-stained face {{was enough for}} her. She <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming,</b> and clasped {{at one of the}} young blue gum trees that grew along the path to prevent herself from falling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not this Saturday. We <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> You see, if we {{pull through}} the {{inspection}} we may move up one {{place on the}} roster for foreign service.... You'd better stand back. We're going to pillow-fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must," [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "I have work before me. Good-by, Francis! Somehow I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> I believe that I am glad, dear, but I must think about it, and so must you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some of the work-folk <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> this way. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> for,--I {{promised to}} let them look at the comet through the glass.' ...|$|R
50|$|Life is brutal, but Hannah tells {{fairy tales}} and stories {{to the women}} in her bunk to keep their spirits up, and she insists that she <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> because of her history classes in school, but no one will believe her. Tensions rise when a family is {{revealed}} to have typhus and when a woman goes into labor, {{some of the men}} attempt an escape when they find a guard they think they can trust, only to be caught and executed.|$|R
5000|$|Jordan has {{suggested}} {{that many of the}} rows featured on-screen between Alfie and his love-interest Kat were word-for-word arguments he had with his wife, Tracy. He commented, [...] "Wed be watching EastEnders at home, then an Alfie and Kat scene would start and Id think, Oh shit, because Id <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> And then wed have another row about how I dont argue properly because when we do argue Im just making mental notes for stuff to write the next day." ...|$|R
