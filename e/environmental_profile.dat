5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes.

5|$|Turbulent {{forces in}} {{air and water}} affect the {{environment}} and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems. For example, wind running {{over the surface of}} a lake creates turbulence, mixing the water column and influencing the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> to create thermally layered zones, affecting how fish, algae, {{and other parts of the}} aquatic ecosystem are structured. Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals. Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation. This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems (e.g., of the Columbia Basin in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.|$|E

This study presents the compared <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of the two}} sprout inhibitors available on the Dutch market: A traditional chemical product with isopropyl- 3 -chlorophenylcarbamate (CIPC) and isopropyl-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and a new agrification product with S-(+) -carvone derived from caraway seed (Carum carvi), examining the common idea that natural products are less harmful to the environment than chemical products. Nine environmental effect scores are evaluated based on emissions and energy use during the entire life cycle (life cycle analysis, LCA). A substantial difference {{is found in the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> of the two sprout inhibitors. In seven environmental effects (C) IPC scores better than carvone.

First Solar established the first global and comprehensive recycling program in the PV industry in 2005. Its recycling facilities operate at each of First Solar’s manufacturing plants and recover up to 95% of semiconductor material for reuse in new modules and 90% of glass for reuse in new glass products. A life cycle assessment of CdTe module recycling by the University of Stuttgart showed a reduction in primary energy demand in End-Of-Life from 81 MJ/m2 to -12 MJ/m2, a reduction of around 93 MJ/m2, {{and in terms of}} global warming potential from 6 kg CO2-equiv./m2 to -2.5 CO2-equiv./m2, a reduction of around -8.5 CO2-equiv./m2. These reductions show a highly beneficial change in the overall <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of CdTe photovoltaic module. The LCA also showed that the main contributors to considered environmental impact categories are due to required chemicals and energy within the processing of CdTe modules.|$|E
40|$|Species {{distribution}} models (SDMs) are {{an important}} tool in biogeography and phylogeography studies, that most often require explicit absence information to adequately model the environmental space on which species can potentially inhabit. In the so called background pseudoabsences approach, absence locations are simulated {{in order to obtain}} a complete sample of the environment. Whilst the commonest approach is random sampling of the entire study region, in its multiple variants, its performance may not be optimal, and the method of generation of pseudoabsences is known to have a significant influence on the results obtained. Here, we compare a suite of classic (random sampling) and novel methods for pseudo-absence data generation and propose a generalizable three-step method combining <b>environmental</b> <b>profiling</b> with a new technique for background extent restriction. To this aim, we consider 11 phylogenetic groups of Oak (Quercus sp.) described in Europe. We evaluate the influence of different pseudo-absence types on model performance (area under the ROC curve), calibration (reliability diagrams) and the resulting suitability maps, using a cross-validation approach. Regardless of the modelling algorithm used, randomsampling models were outperformed by the methods that incorporate <b>environmental</b> <b>profiling</b> of the background, stressing the importance of the pseudo-absence generation techniques for the development of accurate and reliable SDMs. We also provide an integrated modelling framework implementing the methods tested in a software package for the open source R environment...|$|R

50|$|A 2002 {{case study}} {{comparing}} energy use, {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and costs for roof beams found {{it takes two to}} three times more energy and six to twelve times more fossil fuels to manufacture steel beams than it does to manufacture glulam beams.

If they are burned {{at the end of their}} service life, more energy can be recovered than was used to manufacture them. If they are landfilled, the glulam beams are a worse alternative than steel because of the methane emission. A more recent study by Chalmers University of Technology was not so optimistic. Nevertheless, it showed that while the absolute greenhouse emissions are strongly dependent on the method used to calculate them, the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of glulam is typically as good or better than steel in an example structural application.The cost of the glulam beams is slightly lower than the steel beams.|$|E

'Cradle-to-grave' (or 'well-to-wheel') {{analyses were performed}} using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach with the aims of identifying the key drivers of environmental impact in the bioethanol supply chains and of comparing the environmental footprints of various bioethanol supply chains with those of conventional petrol. Base cases (bioethanol production from various waste papers) and two state-of-the-art cases including pre-treatment of office paper by dilute acid (DA) and of newspaper by an oxidative lime (OL) process were constructed using laboratory data, expert consultations, literature values, and simulation in AspenPlus™ software. Contribution analysis showed enzyme production needed for hydrolysis of the papers {{to be the main}} contributor to the <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> for bioethanol in the base cases. The {{production of}} process heat and hydrochloric acid respectively were the main contributors to the bioethanol <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> for office paper-to-bioethanol with DA pre-treatment and newspaper-to-bioethanol with OL pre-treatment. Overall, bioethanol produced from newspaper, magazine paper and cardboard was found to have a lower environmental impact than the conventional transport fuel petrol. However, this conclusion is significantly affected by the system boundaries used for the analysis. When an expanded system boundary is applied to consider virgin and recycled paper production as the potential consequential effects within the bioethanol and petrol systems respectively, office paper-derived bioethanol systems emerge as the most environmentally favourable over petrol. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012...|$|R
