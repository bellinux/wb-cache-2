5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in Northwestern Ontario, Phillips moved east to Montreal in September 1902 to study {{electrical}} engineering at McGill University. He joined the university's hockey team, which had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> a new Canadian university league, and was immediately named captain. Phillips only played one match for McGill, on January 23, 1903 against Queen's University; McGill lost 7–0. Days after the game the Montreal Hockey Club asked Phillips to join them for their Stanley Cup challenge series against the Winnipeg Victorias. This required the approval of the other university clubs, which agreed on the condition that Phillips end his McGill career, which he did. Montreal won the series, with Phillips finishing third on the team in scoring with six goals in four games. Phillips also earned praise for his defensive efforts, in particular his ability to stop Tony Gingras.|$|E

When Philippe moved to Switzerland, Bozon followed, and was a player for the junior clubs of Genève-Servette HC, the Kloten Flyers and HC Lugano. At age 15 Bozon decided he wanted to follow the path of Nino Niederreiter, a fellow Swiss junior player who had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> North America at age 17 and joined a team in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) to further his career. Bozon wanted to {{eventually}} play in the National Hockey League and realized there were more scouts following teams in the CHL, which oversees three major junior hockey leagues in Canada and the United States. He had preferred to play for a team in the Ontario Hockey League, but was instead selected by the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League, twenty-seventh overall at the 2011 CHL Import Draft. He joined the Blazers for the 2011–12 season and played 71 games for them, recording 36 goals and 35 assists for 71 points. His goal total was the most among all WHL rookies, his points second among rookies and third overall on the Blazers. Bozon was recognised for his efforts by being named the WHL's Western Conference nominee for the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie-of-the-year. He also was a co-recipient of the Blazers rookie-of-the-year award, sharing it with goaltender Cole Cheveldave.|$|E

Jones put out a call for two more girls to join her in this trio. Her request was eventually answered by Tionne Watkins, a native of Des Moines, Iowa, who had moved to Atlanta with her family at a young age, and Lisa Lopes, a rapper who had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> the city from her native Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a small keyboard and $750 ($ today).

25|$|After {{completing}} his first degree, Mbeki planned to join uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and he sought {{permission to do}} so, but this plan was vetoed by Tambo, who advised him to do a Master's degree. In October 1965, Mbeki returned to Sussex for one year to do his Masters in Economics and Development. Mbeki at this time shared a flat with Peter Lawrence and Ingram, situated at 3 Sillwood Street. While in England, Mbeki supported the Labour Party, then-led by Harold Wilson. Mbeki was intensely critical of the New Left revision of Marxism that swept Europe {{in the latter half}} of the 1960s and remained ardently loyal to the Soviet Union, which at the time heavily sponsored the ANC's underground movement, providing them with financial and educational support, as well as arms and military training. On 18 May 1966, Mbeki organised a 24-hour vigil at the Clock Tower in Brighton's central square against Ian Smith's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia. In October 1966 Mbeki moved to London to work for the ANC full-time. During this period he met his wife to be, Zanele Dlamini, a social worker from Alexandra Township in Johannesburg, who was also studying in London.

The protagonist of Pokémon X and Y is a young teenager who had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> a small town called Vaniville Town with their mother. They soon befriend four trainers—Shauna, Tierno, Trevor, and their rival Calem or Serena,—all of whom were called to meet Professor Sycamore who is the leading professor in the Kalos Region in Lumiose City, the main city of Kalos. Receiving either Chespin, Fennekin, or Froakie as their starter Pokémon from Tierno, the player then sets out on their adventure. Along the way, they learn of Pokémon Gyms and receive their first badge for defeating Viola, the Gym Leader in Santalune City. Thereafter, they encounter Sina and Dexio, assistants of Sycamore, who brings them to the professor himself; however, once in Lumiose City they discover the area to be suffering from a partial power outage.

The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels."
