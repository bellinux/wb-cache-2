25|$|The {{condenser}} condenses {{the steam}} from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid {{to allow it}} to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> is reduced and efficiency of the cycle increases.|$|E
50|$|Topping cycle plants {{primarily}} produce {{electricity from}} a <b>steam</b> turbine. The <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> is then condensed {{and the low}} temperature heat released from this condensation is utilized for e.g. district heating or water desalination.|$|R
50|$|Condensing {{turbines}} {{are most}} {{commonly found in}} electrical power plants. These turbines receive steam from a boiler and exhaust it to a condenser. The <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> is at a pressure well below atmospheric, and is in a partially condensed state, typically of a quality near 90%.|$|R
2500|$|Steam {{locomotives}} consume {{vast quantities}} of water because they operate on an open cycle, expelling their steam immediately after a single use rather than recycling it in a closed loop as stationary and marine steam engines do. Water was a constant logistical problem, and condensing engines were devised for use in desert areas. These engines had huge radiators in their tenders and instead of <b>exhausting</b> <b>steam</b> out of the funnel it was captured, passed back to the tender and condensed. The cylinder lubricating oil {{was removed from the}} <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> to avoid a phenomenon known as priming, a condition caused by foaming in the boiler which would allow water to be carried into the cylinders causing damage because of its incompressibility. The most notable engines employing condensers (Class 25, the [...] "puffers which never puff") worked across the Karoo desert of South Africa from the 1950s until the 1980s.|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} {{differences between}} stages include that between warm surface water and working steam, that between <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> and cooling water, and that between cooling water reaching the condenser and deep water. These represent external irreversibilities that reduce the overall temperature difference.|$|E
25|$|In {{the nuclear}} power plants called {{pressurized}} water reactors, special large heat exchangers pass heat from the primary (reactor plant) system to the secondary (steam plant) system, producing steam from water in the process. These are called steam generators. All fossil-fueled and nuclear power plants using steam-driven turbines have surface condensers to convert the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> from the turbines into condensate (water) for re-use.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{condenser}} is a {{shell and tube}} heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|E
5000|$|A {{locomotive}} boiler {{has three}} main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical [...] "boiler barrel" [...] containing {{a large number}} of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. The boiler barrel contains larger flue-tubes to carry the superheater elements, where present. Forced draught is provided in the locomotive boiler by injecting <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> back into the exhaust via a blast pipe in the smokebox.|$|R

25|$|The Meyer {{design was}} {{modified}} {{by moving the}} rear power unit further back and allowed the firebox to be between the two power units (as in a Garratt), thus allowing a larger firebox. The length of engine was increased, with the extra length behind the cab being used for additional water tanks. Some designs had an auxiliary chimney at the rear to avoid {{the need for an}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> pipe running the length of the engine.|$|E
25|$|A Wilkinson engine weighed about eleven tons, carried 160 {{gallons of}} water and had a bunker capable of {{carrying}} nine cubic feet of coke. It was a vertical engine with a vertical boiler. The cylinders were of small bore and acted upon a crankshaft through which motion was communicated to the four coupled wheels by cog-wheel gears. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> was not condensed but was superheated in a patent contrivance in the firebox whence it escaped to the atmosphere through the chimney.|$|E
25|$|The eleven {{locomotives}} in {{the class}} had condensing apparatus that fed the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> {{back into the water}} tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened {{to make room for the}} external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the cab to increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler feedwater pump because standard injectors will not work with hot water. The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.|$|E
40|$|Expanded {{technologies}} on Long-Range PIV {{by using}} a CCD camera with the long-focus optical system enabled us to measure the velocity field hardly accessible as {{the top of the}} soaring chimney at fossil-fired power plants. Field application development for such sophisticated technologies as Super-Long-Range PIV will be utilized for managing operation and considering effects on the environment in the power plants. It has the possibility effective in grasping the surrounding environment as large-scale phenomena for a power plant, and furthermore grasping the influence of the natural disaster on the environment such as a volcanic eruption. The present work carried out the measurement of velocity field using Super-Long-Range PIV system, where the <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> flow, lit up by the daylight, {{from the top of the}} chimney at the fossil-fired power plant in operation located in distance of ~ 7. 8 km far from the measuring point, was shot to the CCD camera to detect the flow velocity by cross correlation process of the image data. The schematic diagram outlines of the system are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The visualized fluid velocity field by the natural daylight beam in Fig. 2 was magnified by the long-focus optical system and recorded into the CCD camera system. The degree of the image-field distortion, which is one of Seidelâ€™s classifications of five aberrations, was examined, taken by the CCD camera through the telescope.

50|$|Near {{the end of}} the 19th century {{compound}} engines {{came into}} widespread use. Compound engines <b>exhausted</b> <b>steam</b> in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried. Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.|$|R
50|$|Solar thermal {{rockets and}} Nuclear thermal rockets {{typically}} propose to use liquid hydrogen for an Isp (Specific Impulse) of around 600-900 seconds, {{or in some}} cases water that is <b>exhausted</b> as <b>steam</b> for an Isp of about 190 seconds.|$|R
25|$|At {{the front}} of the boiler is the smokebox, into which used <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> is {{injected}} to increase the draught of smoke and combustion gases through the fire tubes in the boiler and out through the chimney. The search for thermal efficiency greater than that of the typical fire-tube boiler led such engineers as Nigel Gresley to consider innovations such as the water-tube boiler. Although he tested the concept on the LNER Class W1, the difficulties during development exceeded the will to solve the efficiency problem at the time.|$|E
25|$|Number 92250 was {{equipped}} with a Giesl ejector in which the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> was divided between seven nozzles arranged in a row on the locomotive's longitudinal axis and directed into a narrow fan-shaped ejector that more intimately mixed it with the smokebox gases than {{is the case of}} an ordinary chimney. This offered the same level of draught for a reduced level of exhaust back-pressure or, alternatively, increased draught with no performance loss elsewhere. Again, great claims were made as to the potential benefits, and 92250 retained the variant chimney until withdrawal, though no benefit was noticeable.|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{cold water}} into a boiler reduces power, and from the 1920s a variety of heaters were incorporated. The most common type for {{locomotives}} was the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> feedwater heater that piped some of the exhaust through small tanks mounted {{on top of the}} boiler or smokebox or into the tender tank; the warm water then had to be delivered to the boiler by a small auxiliary steam pump. The rare economiser type differed in that it extracted residual heat from the exhaust gases. An example of this is the pre-heater drum(s) found on the Franco-Crosti boiler.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "locomotive breath" [...] {{refers to}} the <b>steam</b> <b>exhaust</b> from a <b>steam</b> locomotive. The song's lyrics use the imagery of an {{impending}} and unavoidable train wreck as an allegorical portrayal of a man's life falling apart - or even death itself, as Ian Anderson has put it. Despite this, elements of humour are present, as Anderson often includes in his lyrics. The lyrics borrow heavily from Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt's surrealistic short story The Tunnel.|$|R
25|$|Before {{widespread}} {{power distribution}} from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings {{had their own}} power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> {{could be used for}} building and industrial process heat, which today is known as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self-generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. Cogeneration is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called microgeneration.|$|E
25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught â€“ where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's line of vision.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the thermal shock that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has {{adjusted}} the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and <b>exhaust</b> of <b>steam.</b> The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
50|$|In practice, a <b>steam</b> engine <b>exhausting</b> the <b>steam</b> to {{atmosphere}} will {{typically have}} an efficiency (including the boiler) {{in the range}} of 1-10%, but {{with the addition of a}} condenser and multiple expansion, and high steam pressure/temperature, it may be greatly improved, historically into the regime of 10-20%, and very rarely slightly higher.|$|R
50|$|In a steam locomotive, {{draft is}} {{produced}} in the firebox by <b>exhausting</b> the <b>steam</b> coming from the cylinders out of the chimney, or also by a blower. The Lempor ejector ejects differently from the conventional blastpipe; as one cylinder ejects it creates a vacuum in the other cylinder, thereby requiring less power to drive the piston.|$|R
25|$|Because it is {{situated}} in a fairly rural area, the UConn campus at Storrs has facilities that {{allow it to be}} virtually self-sufficient. All heat on campus is steam, and where possible sidewalks were laid over the underground connectors to keep the snow off. In 2005, a cogeneration plant was activated, which generates most of the electricity for the campus, and uses the <b>exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> for the campus central heating system. The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support {{of a growing number of}} industry leaders based in Connecticut, UConn is at the forefront of developing clean, alternative sources of renewable energy using fuel cell technology. In April 2012, UConn commissioned a fuel cell power plant at its Depot Campus that will supply the campus with clean and efficiency energy, cooling and heating. The installation of a ClearEdge Power, former UTC Power, PureCell System is the latest step by UConn to reduce its carbon footprint and build a sustainable community. The fuel cell installation was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticutâ€™s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{problems}} with smoke and steam overwhelming staff and {{passengers on the}} covered sections of the Metropolitan Railway, Fowler proposed a fireless locomotive. The locomotive was built by Robert Stephenson and Company and was a broad gauge 2-4-0 tender engine. The boiler had a normal firebox connected to a large combustion chamber containing fire bricks which were {{to act as a}} heat reservoir. The combustion chamber was linked to the smokebox through a set of very short firetubes. [...] <b>Exhaust</b> <b>steam</b> was re-condensed instead of escaping and fed back to the boiler. The locomotive was intended to operate conventionally in the open, but in tunnels dampers would be closed and steam would be generated using the stored heat from the fire bricks.|$|E

50|$|A Kylpor ejector {{is a type}} of <b>steam</b> {{locomotive}} <b>exhaust</b> system {{developed by}} noted Argentine locomotive engineer Livio Dante Porta. In a steam locomotive, draft is produced in the firebox by <b>exhausting</b> the <b>steam</b> coming from the cylinders out the chimney. The Kylpor exhaust delivers improved draughting capacity over traditional exhaust systems, and is a later development of the Kylchap exhaust.|$|R
5000|$|The {{importance}} of raising steam under pressure (from a thermodynamic standpoint) {{is that it}} attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus {{became the basis for}} most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, [...] "high pressure" [...] amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the <b>exhausting</b> <b>steam</b> into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.|$|R
