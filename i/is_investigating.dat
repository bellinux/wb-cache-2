40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} the DFT methods and basis sets on harmine {{molecule}} has <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> 26 DFT methods with 6 basis sets were used. Two main comparison chosen DFT methods in this work has <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> It <b>is</b> concluded that this contribution is very important and cannot be neglected. In the following analysis, changes in energy levels <b>were</b> <b>investigated</b> by two different methods. Considering a specific basis set, changes in energy levels were obtained using different DFT methods. A specific DFT method is chosen and changes in energy levels have <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> by means of various basis sets.

5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he <b>is</b> <b>investigating</b> the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E
