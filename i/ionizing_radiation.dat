40|$|International audienceBackground: Production of {{high levels}} of IL- 6 is often {{correlated}} with resistance to cytotoxics or <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations,</b> in cancer cell lines as in various cancer patients. We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against IL- 6 may enable to reverse resistance of cancer cell lines. Methodology/Principal Findings: We exposed ten haematological cancer cells from lymphoma, myeloma or leukemia origins to cytotoxics or <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations</b> and assessed the effects of anti-IL- 6 antibody addition on cell proliferation, apoptosis or IL- 6 signaling. A strong correlation between IL- 6 secretion, measured by ELISA, and resistance to doxorubicin as <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations</b> was observed in the multiple myeloma U 266 and the Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi and Namalwa cells. Although an anti-IL- 6 antibody combined to both treatments efficiently blocked IL- 6 signaling in U 266 cells, expressing the IL- 6 receptor gp 80, it did not increase treatment-induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on these cells, {{as well as on}} Daudi and Namalwa cells. This lack of effect could be related to diverse factors: 1) a higher release of the soluble form of IL- 6 receptor gp 80 in response to doxorubicin and irradiation from all cell lines, 2) an impaired level of the IL- 6 pathway inhibitor SOCS 3 in Daudi cells, and 3) an increased release of IL- 10 and TNFα, two cytokines involved in cell radio- and chemoresistance. Conclusions/significance: These data support the fact that IL- 6 is not the preponderant actor of cell resistance to cytotoxics and <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations,</b> which seems to be regulated by a complex network of proteins...|$|R

40|$|It is {{represented}} the review {{about the effect}} of low doses of <b>ionized</b> <b>radiation</b> on different types of bio-logical objects (Japanese quail embryos, Aspergillus niger, Spirostomum ambiguum Ehrbg., mezenchim stem cells of mice bone brain, dry seeds of the highest plants, blood lymphocytes of pilots and cosmonauts) and water medium. In model experiments under the chronic <b>ionized</b> <b>radiation</b> in doses comparable with the doses of <b>ionized</b> <b>radiation</b> inside the orbital space stations and during the flight in interplanetary space was shown alike with morphological deviations (Japa-nese quail embryos, Aspergillus niger), the phenome-non of radiation hormezis (Aspergillus niger, mezen-chim stem cells), the increasing of the germination of seeds, the decreasing of spontaneous motion activity of spirostoms and DNA damage, chromosome aberra-tions and the increased radio-sensitivity to adding ra-diation load in blood lymphocytes. These data testi-fied the fact that the definite factor of ionized radia-tion effect is the changing of water medium state. Thus under the interplanetary cosmic flight and long stay on the orbit in the region of magnetosphere the studying kinds of radiation first effected on the water medium of organism as a result morpho-functional structures were changed...|$|R
5|$|The extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans has a {{remarkable}} {{ability to survive}} DNA damage from <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent homologous recombination.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiation</b> can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma.

The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin.

40|$|The X-ray mapping {{procedure}} of Manney and Mortimer (1964) {{is the most}} widely applicable and convenient method for fine structure analysis in yeast, but suffers the disadvantage that suitable X-ray machines or gamma ray sources are very expensive. Although many other recombinogens are known, none gives a linear dose-response like X-rays and few are as convenient or give as reproducible results. Experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported in this paper show, however, that the near-ultraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent sunlamps gives linear dose-response relations, as reproducible results as <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations,</b> and map distances which correlate highly with those obtained by using 60 Co gamma rays. It is suggested that this convenient recombinogen may be a suitable low-cost substitute for <b>ionizing</b> <b>radiations</b> in fine structure mapping...|$|R
