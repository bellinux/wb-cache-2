5|$|During {{practice}} {{before the}} game, California kicker Tyler Fredrickson practiced <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball high to avoid {{what was expected}} to be a difficult Virginia Tech kick-blocking attack. During the regular season, Fredrickson had five kicks blocked and successfully converted just 14 of 29field goal attempts. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, blocked 102kicks in the 200games previous to the Insight Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Running back Cedric Humes {{was named}} the game's most {{valuable}} player for Virginia Tech, and quarterback Hunter Cantwell {{was named the}} Cardinals' most valuable player. Tech punter Nic Schmitt set Gator Bowl record for punt yardage and average punt distance, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball six times for 300yards, an average of 50yards per kick.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} as Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' special teams (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer at his own game) that earned them the victory. Kansas blocked one Virginia Tech field goal, and caused Tech kicker Jud Dunlevy to miss another short. Kansas punter Kyle Tucker {{did an excellent job}} pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt. His longest punt, a 62-yard kick, was one of three punts that were downed inside Tech's 20-yard line.|$|E

Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse to try to take miles off the odometer without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was a key {{component}} of the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83field goal attempts, including 33 of his previous 38kicks of less than 50yards. Janikowski also handled kickoffs, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E
25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of <b>kicks</b> used; <b>the</b> punt, drop <b>kick</b> and place <b>kick.</b> To punt <b>the</b> ball <b>the</b> player must <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball before it touches the ground. A drop <b>kick</b> occurs if <b>the</b> ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|R

His first goal of the season came after being assisted by Simon Rusk in a 2–2 away draw with Northwich Victoria. After coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute, he was sent off in the 76th minute of a 3–1 away defeat against Wrexham on 7 October 2008, after initially being shown a yellow card for <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball away and then receiving a second card for a tackle on Carl Tremarco, which resulted in him being suspended for York's match against Woking.|$|E
5|$|Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech {{attempted}} to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown {{with one of}} its own. Kendrick fielded the ball at the Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, {{all the way to}} the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run the ball for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|In Cleveland, the Bears started strong after Demontre Hurst intercepted Brian Hoyer's pass, {{which led}} to Robbie Gould's field goal, {{followed}} by Jordan Palmer's touchdown pass to Joseph Anderson, which Cleveland retaliated with James Michael-Johnson intercepting Trent Edwards and scoring. Late in the game, the Bears led 16–9, and Sherrick McManis intercepted Hoyer, who made up for the pick by throwing a touchdown pass to Dan Gronkowski. Later, Armonty Bryant forced Harvey Unga to fumble, which was recovered by Cleveland's L. J. Foyt, {{which led to}} Spencer Lanning <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> go-ahead field goal to put the Browns up 18–16. With {{a little over a}} minute left in the game, Gould missed a 57-yarder wide left, giving Cleveland the win.|$|E

5|$|In Small Heath's {{last game}} in October, {{at home to}} Darwen, a 3–2 victory was marred by a serious injury to full-back Fred Speller. Soon after kickoff. Speller was {{in the act of}} <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball when the onrushing William Campbell {{collided}} with him, knocking him to the ground. A police constable administered first aid before the player, whose leg was broken, was carried from the field on a plank and taken to hospital. On a heavy pitch in poor condition, it was nearly impossible to dribble the ball, and Small Heath's decision to play on with only one back meant Darwen's attackers were frequently caught offside.|$|E
5|$|The first intercollegiate {{football}} {{game was played}} on November 6, 1869, between the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, then known as the Rutgers Queensmen, and the New Jersey Tigers, now the Princeton Tigers. The game {{was a mixture of}} rugby and soccer, with teams scoring by <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball into the opponent's net. The game slowly developed, with many new and safer rules being added during the early 1870s. The number of schools participating in the sport also grew. However, even with the expansion, Princeton dominated the game, being declared the champion eight times in ten years. Yale was the only team which came close to Princeton, being awarded four championship designations during the same period.|$|E

5|$|According to biographer C. Douglas Kroll, {{the first}} {{evidence}} of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857, but the school's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward. However, {{it is widely believed}} by football researchers that the playing of intercollegiate football began in November 1869, when a player at Rutgers University challenged another player at the nearby College of New Jersey (now Princeton). The contest more closely resembled soccer, with teams scoring by <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball into the opponent's net, and lacked a uniform rules structure. The game developed slowly; the first rules were drafted in October 1873, and only consisted of twelve guidelines. Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased, the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey, who claimed eight national championships in ten years. Only Yale presented any form of challenge, claiming four national championships in the same time period.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple.

5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 2003 Insight Bowl, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the offensive player of the game. Rodgers completed 27 of his 35 passes for 394yards and two touchdowns in the winning effort. Rodgers' performance tied Cal's bowl records for most completions, most touchdowns, and most rushing touchdowns, and was the third-highest offensive output by a single player in California history. The victory was California's first bowl win since a victory over Iowa in the 1993 Alamo Bowl. California kicker Tyler Fredrickson's game-winning score was his only field goal kick during the game, {{but he also had}} seven extra-point kicks for seven points. In addition, he served as California's punter, <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball 4 times for 159total punting yards. He set school records for most extra points in a season and most extra points attempted. Virginia Tech kicker Carter Warley missed three field goals: a 40-yarder, 45-yarder, and a 28-yarder. He successfully kicked four extra points for four points. Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall finished the game having completed 24 of his 34 pass attempts for 398yards and four touchdowns.|$|E
