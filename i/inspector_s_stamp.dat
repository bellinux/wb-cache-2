50|$|It was {{not only}} in design and {{commemorative}} purpose that this issue proved a watershed in U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamp</b> history. The Columbians, like all previous U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamps,</b> had been produced by private security printers on limited-term contracts periodically presented for bidding. They proved, however, {{to be the last}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamps</b> printed by a private company for many years. For during early 1894, the American Bank Note Company failed to secure a renewal of its stamp contract because the U. S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing submitted a lower bid; and the Bureau then enjoyed a monopoly on U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamp</b> production for decades thereafter. Not until 1944 would a private company again produce U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamps</b> (the Overrun Countries series, which required special multicolor printing) and the Bureau subsequently resumed its exclusive role in production, only gradually relinquishing it over the next sixty years (U. <b>S.</b> <b>stamp</b> operations at the Bureau ceased entirely during 2005). Scholars believe that the Bureau's first task during 1894 was to finish some Columbian sheets printed by American Banknote; what makes this theory plausible is that, while many Columbian stamps are perfectly perforated, others are distinctly substandard in this regard, with partially punched chads and/or holes that are missing, ragged or misplaced-- flaws that would also mar the stamps of the first Bureau definitive issue, released later during 1894.|$|R

40|$|Solid state superionic <b>stamping</b> (<b>S</b> 4) is a non-photolithographic {{process for}} etching {{features}} into thin metal films which {{has shown the}} capability of reproducing features below 100 nm in recent years. The technique has significant potential because {{in addition to its}} high resolution capability it is both fast and inexpensive. Potential applications for this process include applied plasmonic and surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, as well as a many other devices which this process would allow to be scaled-down economically. Previous generations of stamps for this process were developed primarily to test the fundamental limits of the technique. However, for S 4 to become practically applicable in an industrial setting requires a body of knowledge surrounding stamp fabrication that allows the stamps to be simpler to produce than an alternate method for fabricating S 4 processed substrates. Specifically, <b>S</b> 4 <b>stamp</b> generation has been hindered by the ability to generate extremely high quality surfaces. With that in mind, several methods for working with traditional Ag 2 <b>S</b> <b>stamps</b> were examined. One goal was to produce larger diameter stamps without resorting to extensive waste of Ag 2 S. The ductile nature of the material was exploited to change the geometry of the material to increase the portion of the stamp actively participating in etching metal. These larger diameter films were also exploited in an attempt to produce sputtering targets in the hope of generating a new method for fabricating high quality stamps. In contrast to work with the previously demonstrated Ag 2 <b>S</b> <b>stamps,</b> alternative materials for S 4 patterning were also examined based on applicability to the S 4 process. A class of silver conducting superionic materials was identified as potentially beneficial for S 4 based on their low melting points and glass transition temperatures. These compounds opened the possibility of a nano-imprint inspired stamp generation process that would scale to significantly larger areas while producing higher quality stamp surfaces. The silver iodide silver metaphosphate glass system was singled out as most promising for <b>S</b> 4 <b>stamps.</b> This material was synthesized, characterized, and developed into a rudimentary <b>S</b> 4 <b>stamp,</b> where it demonstrated a significant improvement over the previously reported superionic stamp materials. Silver features as small as 30 nm were reproduced from a silicon mold with nanoscale dots. Overall these scalable glass stamps possess similar resolution to previous stamps, while being facile to fabricate...|$|R
