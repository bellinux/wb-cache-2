40|$|Abstract — Impedance {{modeling}} of aluminum electrolytic capaci-tors presents {{a challenge to}} design engineers, due to the complex nature of the capacitor construction. Unlike an electrostatic capacitor, an electrolytic capacitor behaves like a lossy coaxial distributed RC circuit element whose series and <b>distributed</b> <b>resistances</b> are strong functions of temperature and frequency. This behavior gives rise to values of capacitance, ESR (effective series resistance), and impedance that vary by several orders of magnitude over the typical frequency and temperature range of power inverter applications. Existing public-domain Spice models do not accurately account for this behavior. In this paper, a physics-based approach is used to develop an improved impedance model that is interpreted both in pure Spice circuit models and in math functions. I...|$|R
50|$|Another way {{to explain}} the benefit of Litz {{braiding}} is as follows: the magnetic fields generated by current flowing in the strands are in directions such {{that they have a}} reduced tendency to generate an opposing electromagnetic field in the other strands. Thereby, for the wire as a whole, the skin effect and associated power losses when used in high-frequency applications are reduced. The ratio of distributed inductance to <b>distributed</b> <b>resistance</b> is increased, relative to a solid conductor, resulting in a higher Q factor at these frequencies.|$|E

50|$|Where {{a network}} is {{composed}} of discrete components, analysis using two-port networks {{is a matter of}} choice, not essential. The network can always alternatively be analysed in terms of its individual component transfer functions. However, if a network contains distributed components, such {{as in the case of}} a transmission line, then it is not possible to analyse in terms of individual components since they do not exist. The most common approach to this is to model the line as a two-port network and characterise it using two-port parameters (or something equivalent to them). Another example of this technique is modelling the carriers crossing the base region in a high frequency transistor. The base region has to be modelled as <b>distributed</b> <b>resistance</b> and capacitance rather than lumped components.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{measurements}} of the electrical conductivity in both a 2 D triangular lattice of metallic beads and in a chain of beads. The voltage/current characteristics are qualitatively similar in both experiments. At low applied current, the voltage is found to increase logarithmically in a good agreement with a model of widely <b>distributed</b> <b>resistances</b> in series. At high enough current, the voltage saturates due to the local welding of microcontacts between beads. The frequency dependence of the saturation voltage gives {{an estimate of the}} size of these welded microcontacts. The DC value of the saturation voltage (~ 0. 4 V per contact) gives an indirect measure of the number of welded contact carrying the current within the 2 D lattice. Also, a new measurement technique provides a map of the current paths within the 2 D lattice of beads. For an isotropic compression of the 2 D granular medium, the current paths are localized in few discrete linear paths. This quasi-onedimensional nature of the electrical conductivity thus explains the similarity between the characteristics in the 1 D and 2 D systems.
