5|$|On {{the other}} hand, type of leisure {{activity}} <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> {{influenced by the}} individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Agathaeromys is {{characterized}} {{mainly on the}} basis of features of the molar teeth. As usual in muroid rodents, there are three molars {{on both sides of the}} upper jaw (referred to as M1, M2, and M3 from front to back) and lower jaw (referred to as m1, m2, and m3). Agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines, but differs from other genera in a variety of details of the molar crowns. Agathaeromys donovani (M1 length 2.03–2.84 mm) <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> larger than A.praeuniversitatis (M1 length 1.77–1.94 mm).|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> {{enlarged}} even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E
5|$|If the {{variance}} in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift ({{the variance}} effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection.

5|$|Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b, {{initially}} {{known as}} KOI 7.01, is an extrasolar planet first detected as a transit by the Kepler spacecraft. Its radius and mass {{are similar to}} that of Neptune; however, due to its proximity to its host star, it <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> hotter than any planet in the Solar System. The planet's discovery was announced on January 4, 2010 in Washington, D.C. along with four other planets that were initially detected by the Kepler spacecraft and subsequently confirmed by telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{with the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at a {{wavelength}} of 850μm show an extended flux of radiation {{out to an}} angular radius of 35arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani. The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18arcseconds, which corresponds to a radius of about 60AU. The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35–75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> reduced inside 30AU. This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System's Kuiper belt: a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani. From Earth, this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25° {{to the line of}} sight.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it <b>is</b> <b>substantially</b> related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
30|$|Men {{are more}} likely to be over-skilled than women, whereas gender {{differences}} in under-skilling are minor.

Foreign workers <b>are</b> <b>substantially</b> more likely to <b>be</b> under-skilled and <b>substantially</b> less likely to be over-skilled. Differences emerge also when looking across age groups. Furthermore, we show that skill mismatch is associated with a substantial degree of skill over- and under-utilization, with potential sizeable implications in terms of output loss and workers’ well-being. We also perform a series of reassignment exercises, and we find indications that skill mismatch can <b>be</b> <b>substantially</b> reduced by efficiently reallocating workers to jobs.|$|R
