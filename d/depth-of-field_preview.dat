2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the displayâ€“ for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.|$|E

50|$|Notable {{omissions}} include <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> and {{any form}} of remote shutter release. Both these features {{were included in the}} F65.|$|E
50|$|The Autoreflex A is a stripped-down Autoreflex T without self-timer, mirror lock-up, <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> on/off-switch, {{and battery}} control, and with 1/500 top shutter speed.|$|E
50|$|Its {{features}} included autofocus, {{various forms}} of TTL light metering and different operating modes. It also included <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> and remote shutter release, two facilities notably absent in the F60.|$|E
50|$|The Autoreflex A2 is an {{improved}} Autoreflex A or stripped-down Autoreflex T2 without self-timer, mirror lock-up, <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> on/off-switch, and battery control, and with 1/600 top shutter speed. The engravings still say Autoreflex A.|$|E
50|$|The Autoreflex A1000 is an {{improved}} Autoreflex A2 or stripped-down Autoreflex T2, {{with a top}} shutter speed of 1/1000, but without self-timer, on/off switch, <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> and mirror lock-up. It was sold only in the USA.|$|E
5000|$|The EF also {{featured}} a self-timer and a stop-down metering mode which {{could also be}} used for <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview.</b> Stopped down metering must be used with older Canon FL lenses. The mirror can also be locked up for long exposures, to minimise camera shake.|$|E
50|$|A further {{improvement}} over the ME Super was {{the inclusion of a}} <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> lever. The camera also featured a self-timer, which was electronic rather than the manual lever of its predecessors. The available ISO film speed choices were extended too, and run from 6 to 3200 ASA.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{complete}} lack of automatic functions, but excellent array of manual controls, the MX is often selected as a camera for photography students to practice their technique. The <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> and self-timer functions render the MX superior in this respect to the earlier and cheaper Pentax K1000.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Autoreflex A3" [...] is a stripped-down Autoreflex T3 without self-timer, <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> mirror lock-up, multi-exposure provision, on/off switch, battery control, M flash synch, and hot shoe. It {{replaced}} the A"2" [...] and A1000 as an entry level model, but now {{built on a}} chassis shared with the T3.|$|E
50|$|The SR-T 101 {{was also}} made {{available}} in black. The top cover and the base plate are finished in black enamel while most metal parts are black chromed, {{but the wind}} lever is black anodised. The parts still chromed, to name the most obvious ones, include the shutter-release button, the mirror lock-up knob, the <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> button and the lens-release button.|$|E
50|$|Essentially added a PC flash-sync terminal, ME capability, spot {{metering}} {{and faster}} shutter to the 7000i feature-set. This camera {{was not a}} direct replacement for the earlier 9000, and lacked some features such as <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> but offered some additional features that {{were not on the}} 7000i. This camera was available in white as well, together with matched white 35-105 lens and 5200i flash.|$|E
50|$|The OM Series lenses had the {{aperture}} control ring located {{at the front of}} the lens barrel. This was done to move it away from the shutter speed control, which was a ring on the camera body concentric with the lens mount. OM lenses also featured a <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> button on the lens, in contrast to most other SLR camera systems, in which the button was placed on the camera body.|$|E
50|$|Except {{for having}} an {{enormous}} variety of lenses {{with the popular}} K mount to choose from, the K1000 has fewer features compared to higher-level SLRs of the mid 1970s. The camera has a flash synchronization speed of 1/60th second, a sleeve-bushing equipped shutter and film advance mechanism, no self timer, no <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview,</b> no mirror lockup, no interchangeable focusing screens, no motor drive option, and no autoexposure. The K1000 is a completely manual camera.|$|E
50|$|The EOS 5/A2e {{featured}} eye-controlled focusing, {{which allowed}} {{the user to}} select from one of five focus points by looking at it through the viewfinder as well as activating <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> by looking at a sixth point marked in the top-left corner of the viewfinder. At the time, this feature was unique to Canon. The A2 had the same five focus points, but they could only be selected manually. Although the EOS 5 had an optional vertical grip, the VG-10, the eye-controlled focussing feature only worked when the camera was held in horizontal orientation.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{combination}} of design elements that made the Nikon F successful. It featured interchangeable prisms and focusing screens; the camera had a <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> button; the mirror had lock-up capability; it featured a large bayonet mount and a large lens release button; a single-stroke ratcheted film advance lever; a titanium-foil focal plane shutter; various types of flash synchronization; a rapid rewind lever; a fully removable back. it was a well-made, extremely durable camera, and adhered closely to the then current, successful design scheme of the Nikon rangefinder cameras.|$|E
5000|$|The Autoreflex T3 is an {{improved}} Autoreflex T2, It adds an aperture-stop-down (<b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview)</b> function to the self-timer lever (push lever towards lens for stop-down, push button on lever-hub and turn lever counter-clockwise {{to set the}} self-timer), a Multiple Exposure (M.E.) switch integrated with the shutter-speed dial used {{in combination with the}} cocking-indicator (indicator green means shutter is cocked, red means it isn't), as well as a wider range of selectable film-speeds (ISO 12 - 3200). As with the T2, both the aperture and shutter speed setting are visible in the viewfinder, which has improved brightness compared to earlier models. This model has its serial-number engraved in the top-plate's rear below the wind-lever and a stamped and painted [...] "T-3" [...] between the rewind-lever and prism-bump on the top (note the dash here vs. no dash {{on the front of the}} camera).|$|E

5000|$|Production was short, {{official}} {{reports from}} Nikon claiming only around 100 such cameras made, however its {{likely that the}} real number exceeds that by many hundreds, as serial numbers in the high 800's have been noted [...] Serial numbers on the camera body begin with H9600..., and the front features the signature F3 logo with a H added. Instead of the <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> button, it had an extended version of the button which became an aperture opening button for composing purposes. Metering was done at working aperture, instead of wide-open, as on other F3 bodies. The camera is also unique among all F3's in having a white film take up spool. Like the F3P, the DX-1 viewfinder {{could not be used}} on it. When fitted with the MD-4H it is also incompatible with the Magazine Back MF-4 250, Firing Rate Converter MK-1 and Data Back MF-14.|$|E
5000|$|The H in the F2H of 1978 denoted [...] "High Speed". It was {{yet another}} {{titanium}} armored F2 but {{this time with a}} fixed (not reflex), semi-silvered, pellicle mirror, manual lens diaphragm control and a mechanically matched titanium-armored Nikon MD-100 high speed motor drive. The maximum shutter speed is 1/1000 (vs. 1/2000 for other F2 models). The self-timer and shutter settings 'B' and 'T' were omitted. The <b>depth-of-field</b> <b>preview</b> button was replaced with a 'Full-Aperture Viewing Button'. The Nikon MD-100 motor drive was {{a modified version of the}} MD-2 motor drive and was powered by the Nikon MB-100. The MB-100 consists of two MB-1 battery packs (20 AA or LR6 batteries, or four Nikon MN-1 nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, providing 30 volts), weighing a massive 960 g empty and reaching 10 frames-per-second film advance rate. The F2H set included the Nikon MH-100 battery charger. All components (body, motor and batterypack) may be detached from each other. The bodies (7-digit serial number) and motordrives (6-digit serial number) do not have matching serial numbers, contrary to often repeated misinformation. Body serial numbers began with 7850001, e.g. 'F2 7850001'. Approximately 400 units were produced making the F2H extremely rare, the rarest of any 'production model' F2, and valuable.|$|E
