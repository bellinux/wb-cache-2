5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problem. The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E

The Jags reached the final again nine years later, <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> opposition, but Rangers won 2–1 in a replay {{following}} a 0–0 draw in the first match. In 1935 the Jags won both the Glasgow Cup and the Charity Cup, competitions that were taken seriously at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The tandem seating placed the {{pilot in the}} rear seat, and the gunner in the front seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the gunner <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction as the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the gunner direct viewing from the turret {{by way of a}} periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E

A single-colour cardboard {{model is}} easiest to construct [...] - [...] and some models {{can be made}} by folding a pattern, called a net, from a single sheet of cardboard. Choosing colours requires geometric understanding of the polyhedron. One way is to colour each face differently. A second way is to colour all square <b>faces</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> all pentagonal <b>faces</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and so forth. A third way is to colour opposite <b>faces</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Many polyhedra are also coloured such that no same-coloured faces touch each other along an edge or at a vertex.|$|R

5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E

25|$|A better {{solution}} came {{along in the}} form of the US's AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case, however, the missile in question had a truly long range of just under 2,000km. Considering the distance from London to Moscow is about 2,500km, Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete immunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The counterattacking German were <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{problems}} as the Soviet forces had faced {{in the previous}} month. Advance in difficult terrain overcoming the defensive positions was very slow and casualties were high. Only on September 25, after five days of very heavy fighting, German forces linked up near Gaitolovo, {{and part of the}} Soviet 8th (the 6th Guards Rifle Corps) and 2nd Shock Armies were encircled. After defeating Soviet attempts to relieve or break out of the pocket, it was bombarded by heavy artillery and air strikes. At the same time the 28th Light Infantry and the 12th Panzer divisions defeated the attempts of the Leningrad Front to expand their bridgeheads.|$|E

As the player moves the cursor around the screen it can change into different styles depending on the situation; neutral cursor (no interaction is possible), an arrow (the player can move in the direction indicated), a finger (indicating an item with which the player can directly interact), a wrench (the player must use an inventory item to initiate interaction), a magnifying glass (an area which can be examined in more detail), backwards arrow (the player can move backwards whilst <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction; i.e. {{they do not have}} to turn around).|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 3 March 2004, a Seremban-bound KTM Komuter train in the Seremban Line {{collided}} with the rear of another Komuter train <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> direction, which had been waiting at a signal between Tiroi station and Seremban station for five minutes. Forty were injured, but no deaths were reported. The accident was ascribed to the faulty signal light (struck by lightning) that stopped the earlier train, though {{the driver of the}} rear-ending train is reported to have run a red light into the section occupied by the rear-ended train. The resulting crash disrupted KTM Komuter services along the line for a day. This is so far the worst accident involving the KTM Komuter service.|$|E
25|$|With {{existing}} behavioral, prosthetic, {{and pharmaceutical}} treatments providing limited {{relief from the}} overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> challenges of stuttering. One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success {{in the treatment of}} stuttering. Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative. Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.|$|E
25|$|A private Railway {{operating}} in New Zealand {{at the time}} exclusively purchased Baldwin products after <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> difficulties with British builders the NZR had. The Wellington and Manawatu Railway (1881–1909) operated small fleets of 2-8-0(4), 2-6-2(6), 2-8-2(1), 4-6-0(2) and a large 2-8-4(1) tank locomotive. When the NZR took over the railway, its fleet was absorbed into sub-classes of those operating already in the main fleet. When NZR placed tenders for Diesel locomotives in the 1950s, Baldwins applied but failed when EMD won the contract instead. Surprisingly only one NZR Baldwin product is operational, a class Wd 2-6-4 tank locomotive operating at the Ferrymead railway in Christchurch, {{the remains of a}} WMR 2-6-2 N, NZR 4-6-0 Ub, and two NZR 2-6-2 Wb tank locomotives are {{in the early stages of}} restoration.|$|E

25|$|President Kennedy had {{submitted}} a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which {{was met with}} strong opposition. Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; {{but if it were}} successful, Johnson would receive ample credit. Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 2012 the Nambu (south) Clean Center, a waste {{incinerator}} in Kashiwa, Chiba, {{was taken out}} of production by the city council because the storage room was completely filled with 200 metric tons of radioactive ash that could not disposed of in landfills. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still to be taken out of the incinerator. In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. The Center's special advanced procedures were able to minimize the volume of the ash, but radioactive cesium was concentrated to levels above the national limit of 8.000 becquerels per kilogram for waste disposal in landfills. It was not possible to secure new storage space for the radioactive ash. Radiation levels in Kashiwa were higher than in surrounding areas, and ashes containing up to 70,800 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram – higher than the national limit – were detected in the city. Other cities around Kashiwa were <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problem: radioactive ash was piling up. Chiba prefecture asked Abiko and Inzai to accept temporary storage at the Teganuma waste-disposal facility located at their border. But this met strong opposition from their citizens.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} year of the war, the Allies {{prepared}} for what was anticipated to be a very costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a U.S. conventional and firebombing campaign that destroyed 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe had concluded when Germany signed its instrument of surrender on May 8, 1945, which was eight days after Adolf Hitler committed suicide. The Japanese were <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate but refused to accept the Allies' demands for unconditional surrender, and the war in the Pacific Theatre continued. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being [...] "prompt and utter destruction". The Japanese ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.|$|E
