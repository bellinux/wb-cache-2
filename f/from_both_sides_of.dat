5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete {{to use in}} home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed {{to fill in the}} clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|The city is also {{connected}} to the railway network through the Kanchipuram railway station. The ChengalpetArakkonam railway line passes through Kanchipuram and travellers can access services to those destinations. Daily trains are provided to Pondicherry and Tirupati, {{and there is a}} weekly express train to Madurai and a bi-weekly express train to Nagercoil. Two passenger trains <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Chengalpattu and Arakkonam pass via Kanchipuram.|$|E
5|$|BINA Istra, {{the primary}} {{operator}} of the route, leases the type A, B, and C service areas to various operators through public tenders. As of September 2011, INA was the rest-area operator on the A8 and the A9 motorways. The service area operators {{are not permitted}} to sublease the fuel operations, but can sublease other parts of the service areas. The A8's service areas are accessible <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the motorway and operate 24hours a day, 7days a week.|$|E

5|$|Saga is an epic space opera/fantasy {{comic book}} series written by Brian K. Vaughan and {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, published monthly by the American company Image Comics. The series is heavily influenced by Star Wars {{and is based on}} ideas Vaughan conceived both as a child and as a parent. It depicts a husband and wife, Alana and Marko, from long-warring extraterrestrial races, fleeing authorities <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a galactic war as they struggle to care for their daughter, Hazel, who is born {{in the beginning of the}} series and who occasionally narrates the series as an unseen adult.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in holding back Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 29 August, the Japanese renewed their attack. In {{possession of}} the ridges that dominated the Australian position <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the valley in which it sat, the Japanese were able to lay down considerable volumes of mortar and machine gun fire in support of their assaults. Unable to respond with similar firepower, the Australian perimeter began to shrink. It was during {{this stage of the}} fighting that Private Bruce Kingsbury of the 2/14th made a unique individual contribution to the campaign and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result. Kingsbury's was the first Victoria Cross awarded for actions on Australian soil.|$|E
5000|$|In early April 2013, Luo was {{questioned}} by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Chen Chi-mai regarding {{the effectiveness of}} the MTAC-sponsored student exchange program from Taiwan to Inner Mongolia because most reports made of the trip by the Taiwanese students mentioned the ample drinking opportunities presented to them during the program. The DPP lawmaker even slammed Luo when he found out that one of the student report said that [...] "people <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Taiwan Strait belong to one family".|$|R

5|$|As aforesaid, SVT {{wanted to}} make a good use of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11–13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at the nut, enabling him to amplify sound <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> {{the political}} divide indicate how Chávez {{is seen by}} the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states {{that the company was}} previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E

40|$|We {{clarify the}} {{empirical}} {{source of the}} debate on the effect of technology shocks on hours worked. We argue that the contrasting conclusions from level and difference VAR specifications are not primarily due to {{the presence or absence of}} a unit root in hours worked. Rather they are due to a small, but important, low frequency comovement between hours worked and labour productivity growth. This comovement is allowed for in the levels specification, but assumed away in the difference VAR. Our theoretical analysis shows how the empirical results <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the debate can be reconciled...|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Garnett's and Golding's Farms {{took place}} June 27–28, 1862, in Henrico County, Virginia, {{as part of}} the Seven Days Battles of the American Civil War's Peninsula Campaign. While the battle at Gaines's Mill raged north of the Chickahominy River, the forces of Confederate general John B. Magruder {{conducted}} a reconnaissance in force that developed into a minor attack against the Union line south of the river at Garnett's Farm. The Confederates attacked again near Golding's Farm on the morning of June 28 but in both cases were easily repulsed. The action at the Garnett and Golding farms accomplished little beyond convincing McClellan that he was being attacked <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Chickahominy.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops who fired on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd to then find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly swallowed up by the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the river. Others who saw this turned back to the city in despair.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Vukovar {{took place}} in two phases over about 90 days: from August to September 1991, before the town was fully surrounded, and from early October to mid-November, when the town was encircled then taken by the JNA. From June, the Serb forces {{subjected}} Vukovar and neighbouring villages to daily or near-daily artillery and mortar fire. During July the JNA and TO began deploying in large numbers across eastern Slavonia, surrounding Vukovar on three sides. Heavy fighting began {{at the end of}} August. On 23 August Borovo Naselje came under heavy shellfire. Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav G-2 Galeb fighter aircraft using shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. The following day, the JNA, the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft, naval vessels on the Danube, tanks and artillery. The attack, which was mounted <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the border, caused extensive damage and many civilian casualties.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure the velocities of flow around a circurlar cone. Because of variaton of the cross section area in the longitudinal axis, the flow around the the circular cone behaves very high complex and forms the vortex streets which are issued <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cone and attach in downstream to the plate setting it. The flow fields were visualized using the mixed particles in water and resulted in the velocity fields by the method of Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV). From analyses of the instantaneous velocity fields, the Strouhal numbers which showed an interesting variation were gained to the Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{buildings}} suffered severe damage due to the 1995 Hyogoken-nambu earthquake. In this paper, distribution of damage to buildings was shown based on the statistical damage data. A primary factor of building damage was also investigated <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> building structure and input motion strength. Damage was strongly affected by the kind and oldness of buildings. A lot of old wooden houses with heavy roof ware suffered severe damage. In addition, it made clear that distance to nearest fault and surface soil condition also affect distribution of damage to buildings. Distribution of Human damage was also shown based on the statistical data in this paper. Number of dead person at every site strongly related {{to the number of}} cllapsed wooden buildings...|$|R

5|$|The species {{pertaining}} to Deinosuchus since {{the resurrection of}} the generic name in 1979 have been traditionally recognized as D. rugosus from {{the eastern side of the}} Western Interior Seaway and the larger D. riograndensis from the western side, characterized by differences of the shape of their osteoderms and teeth, this view was not always favored by all researchers and in 2002 it was proposed that there was only one species, Deinosuchus rugosus, with the differences found between the two species explained as the result of the larger size of the western morph. This proposal faced support and criticism and was dropped in 2010 when new fossils of specimens <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the interior seaway showed that the differences between the two morphs were not just size related, teeth from large eastern specimens retained the common characteristics of other specimens of the region and osteoderms from small specimens of the western morph were no different from those of large ones, supporting the specific separation of the two morphs, now formalized as D. rugosus and D. riograndensis.|$|E
5|$|The two Danubian Principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia, {{came under}} direct Russian {{supervision}} upon {{the close of}} the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, being subsequently administered on the basis of common documents, known as Regulamentul Organic. After a period of Russian military occupation, Wallachia returned to Ottoman suzerainty while Russian oversight was preserved, and the throne was awarded to Alexandru II Ghica in 1834—this measure was controversial from the onset, given that, despite the popular provisions of the Akkerman Convention, Ghica had been appointed by Russia and the Ottomans, instead of being elected by the Wallachian Assembly. As a consequence, the Prince was faced with opposition <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the political spectrum, while also attempting to quell the peasantry's discontent by legislating against the abuse of estate lessors. The first liberal movement, taking inspiration from the French Revolution and having for its stated purpose the encouragement of culture, was Societatea Filarmonică (the Philharmonic Society), established in 1833.|$|E
5|$|This petrel is only {{present in}} Madeiran waters during the {{breeding}} season. Its distribution at sea {{during the rest}} of the year is poorly known due to the rarity of the species and the difficulty of separating it from other Pterodroma petrels at sea. Birds identified as either Zino's or Fea's have been recorded <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the North Atlantic, and in Ireland and Britain there has been a large increase in the number of reports, perhaps because global warming brings increasing numbers of tropical species into temperate waters. The timing of the reports, mainly in late spring and summer in the western North Atlantic, and in late summer and early autumn in the east, has suggested that birds follow a clockwise route around the North Atlantic after leaving their breeding sites. However, the few birds that have been identified with certainty have all been Fea's. Zino's petrel may have a similar strategy, since preliminary results from geolocation studies indicate widespread dispersal over the North Atlantic central ridge during the breeding season, and migration towards the Brazilian coast in the non-breeding period. Pterodroma petrels have been recorded in the Canary Islands and the Azores on surprisingly few occasions; a claim of possible Zino's from South Africa is now thought to be erroneous.|$|E

40|$|The {{heat from}} the sun, coupled with the wind, {{has been used to}} dry and {{preserve}} food crops for several thousand years. Some crops, such as Chili, Bananas, Coffee Beans, timber, need to be dried before they can be used effectively. Sun drying has often developed into solar drying, where drying occurs is in an enclosed, ventilated area–often using polythene, acrylic or glass covering. Present work deals with design, fabrication of double flow solar dryer. Double flow solar air heater is the advanced modification of single flow solar air heater. In the single flow solar air heater, air flows through one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> copper plate whereas in the double flow solar air heater air flow <b>from</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> copper plate and hence more efficient than any other kind of solar air heater...|$|R
