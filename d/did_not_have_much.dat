5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|Edward <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> to do {{with any}} of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E

5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} gather {{research}} for the series, Hoshino once visited New York as she believes the city left a deep influence in her works. She also visited graveyards since she never had resources for the series. The ground zero of the World Trade Center after the September 11 attacks also left a big impression in her based on the guides' comments. Hoshino commented she would rather go again as she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> time to stay in New York.|$|E

With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E
5|$|Born in Conegliano, Veneto, Del Piero {{is the son}} of Gino, an electrician, and Bruna, a housekeeper. He {{regularly}} {{played football}} in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo, as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers, but only Alessandro would eventually manage to do so. Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as Alessandro's agent. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> money for travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order to see the world.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted a more radical religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and denial of the dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able}} to achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi anti-tobacco {{campaign}} included banning {{smoking in}} trams, buses and city trains, promoting health education, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers, {{and raising the}} tobacco tax. The National Socialists also imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising and smoking in public spaces, and regulated restaurants and coffeehouses. The anti-tobacco movement <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> effect {{in the early years}} of the Nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939, but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. Even by the end of the 20th century, the anti-smoking movement in postwar Germany had not attained the influence of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{failure to}} advance in Italy prompted the Combined Chiefs of Staff to postpone Operation Anvil, the on-again-off-again proposal for Allied landings {{along the coast}} of southern France coinciding with Overlord. Clark told Devers that another attack on the Gustav Line could not be mounted until May, and VI Corps could not be withdrawn from Anzio until it succeeded. But planning for Anvil, begun in mid-January by AFHQ's Force 163 in Algiers continued. Initially Clark was to lead the assault, with Lucas taking over Fifth Army. Devers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> faith in either of them, even before Lucas' relief. Lyman Lemnitzer later recalled that Fifth Army staff feared that Devers would relieve Clark every time the two met.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of October27 the Colombian Government issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for the islands of San Andrés and Providencia. Hours later, a hurricane watch was issued. By late morning, both advisories were replaced by a hurricane warning. The island <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> time to prepare for Hurricane Beta, being struck only three days after its formation. Of its 5,000residents all stayed to weather the storm but, about 300 of them evacuated wooden homes on the beach for sturdier brick shelters inland on the island's mountains. The neighbouring island of San Andrés initiated a moratorium on all outdoor activities as the storm's outer bands reached the island on October 29. Officials evacuated about 700 people, 500 tourists and 200 residents on San Andrés to temporary shelters. The Colombian Government provided 8tons (7.2tonnes) of food and emergency supplies, including 1,100 sheets, 300 hammocks, and 350 cooking kits to the island.|$|E
5|$|Gupte {{described}} his character as mercurial, and found playing him a physical delight.

Chandan Roy Sanyal {{described his}} character Mikhail as provocative, mad, wicked and humorous. Subramnayam and Joshi, who played Lobo and Lele respectively, described their characters as the most corrupt policemen in their department at the Anti-Narcotics Bureau. They said that {{to prepare for the}} roles they followed the script and Bhardwaj's instructions to get the characters right. Mukherjee prepared for his role as Mujeeb by reading the script and understanding the characters, and discussing it with Bhardwaj. Dutta, who played Shumona Bengali criminal involved in fixing horse races and arms dealingsaid that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>much</b> time to prepare for his role because he was given the script after he arrived in Mumbai, where Bhardwaj briefed him.|$|E
