5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
25|$|Following President Enrique Peña Nieto's {{proposal}} to legalize same-sex marriage in Mexico, a poll {{on the issue}} {{was carried out by}} Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica. 69% of respondents were in favor of the change. 64% said they saw it as an advance in the recognition of human rights. Public opinion has changed radically over the course of 16 years. In 2000, 62% felt that same-sex marriage should not be allowed under any circumstances. In 2016, only 25% <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{the end of}} {{the four}} day engagement, Deke's {{management}} is offered a one-man show in Freegate, Texas, outside of Dallas. Due to the terms of the contract, Tex fires Susan and the singing trio, leaving only Deke in the show. Before he has to begin his new tour, Deke drives Susan to her family's farm. Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a story to tell Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate. Back on the farm, Deke and Susan talk, where she tells him about being fired, after which they are about to kiss, when they are interrupted by her parents, who ask him to sing the song he promised. After Deke sings [...] "Loving You", a surprised Susan remarks that she never heard him sing that way; Deke admits that he never <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> before.|$|E

"Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I ever <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, she had expected to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E

2500|$|The FAA {{learned that}} Eastern {{had said it}} would pay any fines from the FAA for the {{practice}} of flying in excess of regulations. The machinists, pilots, and flight attendants were all subjected to increasingly stringent absenteeism rules which would allow Eastern to fire them after fewer infractions than before. Eastern also fired increasing numbers of employees under allegations of drug abuse and phony medical claims and insubordination. A study by Virginia Tech in 1987 showed that only 2% of Eastern pilots described their jobs as [...] "very rewarding", while 85% at the others surveyed <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> By September 1987, Eastern's employment rolls had been reduced by 4,000 to 39,000 people. Both Eastern and the machinists' union prepared for a strike to occur.|$|E

Initially, he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety, but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled: [...] "In Step was, for him, a big growing experience. In my opinion, it's our best studio album, and I think he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> too." [...] Bramhall, who had also entered rehab, wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption. According to Vaughan, the album was titled In Step because [...] "I'm finally in step with life, in step with myself, in step with my music."

2500|$|Men enjoyed {{having a}} space that was free of women and which in the late 1940s [...] "allowed them to {{continue}} the kind of male companionship and adventure they had enjoyed during the Second World War." [...] In one news article about Antarctica written in 1958, the writer describes the use of dazzlement: [...] "On the womanless continent, {{the purpose of the}} dazzlement is not to catch the eye of a flirtatious blonde, but to attract spotters in the event that the explorers become lost in the frozen waste." [...] Men's spaces in Antarctica resisted change. In the 1980s, there was an attempt by men to memorialize the [...] "Sistine ceiling" [...] of the Weddell hut in Antarctica as an Australian national heritage site of [...] "high significance." [...] The [...] "Sistine ceiline" [...] was covered in 92 different pornographic pinups of women from the 1970s and 1980s. This represented a [...] "male's only club" [...] in which participants believed women would spoil the [...] "purity of a homosocial work--and play--environment." [...] In 1983, the San Bernardino County Sun newspaper published an article about Antarctica stating that it [...] "is still one of the last macho redoubts, where men are men and women are superfluous." [...] One scientist, Lyle McGinnis, who had been going to Antarctica since 1957 resented women in the field, saying that [...] "men never grouse," [...] but he believed that women complained and needed [...] "comfort." [...] Not all men <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Other men felt that women's presence made life in Antarctica better and one male engineer stated that without women around, [...] "men are pigs."

She was appalled at the behaviour shown by some of the customers portrayed in the episodes, and impressed by the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> staff were shown dealing with such abuse.

500|$|Ultima Underworld was {{conceived}} in 1989 by Origin Systems employee Paul Neurath.
