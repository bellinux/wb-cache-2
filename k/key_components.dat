The company's owners became increasingly reluctant to fund the unprofitable business.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Reagan {{challenged}} incumbent President Gerald Ford {{in a bid}} {{to become}} the Republican Party's candidate for president.

5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving <b>key</b> <b>components</b> of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the front office were expected during the offseason.|$|E

5|$|Belenggu was {{submitted}} to Balai Pustaka {{for publication in}} 1938, but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality, particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution– <b>key</b> <b>components</b> of the plot– as acceptable. Eventually Belenggu {{was picked up by}} Poedjangga Baroe and published in a serial format in three editions between April and June 1940. Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel. In 1969, Belenggu received the first annual Literary Prize from the government of Indonesia, along with Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), Salah Asuhan, and Achdiat Karta Mihardja's Atheis (Atheist; 1949).|$|E
5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth century for research into electrical phenomena. Its <b>key</b> <b>components</b> are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E

Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E

Though Reagan lost the Republican nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. Ford ultimately lost the general election to Carter.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more <b>key</b> <b>components,</b> would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E

The first of these, STS-97, docked in early December 2000, and brought the first pair of large U.S. {{photovoltaic}} arrays, which increased the station's power capabilities fivefold. The second visiting shuttle mission was STS-98, which was docked in mid-February 2001, delivered the US$1.4billion research module Destiny, which increased {{the mass of the}} station beyond that of Mir for the first time. Mid-March 2001 saw the final shuttle visit of the expedition, STS-102, whose main purpose was to exchange the Expedition 1 crew with the next three-person long-duration crew, Expedition 2. The expedition ended when Discovery undocked from the station on 18 March 2001.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the <b>key</b> <b>components</b> of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E

3000|$|A {{simple way}} for the base station to deliver the root key to a {{particular}} target sensor node would be for it to use the target's public key to encrypt the root key. However, this is susceptible to capture and replay by an adversary at a later time, potentially allowing the attacker to revert the sensor nodes to an earlier code image. To protect against this, we implement an authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange first to generate a secure channel, and then to use that channel for the root key transfer. The base station initiates the Diffie-Hellman exchange by sending a digitally signed message containing its ephemeral <b>key</b> <b>component,</b> and the target node responds correspondingly with its own signed ephemeral <b>key</b> <b>component.</b> The shared ephemeral key is then generated by each side by combining the received <b>key</b> <b>component</b> with its own <b>key</b> <b>component.</b> This shared <b>key</b> allows secure transfer of the root key [...]...|$|R
