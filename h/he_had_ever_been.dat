5|$|However, {{contemporary}} {{records show}} that his grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a veterinarian, not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard was actually raised in a townhouse {{in the center of}} Helena. According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but did own one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside the city. Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. While some sources support Scientology's claim of Hubbard's blood brotherhood, other sources say that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence has been found that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a Blackfeet blood brother.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> to that point in his life.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 2004 Hazes died {{of cardiac}} arrest. Eventually his {{lifestyle}} had {{caught up with}} him, and somehow he became bigger in death than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> during his lifetime.

As part of a plea deal, the man was sentenced to 4 years in prison. Neturei Karta has denied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a member of their group.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{retrying}} Remington {{under the}} existing indictment, the government presented {{a new one}} charging Remington with five counts of perjury based on his testimony during the first trial. The charge from the first trial, that he perjured himself when denying <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a Communist Party member, was not included.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Yanni played in a local rock band and {{continued}} to study piano and other keyboard instruments.

25|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} way of naming a dynasty after the first ruler's home district, Zhu Yuanzhang's choice of 'Ming' or 'Brilliant' for his dynasty followed a Mongol precedent of an uplifting title. Zhu Yuanzhang also took 'Hongwu', or 'Vastly Martial' as his reign title. Although the White Lotus had fomented his rise to power, the emperor later denied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a member of their organization and suppressed the religious movement after he became emperor.|$|E
25|$|Panufnik {{continued}} {{to find it}} frustratingly difficult to get permission {{to travel to the}} States. In the wake of McCarthyism, the staff at the American Embassy in London were unhelpful, and treated him with suspicion: Panufnik was surprised to have to supply fingerprints, and he was pointedly asked more than once whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a member of the Polish United Workers' Party. The irony of this difficulty, after his recent public defection to the west, was not lost on Panufnik.|$|E
25|$|Loeb's journalism résumé was {{the subject}} of {{skepticism}} in 1974, when he claimed in a front-page editorial to have worked for the Hearst conglomerate, as a reporter for the New York World for eight years before buying his St. Albans paper. Hearst Corporation denied <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> employed there, and the World had actually ceased operations eight years before Loeb said he had started work there. Toledo Blade chairman Paul Block, Jr. also denied ever seeing Loeb on the assignments he claimed to have worked.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{score on the}} first round in Monte Carlo, Loeb was {{initially}} forced to activate the SupeRally rules for retiring competitors, having spun off the road on day one. Although he did manage to fight {{his way back to}} second place, {{it was the first time}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> beaten to the finish (namely by fellow double world champion Marcus Grönholm) on these roads in the Xsara WRC. This outcome was mirrored on the following month's Swedish Rally, with Grönholm again the man to whom Loeb was forced to give best, placing the duo in an early runaway 1–2 position in the points standings.|$|E
25|$|Bridges {{became a}} {{naturalized}} U.S. citizen in 1945. With {{the goal of}} deportation, in 1948 the federal government tried Bridges for fraud and perjury, for denying when applying for naturalization that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> {{a member of the}} Communist Party. The jury convicted Bridges and two co-defendants. He was sentenced {{to five years in prison}} and his citizenship was revoked. The Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision overturned the conviction in 1953 because the indictment on fraud and perjury charges did not occur within the three years set by the statute of limitations. The government dropped the criminal charges and pursued a case in civil court in June and July 1955, hoping to overturn Bridges' naturalization because it had been obtained by fraud. The trial judge ruled in Bridges' favor and the government did not appeal.|$|E

500|$|Carruth {{secured a}} North American {{distribution}} deal with THINKFilm after the company's head of theatrical distribution, Mark Urman, saw the film at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. Although he and Carruth made a [...] "handshake agreement" [...] during the festival, Urman {{reported that the}} actual negotiation of the deal was the longest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> involved with, {{in part due to}} Carruth's specific demands over how much control over the film he would retain. The film went on to take $424,760 at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Ecclestone {{returned}} {{at about}} 10:55 {{to inform the}} group that Todt had refused {{to agree to the}} chicane, maintaining that it was an FIA and a Michelin problem and not his. By the time Stoddart's account of the meeting was published, Todt had already denied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> consulted, but stated that, if asked, he would not have agreed to the chicane.

5000|$|After {{they discuss}} the war, Bohannon asks Johnson if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> to Meridian. Johnson {{responds}} by taking Bohannon hostage. Johnson tells Bohannon that he read of the Union soldier killed in Washington, DC by a Griswold revolver, and seeing Bohannon's Griswold when he hired him, coupled with Bohannon's mention of Meridian, confirmed his suspicions.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{valuable}} pieces <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> made <b>was</b> a pintail in 1973, as a present for his wife.

The decoy was estimated to be worth $150,000.|$|R
500|$|The {{changes to}} his face were, in part, due to periods of {{significant}} weight loss.

500|$|He ended all {{relations}} with the Party in 1949. Rossen was twice called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), in 1951 and in 1953. He exercised his Fifth Amendment rights at his first appearance, refusing to state whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> a Communist. As a result, he found himself blacklisted by Hollywood studios as well as unable to renew his passport. At his second appearance he named 57 people as current or former Communists and his blacklisting ended. In order to repair finances he produced his next film, Mambo, in Italy in 1954. While The Hustler in 1961 was a great success, conflicts {{on the set of}} [...] Lilith so disillusioned him that it was his last film.|$|E
