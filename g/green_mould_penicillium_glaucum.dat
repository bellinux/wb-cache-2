Ethiopian plant extracts of Acacia seyal (Del. Var. Seyal) and Withania somnifera (L.) Dual {{were used to}} test the control of <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> in wound-inoculated fruit, stored for 21 d at 7 °C and at > 85 % RH. The chemical compositions of the two extracts were determined using high-performance chromatography. Thereafter, freshly harvested (naturally infected) fruit were subjected to different postharvest treatments and stored for 50 d to investigate the effects of the two plant extracts on fruit quality parameters. Treatments included (pre-wax + leaf extracts), (wax + leaf extracts incorporated into wax, Citrosol A®), (leaf extract alone), (fruit washed in chlorinated water at 5. 25 %), (untreated fruit) and (commercially treated fruit). Results. Extracts of A. seyal and W. somnifera reduced the incidence of <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> by 56. 1 % and 50 %, respectively, in wound-inoculated fruit. A. seyal extract contained a high concentration of gallic acid (60. 3 mg·mL– 1) whilst W. somnifera contained low concentrations of caffeic acid (8. 7 mg·mL– 1), salicylic acid (6. 3 mg·mL– 1) and 3, 4 dihydroxy benzoic acid (3. 8 mg·mL– 1). <b>Green</b> <b>mould</b> was absent in naturally infected fruit subjected to (pre-wax + leaf extracts), (wax mixed with leaf extracts) and (leaf extracts) treatments. (Pre-wax + leaf extracts) and (wax mixed with leaf extract) treatments significantly reduced weight loss; retained firmness and colour; and they maintained eating qualities and a maturity index (SSC/TA) similar to commercial treatment. Conclusion. Both extracts of A. seyal and W. somnifera showed potential to be used as an alternative in combined applications with wax application under low temperature storage to replace synthetic fungicides, to ultimately control <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> and retain overall fruit quality...|$|R

50|$|<b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> {{feeds on}} only one optical isomer of tartaric acid, which makes it {{extremely}} useful in chemistry projects on chirality.|$|R
50|$|Between 1870 and 1874, Roberts {{studied the}} {{dissolution}} of bacteria in cultures contaminated by a mold. He specifically studied the impact of <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum,</b> a close relative of the Penicillium notatum.|$|R
50|$|Today, it {{is mainly}} {{produced}} in the northern Italian regions of Piedmont and Lombardy. Whole cow's milk is used, to which starter bacteria are added, along with spores of the mold <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum.</b> <b>Penicillium</b> roqueforti, used in Roquefort cheese, may also be used. The whey is then removed during curdling, and the result aged at low temperatures.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} blue cheeses {{are made in}} a similar way to Blue Stilton. These cheeses get their blue veins and {{distinct}} flavour from the use of one or more saprotrophic fungi such as Penicillium roqueforti and <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{biggest mistake}} by the Institute was {{ignoring}} a dissertation by Ernest Duchesne {{on the use}} of <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> to cure infections in 1897. The early exploitation of his discovery might have saved millions of lives, especially in World War I.|$|R
40|$|Stored {{citrus fruit}} suffer huge losses {{because of the}} {{development}} of <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> caused by <b>Penicillium</b> digitatum. Usually synthetic fungicides are employed to control this disease, but their use is facing some obstacles, such public concern about possible adverse effects on human and environmental health and the development of resistant pathogen populations. In the present study quercetin, scopoletin and scoparone—phenolic compounds present in several agricultural commodities and associated with response to stresses—were firstly tested in vitro against P. digitatum and then applied in vivo on oranges cv. Navelina. Fruits were wound-treated (100 µg), pathogen-inoculated, stored and surveyed for disease incidence and severity. Although only a minor (≤ 13 %) control effect on P. digitatum growth was recorded in vitro, the in vivo trial results were encouraging. In fact, on phenolic-treated oranges, symptoms appeared at 6 days post-inoculation (DPI), i. e., with a 2 day-delay as compared to the untreated control. Moreover, at 8 DPI, quercetin, scopoletin, and scoparone significantly reduced disease incidence and severity by 69 %– 40 % and 85 %– 70 %, respectively, as compared to the control. At 14 DPI, scoparone was the most active molecule. Based on the results, these compounds might represent an interesting alternative to synthetic fungicides...|$|R
40|$|Imazalil (IMZ) is {{commonly}} applied in South African citrus packhouses {{for the control}} of <b>green</b> <b>mould,</b> caused by <b>Penicillium</b> digitatum, yet the disease still causes significant postharvest losses. The maximum residue limit (MRL) for IMZ on citrus fruit is 5 μgg- 1, whereas 2 - 3 μgg- 1 is a biologically effective residue level that should at least inhibit <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> sporulation. Standard compliance auditing of residue levels of citrus fruit, however, indicate that fruit from the majority of packhouses have residues of ≈ 1 μgg- 1. Poor disease control from insufficient residue loading might further be compounded {{by the presence of}} IMZ-resistant isolates of P. digitatum in packhouses. This study was conducted to assess the current status of IMZ application in South African packhouses, to determine the adequate residue levels needed to control <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> and inhibit its sporulation using both IMZ sensitive and resistant isolates, to investigate IMZ application methods and resultant residue levels in commercial citrus packhouses, and to study optimisation of modes of IMZ application in citrus packhouses. Factors studied were IMZ concentration, application type (spray vs. dip and drench), exposure time, solution temperature and pH, as well as curative and protective control of P. digitatum. The packhouse survey showed that the majority of packhouses applied IMZ in a sulphate salt formulation through a fungicide dip tank, and loaded an IMZ residue of ≈ 1 μgg- 1. In dip applications, IMZ had excellent curative and protective activity against Penicillium isolates sensitive to IMZ. However, curative control of IMZ resistant isolates was substantially reduced and protective control was lost, even at twice the recommended concentration, nor was sporulation inhibited. The use of sodium bicarbonate (2 %) buffered imazalil sulphate solutions at pH ± 8, compared with pH ± 3 of the unbuffered solutions, markedly increased IMZ residue loading on Navel and Valencia oranges and improved curative and protective control of IMZ resistant isolates. Exposure time did not affect IMZ residue loading in IMZ sulphate solutions at pH 3, although the MRL was exceeded after 45 s exposure in pH 8 solutions. Imazalil applied through spray or drench application improved residue loading, but <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> control was less effective than after dip application. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. Articl...|$|R
50|$|The first {{reported}} kinetic resolution {{was achieved by}} Louis Pasteur.

5000|$|In 1897, {{doctoral}} student Ernest Duchesne submitted a dissertation, [...] "Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes" [...] (Contribution {{to the study}} of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between molds and microbes), the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of molds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and molds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. Duchesne observed that E. coli was eliminated by <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> when they were both grown in the same culture. He also observed that when he inoculated laboratory animals with lethal doses of typhoid bacilli together with <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum,</b> the animals did not contract typhoid.

50|$|Bleu d'Auvergne has {{a strong}} and pungent taste, but {{to a lesser extent}} than other blue cheeses; it is less salted, with a creamier and more buttery taste and a moister texture. Some recipes also use a weaker form of mold, <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum,</b> to create the blue veins, rather than the Penicillium roqueforti used in Roquefort and other blue cheeses.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, {{physician}} Sir William Roberts {{noted that}} {{cultures of the}} mold <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> that {{is used in the}} making of some types of blue cheese did not display bacterial contamination. In 1876, physicist John Tyndall also contributed to this field. Pasteur conducted research showing that Bacillus anthracis would not grow {{in the presence of the}} related mold Penicillium notatum.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> is a mold {{that is used}} in {{the making}} of some types of blue cheese, {{including}} Bleu de Gex, Rochebaron, and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola.

50|$|Blue cheese {{undergoes}} {{the aforementioned}} steps with an added twist that gives it its unique look of blue streaks found all throughout. The blue veins {{are a result}} of adding the molds Penicillium roqueforti and <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> to the cheesemaking process, often introduced after the curds have been ladled into containers in order to be drained and formed into a full wheel of cheese. Although Penicillium roqueforti and <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum</b> are found naturally, cheese producers nowadays use commercially manufactured Penicillium roqueforti culture that have been freeze-dried, a form of dehydration where water is evaporated from the frozen state without the transition through the liquid state, to retain their value and are activated with the addition of water. After the addition of the molds to the cheese, the next significant step is needling, which is when the wheels of blue cheese are pierced to create small openings to allow the air to enter and feed the mold cultures, thus encouraging the formation of blue veins.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} soon made {{out that these}} yeast organisms, to which Turpin gave the name of Torula cerevisiae, were more nearly allied to the lower Fungi than to {{anything}} else. Indeed Turpin, and subsequently Berkeley and Hoffmann, believed that they had traced {{the development of the}} Torula into the well-known and very common mould--the <b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum.</b> Other observers have not succeeded in verifying these statements; and my own observations lead me to believe, that while the connection between Torula and the moulds is a very close one, it is of a different nature from that which has been supposed. I {{have never been able to}} trace the development of Torula into a true mould; but it is quite easy to prove that species of true <b>mould,</b> such as <b>Penicillium,</b> when sown in an appropriate nidus, such as a solution of tartrate of ammonia and yeast-ash, in water, with or without sugar, give rise to Torulae, similar in all respects to T. cerevisiae, except that they are, on the average, smaller. Moreover, Bail has observed the development of a Torula larger than T. cerevisiae, from a Mucor, a <b>mould</b> allied to <b>Penicillium.</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of two salts, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, to activate defence mechanisms in citrus fruit against postharvest <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> caused by <b>Penicillium</b> digitatum. In particular, once confirmed salt antifungal activity in absence of direct contact with the pathogen, changes in enzymatic activity and expression level of chitinase, ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), and, consequently, in phytoalexin (scoparone, scopoletin, umbelliferone) and sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose) content in treated oranges were analyzed. Overall, sodium carbonate and bicarbonate proved to increase the activity of ß- 1, 3 -glucanase, peroxidase, and PAL enzymes in orange tissues. Gene expression analyses confirmed PAL up-regulation particularly at 12 h after treatment application. Furthermore, HPLC analyses of peel extracts showed increased amounts of the tested sugars and phytoalexins, as compared to those found in control tissues, with sucrose and scoparone being the most represented. The obtained results suggest that, although salts exert a direct antifungal effect on P. digitatum, they are also able to induce citrus fruit defense mechanisms to postharvest decays. The defense response seems correlated with the up-regulation of phenylpropanoid pathway, which has a role in the adaptation to various stresses. This response could sum up to citrus natural reaction to wounding and pathogen attack, enhancing its protective effect. As a consequence, the fruit might have a better chance for a successful defence against the decay...|$|R

Pasteur (1860) was the first to demonstrate tartrate decomposition by a mold (<b>Penicillium</b> <b>glaucum)</b> and utilized its ability to decompose selectively the dextro modification in obtaining the levo form from a racemic mixture. With the exception of Pasteur, Pfeffer (1895) was the only investigator found to have devoted more than incidental attention to a study of tartrate decomposi-tion by fungi.

40|$|In {{recent years}} <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> (Trichoderma aggressivum) has {{presented}} big problems to the Dutch mushroom industry. T. aggressivum infects compost {{at a very}} early stage and in the Dutch situation infection most likely takes place at the compost yard. Even though compost producers in the Netherlands are very keen to prevent <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> problems, occasionally still a number of crops get infected. Therefore {{there is a need for}} a reliable method that allows early detection of Trichoderma <b>green</b> <b>mould.</b> Although qPCR methods have been developed for quantitation of T. aggressivum, these cannot be used for detection in compost. In the Netherlands spawn run is performed in bulk at the compost yards and is referred to as phase 3 composting. During this process, spawned compost is incubated in tunnels and ventilated with large volumes of air to control compost temperature. During this process the compost is inaccessible for sampling. Literature data showed that Agaricus bisporus and T. aggressivum use volatiles to affect each other’s growth rate. We tested the possibility to detect Trichoderma <b>green</b> <b>mould</b> using the volatiles that are emitted during spawn run. This eventually could lead to a sophisticated non-invasive detection method of T. aggressivum in the process air of the tunnels, without the need to sample inside the tunnel during spawn run. For this we compared volatiles that are produced in non-infected compost with volatiles that are produced in infected compost. In our experimental model, 300 g of phase 2 compost, is spawned and inserted in aerated glass vessels. Compost is colonised at an air temperature of 24 °C. After 7, 10 and 14 days of spawn run, process air is sampled both in infected and non-infected cultures and analysed by coupled gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). During this 14 -day period white mushroom mycelium develops in the non-infected compost. In the infected compost the compost turns black with occasional tufts of white mycelium and green spores. Volatile blends that are produced during normal compost colonisation (when Agaricus bisporus interacts with Scytalidium thermophilum and other micro flora present in compost) differ from those produced during colonisation of T. aggressivum infected compost. Some of the volatiles appear to be specific for T. aggressivum infected compost. Next to this also consistent differences in the overall pattern of volatile production are seen. Infections with T. harzianum, T. atroviride, an Aspergillus species, or Smokey <b>mould</b> (<b>Penicillium</b> citreonigrum) produce different volatile patterns. Significant differences between the volatile blends of infected and non-infected compost are visible after 7 days of compost colonisation. In commercial practice of phase 3 composting, tunnels are likely to be partially infected. On-going research is directed at studying larger amounts of compost that is only partially infected...|$|R

The mold grows within the cheese as it ages. These cheeses have distinct blue veins, which gives them their name and, often, assertive flavors. The molds range from pale green to dark blue, and may be accompanied by white and crusty brown molds. Their texture can be soft or firm. Some of the most renowned cheeses are of this type, each with its own distinctive color, flavor, texture and aroma. They include Roquefort, Gorgonzola and Stilton.|$|R
