But it all happened, and Lapham promptly developed his ideas of black walnut finish, high studding, and cornices. The architect was able to conceal the shudder which they must have sent through him. He was skilful, as nearly all architects are, in playing upon that simple <b>instrument</b> <b>Man.</b> He began to touch Colonel Lapham's stops.|$|E

This is the plain {{manifest}} doctrine of Holy Scripture: [...] "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king as supreme," [...] &c.[6] And another apostle telleth us, [...] "The powers that be are ordained of God." [...] Kings are the ordinances of man by the permission of God, and they are ordained of God by his <b>instrument</b> <b>man.</b> The powers that be, the present powers, which are ordained by God, and yet in some sense are the ordinances of man, are what you must obey, without presuming to examine into rights and titles; neither can it be reasonably expected, that the powers in being, or in possession, should suffer their title to be publicly disputed by subjects without severe punishment. And to say the truth, there is no duty in religion more easy to the generality of mankind, than obedience to government: I say to the generality of mankind; because while their law, and property, and religion are preserved, it is of no great consequence to them by whom they are governed, and therefore they are under no temptation to desire a change.|$|E

60|$|He {{was a great}} figure, and the {{principal}} figure, {{at one of the}} first of the now worn-out Authors' Readings, which was held in the Boston Museum to aid a Longfellow memorial. It was the late George Parsons Lathrop (everybody seems to be late in these sad days) who imagined the reading, {{but when it came to}} a price for seats I can always claim the glory of fixing it at five dollars. The price if not the occasion proved irresistible, and the museum was packed from the floor to the topmost gallery. Norton presided, and when it came Clemens's turn to read he introduced him with such exquisite praises as he best knew how to give, but before he closed he fell a prey to one of those lapses of tact which are the peculiar peril of people of the greatest tact. He was reminded of Darwin's delight in Mark Twain, and how when he came from his long day's exhausting study, and sank into bed at midnight, he took up a volume of Mark Twain, whose books he always kept on a table beside him, and whatever had been his tormenting problem, or excess of toil, he felt secure of a good night's rest from it. A sort of blank ensued which Clemens filled in the only possible way. He said he should always be glad that he had contributed to the repose of that great man, whom science owed so much, and then without waiting for the joy in every breast to burst forth, he began to read. It was curious to watch his triumph with the house. His carefully studied effects would reach the first rows in the orchestra first, and ripple in laughter back to the standees against the wall, and then with a fine resurgence come again to the rear orchestra seats, and so rise from gallery to gallery till it fell back, a cataract of applause from the topmost rows of seats. He was such a practised speaker that he knew all the stops of that simple <b>instrument</b> <b>man,</b> and there is no doubt that these results were accurately intended from his unerring knowledge. He was the most consummate public performer I ever saw, and it was an incomparable pleasure to hear him lecture; on the platform he was the great and finished actor which he probably would not have been on the stage. He was fond of private theatricals, and liked to play in them with his children and their friends, in dramatizations of such stories of his as 'The Prince and the Pauper;' but I never saw him in any of these scenes. When he read his manuscript to you, it was with a thorough, however involuntary, recognition of its dramatic qualities; he held that an actor added fully half to the character the author created. With my own hurried and half- hearted reading of passages which I wished to try on him from unprinted chapters (say, out of 'The Undiscovered Country' or 'A Modern Instance') he said frankly that my reading could spoil anything. He was realistic, but he was essentially histrionic, and he was rightly so. What we have strongly conceived we ought to make others strongly imagine, and we ought to use every genuine art to that end.|$|E

40|$|To {{compare the}} quality of calcium {{hydroxide}} paste fillings performed by three different techniques. Sixty extracted maxillary central incisors, with previous root canal treatment, were decoronated and the gutta-percha was completely removed from the root canals. Subsequently, the canals were filled with a calcium hydroxide-based paste composed of calcium hydroxide, bismuth carbonate, and glycerin. The study samples were divided into the following three groups {{on the basis of}} three insertion techniques (n = 20, each) : conventional technique using a hand <b>instrument</b> (<b>MAN),</b> rotary Lentulo spiral (LEN) technique, and a combined technique combining conventional hand files with sonic activation through the EndoActivator device (EA). The quality of fillings was evaluated radiographically by two examiners {{on the basis of the}} amount of voids and the apical limit. The canals filled with LEN or MAN had less void volume compared to the EA technique (P > 0. 01), with no significant differences between them. Considering the apical limits, the three tested techniques showed comparable results (P > 0. 05). A combined approach utilizing hand files with sonic activation showed no enhancements over the LEN or MAN techniques on {{the quality of}} intracanal placement of calcium hydroxide paste...|$|E

[...] Similar strategies of negation and dismissal of responsibility were displayed by SS men during their post-war trials, either by way of legitimizing their actions as a result of unconditional obedience to their superiors (intimating responsibility onto them) or through the use of innocuous sounding bureaucratic language.|$|R
