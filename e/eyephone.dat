50|$|The <b>EyePhone</b> was {{featured}} in the 1992 science fiction film The Lawnmower Man.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the episode}} focuses on parodies of the iPhone and Twitter, renamed the <b>eyePhone</b> and Twitcher respectively. The <b>eyePhone</b> is placed {{directly}} in the eye, hence the name <b>eyePhone.</b> Fry asks, [...] "Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?", to which Bender replies, [...] "August 6, 1991", which is the date that Tim Berners-Lee announced the World Wide Web project and software on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. A video clip shot by Fry reveals that Leela has a boil (voiced by Craig Ferguson) named Susan on her right buttock that sings show tunes with a Scottish accent, a reference to singer Susan Boyle. The song that was shown in the episode was [...] "I Dreamed a Dream", the same song which Susan Boyle performed in her first audition of Britain's Got Talent which later brought her world-wide fame.|$|E
5000|$|Bender's good twin Flexo makes a brief cameo {{in one of}} the {{recycling}} bins. The cell phone Amy throws away before getting an <b>eyePhone</b> is the same as in [...] "Amazon Women in the Mood". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in [...] "A Leela of Her Own".|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Mom reveals to {{her sons}} that the <b>eyePhones</b> {{allow her to}} direct market to the users, {{based on what they}} post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be {{transmitted}} as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.|$|R
50|$|Exergaming {{contains}} elements that {{were developed in}} the virtual reality community during the 1980s. The pioneer in this area was Autodesk, which developed two systems, the HighCycle and Virtual Racquetball. The HighCycle was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. Virtual Racquetball tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet {{that was used to}} hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the VPL <b>eyephones,</b> an early head-mounted display (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in {{the late}} 1980s, the Data Suit by VPL Research {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} mo-cap suits in the market. Sensors stitched in the Data Suit were connected by fiber-optic cables to computers that updated the visuals 15 to 30 times a second. The Data Suit was ahead of its time, selling for up to $500,000 for a complete system (along with the <b>EyePhone</b> and the Data Glove).|$|E
50|$|Leela {{discovers that}} her humiliation is old news {{and that a}} new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals {{to her that he}} posted a video of himself {{completing}} the loser’s side of the bet in order {{to make up for the}} humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the <b>eyePhone</b> 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.|$|E
5000|$|... "Attack of the Killer App" [...] is {{the third}} episode of the sixth season of the American {{animated}} sitcom Futurama. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 1, 2010. The episode focuses on {{the release of the}} new <b>eyePhone,</b> resulting in Fry posting a viral video of Leela on the Internet. Craig Ferguson, host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, guest stars as Leela's singing boil, Susan.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{decides he}} needs to have more {{interesting}} twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that Leela has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his <b>eyePhone,</b> {{in spite of his}} promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including Hermes Conrad, Amy Wong and Pro. Farnsworth.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{opens with}} the Planet Express crew {{recycling}} their old electronics. Hubert J. Farnsworth announces {{that they will}} be delivering all the Earth’s e-waste to the Third World of the Antares system. After dropping them off, they decide {{it would be better to}} keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new <b>eyePhone.</b> The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the Twitcher application. Bender and Fry get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Canning of IGN in {{his review}} gave the episode an 8.5 calling it [...] "Great" [...] and also stated {{in his review}} [...] ""Attack of the Killer App" [...] had more than enough great laughs to {{outweigh}} this weak bit", {{in reference to the}} Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes. The A.V. Club reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying [...] "This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew." [...] He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be [...] "mean-spirited" [...] but clever and so [...] "bizarre that it worked". Darren Franich of EW Popwatch said the episode was [...] "as good as anything the show produced in its prime" [...] particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling [...] "outdated". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 7.1. While he found the <b>eyePhone</b> jokes to be clever he refers to the Boil plotline as [...] "a horrifically stupid joke that dominates and largely ruins {{the second part of the}} episode".|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{mechanism}} for initiating mediated conversations through eye contact. An <b>eyePHONE</b> is a physical proxy of a remote individual that senses and conveys attention using an eye tracking device {{and a pair of}} actuated eyeballs. Users may initiate calls by jointly looking at each other’s <b>eyePHONE.</b> We discuss how this allows participants to implement some of the basic social rules of face-to-face conversations in mediated conversations...|$|E
40|$|As {{smartphones}} evolve {{researchers are}} studying new techniques {{to ease the}} human-mobile interaction. We propose <b>EyePhone,</b> a novel “hand-free ” interfacing system capable of driving mobile applications/functions using only the user’s eyes movement and actions (e. g., wink). <b>EyePhone</b> tracks the user’s eye movement across the phone’s display using the camera mounted {{on the front of}} the phone; more specifically, machine learning algorithms are used to: i) track the eye and infer its position on the mobile phone display as a user views a particular application; and ii) detect eye blinks that emulate mouse clicks to activate the target application under view. We present a prototype implementation of <b>EyePhone</b> on a Nokia N 810, which is capable of tracking the position of the eye on the display, mapping this positions to an application that is activated by a wink. At no time does the user have to physically touch the phone display. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new off-line programming {{system based on}} Virtual Reality techniques. 3 D data will be taken of a scene and presents this information as a stereoscopic computer generated images to a user equipped with an <b>eyephone.</b> The head movements are tracked by sensors and the image is updated accordingly in real-time. Sensors also track hand and finger movements, allowing 3 D input from the user {{in a way which}} is not possible with traditional interfaces such as keyboard, mouse or joystick...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of special populations such as pre-school children and Down syndrome kids in crisis and their distorted self-image were never studied before, {{because of the}} difficulty of crisis reproduction. This study proposes a VR setting that tries to model some special population's behaviour in the time of crises and offers them a training scenario. The sample population consisted of 30 pre-school children and 20 children with Down syndrome. The VR setting involved a high-speed PC, a VPL <b>EyePhone</b> 1, a MR toolkit, a vibrations plate, a motion capture system and other sensors. The system measured and modelled the typical behaviour of these special populations in a Virtual Earthquake scenario with sight and sound and calculated a VR anthropomorphic model that reproduced their behaviour and emotional state. Afterwards one group received an emotionally enhanced VR self-image as feedback for their training, one group received a plain VR self-image and another group received verbal instructions. The findings strongly suggest that the training was a lot more biased by the emotionally enhanced VR self-image than the other approaches. These findings could highlight the special role of the self-image to therapy and training and the interesting role of imagination to emotions, motives and learning. Further studies could be done with various scenarios in order to measure the best-biased behaviour and establish the most natural and affective VR model. This presentation is going to highlight the main findings and some theories behind them...|$|E
