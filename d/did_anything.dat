5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

25|$|The main {{case against}} the 'faked death' theory is that, whilst there is {{evidence}} for Marlowe's death, there is no equally unequivocal counter-evidence that he survived, or <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> more than exert a considerable influence on Shakespeare.

25|$|But {{the other}} {{dream of the}} Stelo {{retaining}} a constant value was almost forgotten except among the very old Universal League members.

25|$|The {{bomb that}} Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A {{follow-up}} attempt also failed.

Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however {{he was in a}} French prison (again, on narcotics charges) {{at the time of the}} attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks.

25|$|When {{informed}} {{of the division of}} the Roman army, Hannibal reconsidered his strategic position and studied the possibility of destroying part of the Roman army in a pitched battle. The Roman armies were camped separately, so one army could be drawn out and engaged under favorable conditions before the other could intervene. It was a foregone conclusion that Minucius was more likely to swallow whatever bait laid out by Hannibal, as Fabius had shown himself to be immune to all forms of Punic provocations throughout the summer of 217 BC. So, it became a question of getting Minucius to fight before Fabius <b>did</b> <b>anything,</b> not fighting Fabius before Minucius hightailed to the rescue. Hannibal's next challenge was to formulate a plan to entrap and destroy the Roman army commanded by Minucius. After a careful study of the terrain, Hannibal devised a tactical plan which would take advantage of the aggressiveness of Minucius and the geographical features of the chosen battle site. The plan was to entice Minucius with a careful and timed maneuver into thinking that he was fighting a repeat of the skirmish he had earlier fought at Geronium, while springing a trap similar to the one Hannibal had sprung on the Romans at the Battle of Trebbia in 218 BC on the unsuspecting army of Minucius. It had been suggested that Hannibal had deliberately lost the skirmish on purpose to obtain this very opportunity, but that speculation seems a bit far-fetched.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the last}} match before the First Test on the same ground and was played in {{stifling}} heat and humidity. Peter May captained again to give Hutton a rest. Ron Archer, captain of Queensland (the brother of the Australian all-rounder Ken Archer) won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a good wicket. Reg Simpson opened with 136, but again only two batsman <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> as Denis Compton added 110 runs and everybody else 56. The tourists were 18/3 before the 234 run Simpson-Compton partnership and collapsed from 252/4 to 304 all out thereafter. Ray Lindwall took 4/66, but had to retire because of gastric trouble. Strangely every batsman in the Queensland team except the absent Lindwall got into double figures, {{but none of them}} made fifty and they were out for 288. Mick Harvey made 49 and thrashed a ball into Jim McConnon's groin, a painful injury that put the unlucky spinner out of contention for weeks. Alex Bedser still had his unexplained rash, but bowled 31 eight ball overs for 2/56 and Brian Statham and Trevor Bailey both took 3/74. The MCC made 288 as well in their second innings despite being 8/2 when the makeshift opener Colin Cowdrey and wicket-keeper Keith Andrew batting at number 3 were out for ducks. Simpson made 38, but it was May (77), Compton (69) and Bailey (51 not out) who made the runs as no bowler took more than 2 wickets. There was no time to consider a run chase, but Simpson surprised everybody when his off-spinners took 2/5 to leave Queensland on 25/2.|$|E
25|$|At the Tour of Britain, {{the final}} major event before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships, Cavendish {{made his first}} {{appearance}} at his 'home' race since 2007. It {{was part of his}} plan to be at peak form before worlds. He was immediately successful. He and leadout man Renshaw were so convincingly the best in the stage 1 sprint that the leadout man finished in second place right behind his sprinter, much like they had in the Champs-Élysées stage at the 2009 Tour de France. Their positions were reversed in the stage 5 sprint, as Renshaw took victory ahead of Cavendish. It was unclear whether Cavendish intentionally gifted the stage to his longtime leadout man, though Renshaw acknowledged afterward that Cavendish was definitely not giving a full effort. The news on the day for the tam was not all good, as Rasmussen was pulled from the event and had his contract terminated due to news that he had missed three doping controls. Rasmussen was later exonerated due to a procedural error {{on the part of the}} UCI. Undeterred, Cavendish closed out the Tour of Britain by winning the very short road race stage into London on its final day. Renshaw, again, took second place, perhaps proving himself the better of each other team's primary sprinter. In October, as the team's time together was winding down, Martin debuted his newly-won world championship rainbow jersey in the stage 1 time trial at the inaugural Tour of Beijing. None of the race's subsequent stages <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> to dislodge the German from the top of the overall standings, making him the first overall winner of the new event.|$|E

25|$|Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, {{his first}} ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, {{but failed to}} {{dislodge}} the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 {{so far in the}} season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a slip and O'Neill hooked to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling - he rarely <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> else - and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead {{by the end of the}} fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he didn't want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.|$|E

[...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy.
