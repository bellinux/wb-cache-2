Murphy fought at Montélimar, and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near Cleurie in northeastern France in October.|$|E

In recent years, the management level of enterprises in China <b>falsifies</b> financial statements by all methods to conceal the real financial conditions, business operations, and cash flows, with different aims.

5|$|As {{the weather}} warmed and work resumed {{on the main}} pipeline, Alyeska administrators were distracted by a {{controversy}} about pipeline welds {{that had been done}} the previous year. In September 1975, a former employee of Ketchbaw Industries filed suit against the company, alleging that he had been laid off because he would not participate in a conspiracy to <b>falsify</b> quality control X-Rays of pipeline welds. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline was unique among pipeline projects to that point in that it required all welds of the main pipeline to be verified by X-Ray. This was a time-consuming process, and the quality-control procedures continually lagged behind the welders.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's {{doctor on}} board the Demodocus, a steam liner {{ferrying}} supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), but had to <b>falsify</b> his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering them from a Kuomintang officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could <b>falsify</b> proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

50|$|In {{place of}} naïve falsification, Popper envisioned science as {{progressing}} by the successive rejection of <b>falsified</b> theories, rather than <b>falsified</b> statements. <b>Falsified</b> theories {{are to be}} replaced by theories that can account for the phenomena that <b>falsified</b> the prior theory, that is, with greater explanatory power. For example, Aristotelian mechanics explained observations of everyday situations, but were <b>falsified</b> by Galileo's experiments, and were replaced by Newtonian mechanics, which accounted for the phenomena noted by Galileo (and others). Newtonian mechanics' reach included the observed motion of the planets and the mechanics of gases. The Youngian wave theory of light (i.e., waves carried by the luminiferous aether) replaced Newton's (and many of the Classical Greeks') particles of light but in turn was <b>falsified</b> by the Michelson-Morley experiment and was superseded by Maxwell's electrodynamics and Einstein's special relativity, which did account for the newly observed phenomena. Furthermore, Newtonian mechanics applied to the atomic scale was replaced with quantum mechanics, when the old theory could not provide an answer to the ultraviolet catastrophe, the Gibbs paradox, or how electron orbits could exist without the particles radiating away their energy and spiraling towards the centre. Thus the new theory had to posit the existence of unintuitive concepts such as energy levels, quanta and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{is one of}} the most regulated industries in the world. While legislation is necessary to protect patients, too much legislation is said to hamper innovation and increase medicine prices. Using qualitative methods such as interviews and document analysis, we investigated the role of private stakeholders in the EU policymakers’ decision to initiate legislation to combat <b>falsified</b> medicines in 2008. Our results show that the {{pharmaceutical industry}}, brand owners in particular, were strong proponents of legislation to combat <b>falsified</b> medicines. Their support was not fueled by fear that <b>falsified</b> medicines would harm patients or their own business, but rather because legislative action in this area would advance policies that benefit their businesses objectives. The brand owners framed the issue to policymakers as best to support their business objectives. In general, supply chain actors lobbied for stricter requirements in order to challenge competitors. In the end, the <b>Falsified</b> Medicines Directive may have suffered from company influence not by addressing the primary problem of <b>falsified</b> medicines, but rather by creating additional legislation that benefits the supply chain actors...|$|R
