5|$|Together {{with the}} Diplodocidae and the Rebbachisauridae, the Dicraeosauridae is nested inside the Diplodocoidea. All {{members of the}} Diplodocoidea are {{characterized}} by their box-shaped snout and narrow teeth restricted to the foremost portion of the jaws. Both the Dicraeosauridae and the Diplodocidae are characterized by bifurcated neural spines of the cervical and <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> In the Dicraeosauridae, the bifurcated neural spines were strongly elongated, a trend reaching its extreme in Amargasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of {{vertebra}} Marsh first {{thought to be a}} mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
5|$|The neck {{consisted}} of nine cervical vertebrae, {{which would have}} formed an S-shaped curve, {{as indicated by the}} shape of the vertebral bodies in the side view of the skeleton. The vertebral bodies of the anterior cervical vertebrae are shaped like a parallelogram, those of the middle are rectangular and those of the posterior show a trapezoid shape. The trunk was short, consisting of 12 dorsal and 6 fused sacral vertebrae. The tail was long compared to the body; although incompletely known, it probably {{consisted of}} 34 to 37 caudal vertebrae. The dorsal spine was stiffened by ossified tendons, beginning with the fourth <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> This feature is present in many other ornithischian dinosaurs and probably countered stress caused by bending forces acting on the spine during bipedal locomotion. In contrast to many other ornithischians, the tail of Heterodontosaurus lacked ossified tendons, and was therefore probably flexible. It had a long, narrow pelvis and a pubis which resembled those possessed by more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
25|$|Parts of six <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are preserved: one partial {{anterior}} dorsal vertebral neural arch, one partial dorsal vertebral centrum, three posterior <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> {{that are}} nearly complete but currently heavily reconstructed with plaster, {{and one that}} has been plastered into the sacrum. None of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> have observable neurocentral sutures.|$|R
25|$|The {{fourteen}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are weakly amphicoelous, or concave on both ends, {{typical of}} basal sauropodomorphs. Also typical {{is the presence}} of blade-like keels on the undersides of the first to third <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which are not seen elsewhere; additionally, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> near the front have the typical low, short, and somewhat plate-like neural spines. Unusually, however, the same kinds of neural spines are also seen in the last three <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which is only otherwise seen in basal saurischians like Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor. In the middle and back <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the top back corner of the neural spines project outward to produce a concave back edge, which is seen in some other basal sauropodomorphs but not Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, Yunnanosaurus, and Riojasaurus.|$|R

25|$|A nearly {{complete}} sacrum consisting of six vertebrae was {{recovered from the}} quarry, originally only lacking some ribs. The original description of Huabeisaurus suggested that only five sacral vertebrae were present {{based on the number}} of sacral ribs and intercostal foramina. The sacrum is currently heavily restored with plaster, but pre-restoration photographs show the sacrum in two oblique dorsal views and right lateral view. These photographs reveal that the last <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> was taphonomically shifted posteriorly and to the right, crushing the right first sacral rib. Pre-restoration photographs and the number of broken sacral neural spines currently visible indicate that the sacrum was composed of at least six vertebrae. The first vertebra crushed into the sacrum could represent a seventh sacral vertebra; because the ribs of this <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> are not observable firsthand or in photographs, but it cannot be verified whether or not these ribs contacted the ilium. The vertebra was interpreted as the last <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> because: its neural spine does not appear to be fused to the neural spine posterior to it, and the usual sacral vertebral count for all but the most basal somphospondylans is six (with seven vertebrae in Neuquensaurus as the only derived exception).|$|E
25|$|Just {{behind the}} presumed {{position}} of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that {{has been identified as}} the duodenum. It is preserved partly {{in the form of a}} natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the cellular structure, including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the back. There in a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the jejunum. This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column — or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The jejunum seems to blend with an exceptionally short ileum. A contraction below the thirteenth <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} tract can mostly be traced, either because the intestines are still present {{or by the}} presence of food items. The position of the oesophagus is indicated by a five millimetre long series of small food particles. Below the ninth <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> the location of the stomach is shown by a cluster of bones of prey animals, the organ itself likely having been dissolved by its own stomach acid shortly after death. The rather backward position of the cluster suggests the stomach was dual in structure, with a forward enzyme-secreting proventriculus preceding a muscular gizzard. Gastroliths have not been reported.|$|E
50|$|Authentic {{traits of}} Talarurus include <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> with {{transversely}} broad hypapophyses, swellings {{of the lower}} front centrum rims. There is a sacral rod of four rear <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> connected to the true sacrum consisting of four sacrals and a caudo-sacral. The tail club of the mount is rather small.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} titanosauriforms, the {{internal}} {{texture of the}} vertebrae is pneumatized by many small holes (camellate), and the dorsal ribs also bear pneumatic cavities. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> have ridges {{on the sides of}} their bottom faces as in Diamantinasaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia, but Savannasaurus lacks the keel {{on the bottom of the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> as in these species; the dorsal neural spines are also not split into two, unlike Opisthocoelicaudia. The known cervical <b>vertebrae</b> and <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are opisthocoelous, while all of the caudal vertebrae are amphicoelous unlike most other titanosaurs.|$|R
5000|$|Overosaurus {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Rodolfo A. Coria, Leonardo S. Filippi, Luis M. Chiappe, Rodolfo García and Andrea B. Arcucci in 2013. This species is known solely from the holotype MAU-Pv-CO-439 {{which consists of}} a fully articulated vertebral series from the 10th cervical to the 20th caudal vertebra, the ribs {{of the last three}} cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> six right <b>dorsal</b> ribs (articulated with their respective <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> 2,3,4,5,8,9), five left dorsal ribs (articulated with their respective <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> 2,3,4,5,8), the proximal portions of dorsal ribs of both sides of <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> 9 and 10, a complete right ilium and a fragmented left ilium. Specifically the vertebral series includes the last four cervical <b>vertebrae,</b> ten <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> six sacral vertebrae, and twenty caudal vertebrae. Its sacrum consists of six fused sacral vertebrae.|$|R
25|$|In {{the grey}} organic mass {{at the neck}} base, muscle fibres are present that have been {{identified}} as belonging to the Musculus sternohyoideus and the Musculus sternotrachealis. Between the sixth and seventh <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> a patch of muscle fibres is visible belonging to either the Musculus transversospinalis or the Musculus longissimus dorsi. In front of the right ischium muscle fibres are present running from the ischial foot {{in the direction of the}} femur. Their identity is uncertain: they could belong to the Musculus puboischiofemoralis pars medialis (the Musculus adductor femoris I of crocodiles) but in that case this muscle with (some) non-avian theropods would not be anchored on the obturator process. The fibres could also represent an unknown muscle. In any case they refute a conjecture by Gregory S. Paul that there would be no muscle connection between the ischium and the femur at all. Above the rectum tract a large area of horizontal unsegmented muscle fibres is present, probably representing the unsegmented Musculus caudofemoralis longus of the tail base, the main retractor muscle operating on the thighbone. These fibres are polygonal in cross-section and show the intercellular spaces also. Below some tail base vertebrae the connective ligaments between the chevrons are present, forming the ligmamentum interhaemale, but also some small muscle fibres and some mysterious hollow tubes arranged in a herringbone pattern; the latter perhaps represent the myosepta of the myotomes, the segments of the Musculus iliocaudalis or the Musculus ischiocaudalis.|$|E
500|$|Neural spines {{from the}} [...] <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> to the {{foremost}} tail vertebrae also were strongly elongated, but different in structure, forming a single row of paddle-shaped projections. According to Bailey, these projections resembled those of modern humped ungulates {{such as the}} bison, indicating {{the presence of a}} fleshy hump above the hips. Bailey suggested similar humps for other dinosaurs with strongly elongated neural spines, such as Spinosaurus and Ouranosaurus.|$|E
500|$|Producing an {{estimate}} of the complete size of A. fragillimus requires scaling the bones of better-known species of diplodocid (a family of extremely long and slender sauropods) in the assumption that their relative proportions were similar. In his original paper, Cope did this by speculating on the size of a hypothetical A. fragillimus femur (upper leg bone). Cope noticed that in other sauropod dinosaurs, specifically A. altus and Camarasaurus supremus, the femora were always twice as tall as the tallest <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> and estimated the size of an A. fragillimus femur to be [...] tall.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (OMNH) had {{recovered}} remains {{belonging to the}} same hadrosauroid from excavations in the southwestern region of the Swell. Specimens discovered by the OMNH initially consisted of six individuals from five localities: two juvenile skeletons, including vertebrae, scapulae, an ulna, an ilium and ischium, and hindlimb elements from locality OMNH v237; a partial juvenile skeleton, including parts of the skull, forelimbs, and hindlimbs along with a <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> from [...] OMNH v824; OMNH 27749, a sacrum and ischium from [...] OMNH v696; OMNH 24389, an ischium from OMNH v214; and OMNH 32812, a partial skeleton including a scapula, two caudal vertebrae, and other unexcavated elements from OMNH v866. The OMNH also made further discoveries of the hadrosauroid's teeth in various quarries. Richard Cifelli of the OMNH allowed James Kirkland to study the collected specimens. Kirkland went on to preliminarily describe the specimens in 1994 in a conference abstract {{at the annual meeting}} of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.|$|E

60|$|There {{are seven}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never anchylosed with the succeeding four, which are generally anchylosed together. In one Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal vertebrae were free. In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free; generally the sixth is free (as in G. bankiva), but sometimes only at its posterior end, where {{in contact with}} the seventh. The seventh <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> in every case excepting in one Spanish cock, was anchylosed with the lumbar vertebrae.

The hypapophysis of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> varies much in development; being sometimes (as in several, but not all Tumblers) nearly as prominent {{as that of the}} third dorsal vertebra; and the two hypapophyses together tend to form an ossified arch. The development of the arch, formed by the hypapophyses of the third and fourth dorsal vertebrae, also varies considerably, as does the size of the hypapophysis of the fifth vertebra.|$|E

60|$|In G. bankiva {{there are}} {{fourteen}} cervical, seven dorsal with ribs, apparently fifteen lumbar and sacral, and six caudal vertebrae (7/71. It appears that I have not correctly designated the several groups of vertebrae, {{for a great}} authority, Mr. W.K. Parker ('Transact. Zoolog. Soc.' volume 5 page 198) specifies 16 cervical, 4 dorsal, 15 lumbar, and 6 caudal vertebrae in this genus. But I have used the same terms in all the following descriptions.); but the lumbar and sacral are so much anchylosed that I am not sure of their number, and this makes the comparison {{of the total number}} of vertebrae in the several breeds difficult. I have spoken of six caudal vertebrae, because the basal one is almost completely anchylosed with the pelvis; but if we consider the number as seven, the caudal vertebrae agree in all the skeletons. The cervical vertebrae are, as just stated, in appearance fourteen; but out of twenty-three skeletons in a fit state for examination, in five of them, namely, in two Games, in two pencilled Hamburghs, and in a Polish, the fourteenth vertebra bore ribs, which, though small, were perfectly developed with a double articulation. The presence of these little ribs cannot be considered as a fact of much importance, for all the cervical vertebrae bear representatives of ribs; but their development in the fourteenth vertebra reduces the size of the passages in the transverse processes, and makes this vertebra exactly like the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> The addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone, for properly the ribs of the first true <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> are destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs the first pair of true ribs had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine, and the swan twenty-three cervical vertebrae (7/72. Macgillivray 'British Birds' volume 1 page 25.), we need feel no surprise at the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being, as it appears, variable.|$|E
60|$|In one {{skeleton}} of the Labrador duck {{there were the}} usual fifteen cervical vertebrae and the usual nine dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; in the other skeleton there were fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae with ribs; nor, as far as could be judged, was this owing merely to a rib having been developed on the first lumbar vertebra; for in both skeletons the lumbar vertebrae agreed perfectly in number, shape, and size {{with those of the}} wild duck. In two skeletons of the Call duck there were fifteen cervical and nine dorsal vertebrae; in a third skeleton small ribs were attached to the so-called fifteenth cervical vertebra, making ten pairs of ribs; but these ten ribs do not correspond, or arise from the same vertebra, with the ten in the above-mentioned Labrador duck. In the Call duck, which had small ribs attached to the fifteenth cervical vertebra, the haemal spines of the thirteenth and fourteenth (cervical) and of the seventeenth (dorsal) vertebrae corresponded with the spines on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth vertebrae of the wild duck: so that each of these vertebrae had acquired a structure proper to one posterior to it in position. In the eighth cervical vertebra of this same Call duck (figure 40, B), the two branches of the haemal spine stand much closer together than in the wild duck (A), and the descending haemal processes are much shortened. In the Penguin duck the neck from its thinness and erectness falsely appears (as ascertained by measurement) to be much elongated, but the cervical and dorsal vertebrae present no difference; the posterior dorsal vertebrae, however, are more completely anchylosed to the pelvis than in the wild duck. The Aylesbury duck has fifteen cervical and ten dorsal vertebrae furnished with ribs, but the same number of lumbar, sacral, and caudal vertebrae, as far as could be traced, as in the wild duck. The cervical vertebrae in this same duck (figure 40, D) were much broader and thicker relatively to their length than in the wild (C); so much so, that I have thought it worth while to give a sketch of the twelfth cervical vertebra in these two birds. From the foregoing statements we see that the fifteenth cervical vertebra occasionally becomes modified into a <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> and when this occurs all the adjoining vertebrae are modified. We also see that an additional <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> bearing a rib is occasionally developed, the number of the cervical and lumbar vertebrae apparently remaining the same as usual.|$|E
60|$|Seven is {{the normal}} number of true ribs, but in two skeletons of the Sultan fowl (in which the fourteenth {{cervical}} vertebra was not furnished with little ribs) {{there were eight}} pairs; the eighth pair seemed to be developed on a vertebra corresponding with the first lumbar in G. bankiva; the sternal portion of both the seventh and eighth ribs did not reach the sternum. In four skeletons in which ribs were developed on the fourteenth cervical vertebra, there were, when these cervical ribs are included, eight pairs; but in one Game cock, in which the fourteenth cervical was furnished with ribs, there were only six pairs of true dorsal ribs; the sixth pair in this case did not have processes, and thus resembled the seventh pair in other skeletons; in this Game cock, as far as could be judged from {{the appearance of the}} lumbar vertebrae, a whole <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebra</b> with its ribs was missing. We thus see that the ribs (whether or not the little pair attached to the fourteenth cervical vertebra be counted) vary from six to eight pair. The sixth pair is frequently not furnished with processes. The sternal portion of the seventh pair is extremely broad in Cochins, and is completely ossified. As previously stated, it is scarcely possible to count the lumbo-sacral vertebrae; but they certainly do not correspond in shape or number in the several skeletons. The caudal vertebrae are closely similar in all the skeletons, the only difference being whether or not the basal one is anchylosed to the pelvis; they hardly vary even in length, not being shorter in Cochins, with their short tail-feathers, than in other breeds; in a Spanish cock, however, the caudal vertebrae were a little elongated. In three rumpless fowls the caudal vertebrae were few in number, and anchylosed together into a misformed mass.|$|E
50|$|On the <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> the {{accessory}} articulations {{known as the}} hyposphene-hypantrum articulations are well-developed. Like other aphanosaurians, there are pits located {{on the side of}} the base of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Two vertebrae are associated with the sacrum in Teleocrater; there are three such vertebrae in Nyasasaurus. The ribs associated with the latter sacral vertebra bear processes that project backward and outward, which is only otherwise seen in Yarasuchus, Spondylosoma, and members of the dinosauriforms. There were no bony osteoderms preserved in association with the specimen, which indicates that Teleocrater probably lacked osteoderms, unlike pseudosuchians.|$|R
