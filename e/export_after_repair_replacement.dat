40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to compare mitral valve <b>repair</b> and <b>replacement</b> as treatments for ischemic mitral regurgitation. Methods: From 1985 through 1997, {{a total of}} 482 patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation underwent either valve repair (n = 397) or valve replacement (n = 85). Patients more likely (P ≤. 01) to undergo repair had functional mitral regurgitation or coronary revascularization with an internal thoracic artery graft; those more likely to receive valve replacement were in higher New York Heart Association functional classes or underwent emergency operations. These factors were used for multivariable propensity matching. Risk factors for early and late death were identified by multivariable, multiphase hazard function analysis. Results: Within the propensity-matched better-risk group, survivals after valve replacement were 81 %, 56 %, and 36 % at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years, but survivals <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> were 94 %, 82 %, and 58 % at these intervals (P =. 08). In contrast, within the poor-risk group, survivals <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> and <b>replacement</b> were similar (P =. 4). Risk factors (P ≤. 01) included older age, higher functional class, greater wall motion abnormality, and renal dysfunction. Approximately 70 % of patients were predicted to benefit from repair; the benefit lessened or was negated if an internal thoracic artery graft was not used, if a lateral wall motion abnormality was present, or if the mitral regurgitation jet pattern was complex. Freedom from repair failure at 5 years was 91 %. Conclusion: Late survival is poor after surgery for ischemic mitral regurgitation. Most patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation benefit from mitral valve repair. In the most complex, high-risk settings, survivals <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> and <b>replacement</b> are similar...|$|R

40|$|Rigid {{endoscopes}} degrade during {{clinical use}} due to sterilization, ionizing radiation and mechanical forces. Despite visual checks on functionality {{at the department}} of sterilization, surgeons are still confronted with suboptimal instruments as it is difficult to assess this degradation in an objective manner. To guarantee that endoscopes have sufficient optical quality for minimal invasive surgery, an experimental opto-electronic test bench has been developed in order to be used {{at the department of}} sterilization. Transmission of illumination fibres and lens contrast values are stored in a database to enable empirical criteria to reject endoscope for further clinical usage or to accept endoscopes <b>after</b> <b>repair.</b> Results of the test bench are given for an eight month period, where a trained operator performed 1599 measurements on 46 different types. Stability of the system, trends in quality of clinical endoscopes, and effect of <b>repair</b> or <b>replacement</b> were assessed. Although the period was too short to draw firm conclusions, a slow downwards trend in quality of clinically used endoscopes could be observed. Also, endoscopes generally improve in quality <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> or <b>replacement,</b> while endoscope replacement seems to slightly outperform endoscope repair. To optimize the measurement process, a new system is being developed requiring less user interaction and measuring more optical parameters of an endoscope. By commercializing this system, we hope that measurements at different hospitals will give improved insight which acceptance and rejection criteria to use and which factors (usage, cleaning protocol, and brands) determine the economic lifetime of endoscopes...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{world of}} the automation, it is {{impossible}} to survive without reliable systems. Thus, all the working engineering systems are expected to remain operative with the maximum efficiency for the maximum duration, i. e., reliable operation. The importance of reliable operation has been realized in large complex process industries such as chemical, sugar, textile, paper plants and fertilizer plants, etc. In these process plants to achieve the high availability and productivity, it is necessary that all systems/subsystems remain in upstate for a longer duration of time. However, these systems/subsystems are subjected to random failures due to poor design, lack of operative skills and wrong manufacturing techniques, etc., causing heavy production losses. These failed systems can be brought back to their operating states <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> or <b>replacement</b> in minimum possible down time. The plant working conditions and the repair strategies {{play an important role in}} maintaining the operating systems, operative for maximum duration, i. e., optimal system availability. This can be accomplished only through performance evaluation and analysis of all the operating systems of the plant. The system performance can be quantified in terms of the availability if the operating system is modelled mathematically and analysed in real working conditions. It can be further optimized by means of some advanced optimization techniques...|$|R

40|$|Reconstruction or {{repair of}} ligaments and tendons to bone, {{following}} injury, to improve joint function {{is a very}} common surgical procedure in orthopedics. The most common surgical ligament reconstruction in humans is anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Because ACL is not amenable to <b>repair</b> <b>after</b> tear, <b>replacement</b> of the ligament using autograft or allograft tissue is currently the treatment of choice for young and active patients. On the other hand, surgical reattachment to bone is the most reliable treatment in case of rotator cuff tendon tears. Tendon grafting or repair to bone is performed during hand, foot, and ankle surgery. Nowadays, ACL reconstruction and repair of rotator cuff tendon tears are the most commonly performed surgical procedures for soft tissue injuries in orthopedics. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

We investigated {{the effect of}} the immunosuppressant FK 506, a macrolide antibiotic demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia models, in a rat model of transient spinal cord ischemia. Spinal cord ischemia was induced in anesthetized rats by using direct aortic arch plus left subclavian artery cross-clamping through a limited thoracotomy. Experimental groups were as follows: sham-operation; control, receiving only vehicle; FK 506 A, receiving FK 506 (1 mg/kg IV) before clamping; and FK 506 B, receiving FK 506 (1 mg/kg IV) at the onset of reperfusion. Neurologic status was assessed at 24 h and then daily up to 96 h witha 0 to 6 scale (0, normal function; 6, severe paraplegia). Rats were randomly killed at 24, 48, or 96 h, and spinal cords were harvested for histopathology. Physiologic variables did not differ significantly among experimental groups. All control rats suffered severe and definitive paraplegia. FK 506 -treated rats had significantly better neurologic outcome compared with control. Histopathologic analysis disclosed severe injury in the lumbar gray matter of all control rats, whereas most FK 506 -treated rats had less injury. These data suggest that FK 506 can improve neurologic recovery and attenuate spinal cord injury induced by transient thoracic aortic cross-clamping. (Anesth Analg 2001; 92 : 1237 – 44) Spinal cord ischemia with resulting paraplegia is a devastating complication <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> or <b>replacement</b> of the thoracoabdominal aorta (1, 2).

We evaluated our late outcomes <b>after</b> mitral <b>repair</b> and <b>replacement</b> for rheumatic disease. Methods: Five hundred seventy-three patients underwent mitral valve surgery for rheumatic disease at our institution from 1978 - 1995. Follow-up was 98 % complete (mean, 68 ± 46 months). Survival and morbidity were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression, including propensity score analysis. Results: Mean age was 54 ± 14 years, 55 % of patients had congestive heart failure, 22 % were undergoing redo mitral valve surgery, and 9 % also underwent coronary bypass. Mitral stenosis was present in 53 %, regurgitation in 15 %, and both in 32 %. Valve repair was performed in 25 %, bioprosthetic replacement was performed in 28 %, and a mechanical valve was placed in 47 %. Patients undergoing repair were younger {{and less likely to}} be undergoing reoperation or to have atrial fibrillation than those undergoing replacement (P =. 001). The operative mortality rate was 4. 2 %. Better late cardiac survival was independently predicted by valve <b>repair</b> rather than <b>replacement</b> (P =. 04) after adjustment for baseline differences between patients. Freedom from reoperation was greatest (P =. 005) but that from thromboembolic complications was worst (P <. 0001) after mechanical valve replacement. Twenty-three patients underwent reoperation <b>after</b> initial <b>repair,</b> with no operative deaths. Conclusions: Mechanical valves minimize reoperation but limit survival and increase thromboembolic complications. Patients undergoing valve repair had improved late cardiac survival independent of their preoperative characteristics. Rheumatic mitral valves should be repaired when {{technically feasible}}, accepting a risk of reoperation, to maximize survival and reduce morbidity.

50|$|For {{the first}} seven years, the CMK was used mostly for freight traffic. In 1980, the line carried 73 freight trains and only 4 {{passenger}} trains daily. This changed in the mid-1980s, when the government in Warsaw decided to {{open the line to}} more passenger trains. On 1 June 1984 the first express trains (Górnik, from Warszawa Wschodnia to Gliwice, and Krakus, from Warszawa Wschodnia to Kraków Główny) began traveling on the CMK, with speed of up to 140 km/h. Two years later the maximum speed was raised to 160 km/h. The CMK, however, was designed for speeds of up to 250 km/h, and <b>after</b> several <b>repairs</b> and <b>replacement</b> of tracks, on 11 May 1994, an Italian Pendolino train reached the speed of 250.1 km/h (near Biała Rawska), which remained the speed record for train travel in Mid-Eastern Europe until November 2013. This single achievement, however, did not mean that trains began regular services with speeds of up to 250 km/h. Before 2009 the Polish State Railways owned no rolling stock capable of such speeds, and numerous improvements in the infrastructure would be required. The CMK line also lacked cab signalling which is required on high-speed rail lines, where trains travel at speeds which make observation of lineside signals unreliable.|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} surgery in {{patients}} with mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) continues to elicit uncertainty and considerable controversy. Some patients will incur myocardial structural changes, pulmonary hypertension, or arrhythmias before they manifest symptoms, with the risk that these adverse endpoints will not be reversible <b>after</b> valve <b>repair</b> or <b>replacement.</b> Imaging to assess valve morphology, severity of regurgitation, and left ventricular (LV) volume and function is firmly established, and the guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology support this approach. However, with improvement in surgical technique and outcomes, there is momentum toward earlier intervention before patients reach class I indications of symptoms or LV systolic dysfunction, particularly {{in patients with}} degenerative MR who are candidates for mitral repair. In expert centers, mitral valve repair is achieved at low risk and with excellent long-term durability of repair, returning patients to a lifespan equivalent {{to that of the}} normal population. In AR, decision making is more complex because patients almost invariably require valve replacement. Prospective clinical trials are needed to provide the evidence base for more objective decisions regarding timing of surgery. Biomarkers and new methods to assess interstitial fibrosis and regional myocardial function have also evolved for clinical investigation and hold the promise of enhanced determination of those in whom early surgical intervention is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Background—Mitral {{regurgitation}} (MR) due to {{mitral valve}} prolapse (MVP) is often treatable by surgical repair. However, the very long-term (. 10 -year) durability of repair in both anterior leaflet prolapse (AL-MVP) and posterior leaflet prolapse (PL-MVP) is unknown. Methods and Results—In 917 patients (aged 65613 years, 68 % male), surgical correction of severe isolated MR due to MVP (679 <b>repairs</b> and 238 <b>replacements</b> [MVRs]) was performed between 1980 and 1995. Survival <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> was better than survival after MVR for both PL-MVP (at 15 years, 4165 % versus 3166 %, respectively; P 50. 0003) and AL-MVP (at 14 years, 4268 % versus 3165 %, respectively; P 50. 003). In multivariate analysis adjusting for predictors of survival, repair was independently associated with lower mortality in PL-MVP (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 44 to 0. 85; P 50. 0034) and in AL-MVP (adjusted RR 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 47 to 0. 96; P 50. 028). The reoperation rate was not different <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> or MVR overall (at 19 years, 2065 % for repair versus 2365 % for MVR; P 50. 4) or separately in PL-MVP (P 50. 3) or AL-MVP (P 50. 3). However, the reoperation rate was higher <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> of AL-MVP than <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> of PL-MVP (at 15 years, 2867 % versus 1163 %, respectively; P 50. 0006). From the 1980 s to the 1990 s, the RR of reoperation <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> of AL-MVP versus PL-MVP did not change (RR 2. 5 versus 2. 7, respectively; P 50. 58), but the absolute rate of reoperation decreased similarly in PL-MVP and AL-MVP (at 10 years, from 1063 % to 562 % and from 2466 % to 1062 %, respectively; P 50. 04) ...|$|R

MethodsWe reviewed medical records of patients aged 18 years or older undergoing bicuspid aortic valve repair for aortic regurgitation from 1984 through 2007. We analyzed early outcomes and predictors of aortic valve <b>replacement</b> <b>after</b> initial <b>repair.</b> Patients with repair were compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort who had replacement with a bioprosthesis. Overall survival and survival free from reoperations were compared between groups. ResultsThe mean follow-up period for 108 consecutive patients with repair was 5. 1 (standard deviation, 4. 1) years. The initially repaired valve was subsequently replaced in 19 (18 %) patients. No bicuspid aortic valve repair technique or morphologic characteristic included in univariate risk factor analysis was associated with increased probability of <b>replacement</b> <b>after</b> initial <b>repair.</b> The 5 - and 10 -year survival rates <b>after</b> <b>repair</b> were 96 % and 87 %, respectively. Freedom from valve replacement was 96 %, 89 %, and 49 % at 1, 5, and 10 years <b>after</b> <b>repair,</b> respectively.
