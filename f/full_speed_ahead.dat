5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead.</b> Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5000|$|Ship {{navigation}} {{is controlled}} with the mouse. Players can set waypoints for the ship's course and attacks targets, Interaction is also featured, such as focusing the viewpoint on objects, initiating docking manoeuvres, firing tow-ropes and grappling hooks, and, when {{used on the}} player ship, activating the cloaking device (only available on the Procyon Submersible). In line with the [...] "classical nautical" [...] design of the ships and the universe in general, the speed control is designed {{to look like an}} engine order telegraph.

40|$|The {{influence}} of various parameters, such as ship initial <b>speed</b> (<b>full</b> <b>ahead</b> and lower engine loads), loading condition, heading angle and weather conditions on ship fuel consumption and CO 2 emission is presented. A reliable methodology for estimating the attainable ship speed, fuel consumption and CO 2 emission in different sea states is described. The speed loss is calculated by {{taking into account}} the engine and propeller performance in actual seas as well as the mass inertia of the ship. The attainable ship speed is obtained as time series. Correlation of speed loss with sea states allows predictions of propulsive performance in actual seas. If the computation is used for weather routing purposes, values for various ship initial speed, loading conditions and heading angles for each realistic sea‐state must be provided. The voluntary speed loss is taken into account. The {{influence of}} the ship speed loss on various parameters such as fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions is presented. To illustrate the presented concept, the ship speed and CO 2 emissions in various routes of the Atlantic Ocean are calculated using representative environmental design data for the track of the routes where the ship will sail...|$|R

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead</b> because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of April 29, 1903, a freight train pulled out of the mine and was slowly making its way towards the {{townsite}} when the crew heard a deafening rumble behind them. [...] The engineer instinctively set the throttle to <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead</b> and sped his train to safety across the bridge over the Crowsnest River.

500|$|In late September 1917, Worsley and the PC.61 were {{on patrol}} {{to the south}} of Ireland. On 26 September 1917, a nearby tanker was struck by a torpedo from a U-boat, [...] Observing the explosion, Worsley {{gradually}} slowed his propellers, hoping to deceive the U-boat's crew into thinking his P-boat was leaving the area and luring the submarine to the surface. [...] The deception was successful and the UC-33 surfaced, intending to sink the tanker with its deck gun. Worsley immediately ordered <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead</b> and, realising that he would lose time in manoeuvring his ship into a position in which she could use her guns, set a collision course with the U-boat, intending to ram the submarine. At high speeds the bow, to which the ram was fitted, of the PC.61 lifted out of the water considerably, and Worsley had to reduce speed at the right moment in order for it to be at the right height to strike the submarine. He timed the reduction of speed of the PC.61 perfectly and she struck the UC-33 midships as it was submerging. The submarine rapidly sunk with nearly all hands, the exception being the captain, who was rescued and later gifted Worsley a silver whistle. The damaged tanker was towed to Milford Haven in Wales, which took 12 hours in an area where other U-boats were known to be lurking.|$|E

500|$|As Baalham {{made his}} inspection, others {{observed}} {{the extent of}} the damage, and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread. With the ship's four pumps working at full capacity, Luce attempted to stanch the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship's bow. [...] This, he hoped, could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water, but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart. The ship's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials, but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached. Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking, Luce decided to run for the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat; Cape Race was about four hours distant, if the ship could be kept moving. This decision meant abandoning Vesta, but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment, and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate. After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew, who were being left to fend for themselves, Luce ordered <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead.</b> [...] A few minutes later, Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta. All but one of its dozen occupants were killed, mostly crushed under Arctics paddle wheels. [...] The single survivor was a fisherman, François Jassonet, who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope.|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} issues were RCA {{position}} on homosexuality, {{the adoption of}} the Belhar confession and complementarianism. Beyond the three reasons University Reformed Church mentioned: [...] "We have a deep desire to belong to a family of churches where who we are as a congregation fits squarely with what our denomination does and believes." [...] "We want to raise up pastors who do not fear that the ordination process is against them"."We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "We {{want to be in a}} denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, notsome extreme right flank". [...] "The denomination(RCA) has moved away from churches like ours." [...] "We want to work alongside churches that share our convictions." [...] "In practice, the RCA is already well down this path [...] and that given the way our classical structure works those who stand for biblical orthodoxy can do little to stop it. We believe laboring in such a mixed denomination undermines the true nature of biblical unity, hinders our witness for Christ, and does not represent the most effective avenue for ministry for URC in the years and decades ahead." [...] "URC would be able to serve with greater integrity and disciple our people (especially ministerial candidates) more effectively if we were in a denomination that shares our complementarian convictions, rather than in one that is moving <b>full</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ahead</b> in the other direction." [...] "We(URC) are troubled by the weak form of confessional subscription in the RCA, the process for examining ministerial candidates, and our formal ecumenical ties with liberal denominations like the UCC, ELCA and PCUSA". [...] "We have often heard from visitors that though they lived in Lansing for years they never thought to visit URC because it was an RCA church or because of things they had heard about liberal leanings in the RCA. How many others might be staying away because our denominational affiliation gives them the wrong idea about who we are and what we believe?"We do not recommend our RCA seminaries. [...] "We want to be in a denomination that sees us as occupying center ground, not some extreme right flank". [...] "The RCA connection inhibits interest in planting churches, the vision for training up pastors, and placement for new pastors." [...] "we also feel a measure of distance between us and most churches in the denomination".|$|E
