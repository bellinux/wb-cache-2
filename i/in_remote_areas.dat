40|$|Abstract: The project focuses {{to inform}} the {{condition}} of the patient to doctor <b>in</b> <b>remote</b> <b>area.</b> Often, <b>in</b> <b>remote</b> <b>area,</b> the responsibility of healthcare is handed over to a single doctor. It becomes difficult for a single doctor to monitor large number of patients. Also the patients face the challenge {{to inform the}}ir current heath condition to the doctor <b>in</b> the <b>remote</b> <b>area</b> where doctors are not easily made available. We are developing a web-based application to continuously monitor the patient and look after some of vital health parameters like Blood pressure, Heart rate and ECG of the patient. We use sensors such as ECG sensor, heart rate(pulse rate) sensor and blood pressure sensor to take their values respectively. The microcontroller calculates and performs operation on the values obtained from the sensor after sensing the patient with those sensors. The sensor sends the data over the internet to the sever. The processed data is then sent to the doctor side so that the doctor can draw a conclusion accordingly. The work can help to improve the medical health facility which is out of reach of the people living <b>in</b> <b>remote</b> <b>area.</b> Keywords:-Mobile Multi patient monitoring system, ATMEGA 16, ECG I...|$|R

5|$|Red deer have a stronghold on the moor {{and can be}} seen on quiet hillsides <b>in</b> <b>remote</b> <b>areas,</b> {{particularly}} in the early morning. The Emperor of Exmoor, a red stag (Cervus elaphus), was Britain's largest known wild land animal, until it was killed in October 2010. The moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include merlin, peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, European stonechat, dipper, Dartford warbler and ring ouzel. Black grouse and red grouse are now extinct on Exmoor, probably {{as a result of a}} reduction in habitat management, and for the former species, an increase in visitor pressure.|$|E

The current state of its population trend is unclear, as no natural historic or ecological investigation has been done on this species.

5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived <b>in</b> <b>remote</b> <b>areas</b> of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, he could find none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was really due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that they survived.|$|E
