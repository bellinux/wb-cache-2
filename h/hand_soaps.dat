25|$|A {{growing concern}} {{regarding}} plastic {{pollution in the}} marine ecosystem {{is the use of}} microplastics. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in <b>hand</b> <b>soaps,</b> face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants. These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.|$|E

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{has since been}} discovered to be common in all shear-thinning liquids (liquids which thin under shear stress). Common household liquids with this property are liquid <b>hand</b> <b>soaps,</b> shampoos and non-drip paint. The effect usually goes unnoticed, however, because it seldom lasts more than about 300 milliseconds. The effect can be sustained by pouring the liquid onto a slanted surface, preventing the outgoing jet from intersecting the downward one (which tends to end the effect).|$|E

50|$|Cocamide DEA, or cocamide diethanolamine, is a {{diethanolamide}} made by reacting {{the mixture}} of fatty acids from coconut oils with diethanolamine. It is a viscous liquid and {{is used as a}} foaming agent in bath products like shampoos and <b>hand</b> <b>soaps,</b> and in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent. See cocamide for the discussion of the lengths of carbon chains in the molecules in the mixture. The chemical formula of individual components is CH3(CH2)nC(=O)N(CH2CH2OH)2, where n typically ranges from 8 to 18.|$|E
50|$|Cocamidopropyl betaine {{is used as}} a foam booster in shampoos. It is {{a medium}} {{strength}} surfactant also used in bath products like <b>hand</b> <b>soaps.</b> It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce irritation purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an antistatic agent in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. It also has antiseptic properties, making it suitable for personal sanitary products. It is compatible with other cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{companies}} have replaced natural exfoliating ingredients with microplastics, {{usually in the}} form of [...] "microbeads" [...] or [...] "micro-exfoliates". These products are typically composed of polyethylene, a common component of plastics, but they can also be manufactured from polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and nylon. They are often found in face washes, <b>hand</b> <b>soaps,</b> and other such personal care products, so the beads are usually washed into the sewage system immediately after use. Their small size prevents them from being retained by preliminary treatment screens at wastewater plants, thereby allowing them to enter rivers and oceans.|$|E

50|$|Washing out {{mouth with}} soap {{is meant to}} be unpleasant, but is usually not {{intended}} to cause death or serious harm. Nonetheless, many people employ the aforementioned techniques with extremely limited knowledge regarding the safety of ingesting their chosen cleansing agents. Agents likely to cause serious harm if swallowed include many automatic dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents. Even ordinary bar soaps and liquid <b>hand</b> <b>soaps</b> may cause harmful effects including vomiting, diarrhea, irritation of the lining of the mouth and digestive tract, and in rare instances, pulmonary aspiration. This is especially true if these products are ingested in large quantities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{disinfectants}} TriGene, bleach, ethanol {{and liquid}} <b>hand</b> <b>soap,</b> {{and water and}} temperature were tested {{for their ability to}} kill bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, epimastigotes of Trypanosoma rangeli and promastigotes of Leishmania major. A 5 -min exposure to 0. 2 % TriGene, 0. 1 % liquid <b>hand</b> <b>soap</b> and 0. 05 % bleach (0. 05 % NaOCl) killed all three trypanosomatids. Ethanol and water destroyed the parasites within 5 min at concentrations of 15 – 17. 5 % and 80 – 90 %, respectively. All three organisms were also killed when treated for 5 min at 50 °C. The results indicate that the disinfectants, water and temperature treatment (i. e. autoclaving) are suitable laboratory hygiene measures against trypanosomatid parasites. </p...|$|R
