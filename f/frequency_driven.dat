Electromagnetic fields are excited in the cavity by coupling in an RF source with an antenna.

50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. Variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive.</b> For example, because the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed. The amount of energy that variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|R

Roughening of the surface and the creation of pinholes were observed when exposing poly- and nanocrystalline tungsten samples to low-flux plasma. A coating process using an excess of helium besides argon in the process gas mixture leads to a porous thin film and a granular surface structure whereas gas mixture ratios of up to 50 % He/Ar (in terms of their partial pressures) lead to a dense structure. The presence of helium in the deposited film was confirmed with glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy and thermal desorption measurements. Latter revealed that the highest fraction of the embedded helium atoms desorb at approximately 1500 K. Identical plasma treatments at various temperatures showed strongest modifications of the surface at 1500 K, which is attributed to the massive activation of helium singly bond to a single vacancy inside the film. Thus, an efficient way of preparing nanostructured tungsten surfaces and porous tungsten films at low fluxes was found...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} open-loop control and combined structural and control design (co-design) of very flexible beams is presented. The {{objective is to}} allow for an efficient design of these systems by identifying design strategies that provide significant performance advantages with respect to conventional sequential design methods. The control vector parametrisation method, implemented for both a B-splines (local) and discrete sines (global) set of basis functions, is {{used in conjunction with}} a gradient based optimiser to solve first the open-loop control and then the co-design problems. Numerical results show the impact of the time-frequency resolution of the parametrisation on the outcome of the optimisation. Overall, B-splines can achieve higher performance as they better exploit the flexible, high <b>frequency</b> <b>driven,</b> behaviour of the structure, particularly as large deformations lead to changes in the natural frequencies of the system. The discrete sines based parametrisation, on the other hand, is found to be a more robust choice. The mutual influence between control and structural dynamics during the design process is showed and used to explain the ability of the optimiser to approach a global optimum. In particular, it was found that control and structural disciplines can freeze the design around specific characteristic frequencies (locking), limiting the advantages of a co-design approach based on gradient methods...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore a}} new regime of hot carrier dynamics, in which {{electrons}} in a superlattice miniband exhibit a unique type of stochastic motion when {{a magnetic field}} is tilted at an angle θ to the superlattice axis. Remarkably, the dynamics of a miniband electron in a tilted magnetic field reduce to a one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator, of angular frequency ωC cos θ, where ωC is the cyclotron <b>frequency,</b> <b>driven</b> by a time-dependent plane wave whose angular frequency equals the Bloch frequency ωB. At bias voltages for which ωB = nωC cos θ, where n is an integer, the electron orbits change from localised Bloch-like trajectories to unbounded stochastic orbits, which diffuse rapidly through intricate web patterns in phase space. To quantify how these webs affect electron transport, we make drift-diffusion calculations of the current–voltage curves including the effects of space-charge build up. When the magnetic field is tilted, our simulations reveal a large resonant peak, which originates from stochastic delocalisation of the electron orbits. We show that the corresponding quantised eigenstates change discontinuously from a highly localised character when the system is off resonance to a fully delocalised form when the resonance condition is satisfied.
