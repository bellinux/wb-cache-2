5|$|Although {{they are}} native to North America and eastern Asia, they <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> well to {{countries}} {{in which they have}} been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand. Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced.|$|E
5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|Capybaras <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They can {{be found}} in many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong is also {{famous for}} their rich {{practice}} of cactus cultivation. Its nurseries attract people from far and wide for the absolutely stunning collection of cacti they cultivate. The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to fill many open {{ecological}} niches since {{making their}} way to Madagascar. Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> {{to life in}} a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} groups of mammals, rodents {{can be found on}} every continent except Antarctica. They are the only terrestrial placental mammals to have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention. Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands (e.g., the Polynesian rat). Rodents <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to almost every terrestrial habitat, from cold tundra (where they can live under snow) to hot deserts.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky {{commented on}} the Manning team's study, stating that small, {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) were {{likely to have been}} tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, gigantic dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when they were too large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.|$|E
5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, somewhere around 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, {{it has yet to}} be studied with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The Pangaré Brumbies {{appear to}} <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> well to their coastal environment, {{where they are}} {{consuming}} saltbush, which they {{do not appear to}} be damaging. The Department of Environment and Conservation and the Outback Heritage Horse Association of Western Australia (OHHAWA) are monitoring these particular Brumbies to ensure the careful management of these unusual feral horses.|$|E

5|$|The genus, though, is very {{variable}} {{in terms of}} habitat. Individual sundew species <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> {{to a wide variety}} of environments, including atypical habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (D. burmannii and D. indica), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately frost-resistant.|$|E
5|$|The island's {{vegetation}} consists exclusively of {{mosses and lichens}} which <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to {{the extreme}} Antarctic climate. The island has a very harsh climate with strong winds and freezing temperatures. The steady snowfall keeps vegetation to a minimum. The island is {{a breeding ground for}} a few seabirds, particularly southern fulmars, but also Wilson's storm petrels and Antarctic terns. Penguins, including Adélie and chinstrap penguins, visit the island infrequently. There are numerous seals, particularly crabeater seals, leopard seals and smaller numbers of southern elephant seals.|$|E
5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Males within Palaeognathae (with the {{exception}} of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with {{the exception}} of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds <b>have</b> <b>adapted</b> to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.|$|E
5000|$|Released {{from the}} egg is the miracidium. This infects the first {{intermediate}} host {{in one of}} two ways, either active or passive transmission. a) Active transmission <b>has</b> <b>adapted</b> for dispersal in space as a free swimming ciliated miricidium with adaptations for recognising and penetrating the first intermediate host. b) Passive transmission <b>has</b> <b>adapted</b> for dispersal in time and infects the first intermediate host contained within the egg.|$|R
