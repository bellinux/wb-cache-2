60|$|For a {{long time}} <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> with the letter in his hand. Then he arose, ordered his horse, and galloped away.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew it was}} Dan who {{had made}} this remark; but could not see him without {{changing}} his position, therefore <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b>|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not speak}} a word. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> for a long moment, his eyes pale and steady, his right hand like a claw.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> {{watching}} her retreating figure. An extraordinary {{sense of loss}} came into his mind, a vague impulse to pursue her and pour out vague passionate protestations....|$|R
60|$|Gys {{leaned down}} and put his ear {{to the heart of}} the patient. For two minutes <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b> Then <b>he</b> {{straightened}} up and a smile spread over his disfigured features.|$|R
60|$|Maraton {{was alone}} in the room. For some moments <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b> <b>He</b> heard Aaron and Julia in the hall but he did not hasten to join them. He moved instead to the window and stood {{watching}} Beldeman's retreating form.|$|R
6000|$|They {{looked and}} {{presently}} saw the tall {{figure of the}} hunter emerge from the bushes. He stopped and leaned on his rifle. For a minute <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b> Then <b>he</b> waved his hand and plunged into the thicket. Betty sighed and Alfred said: ...|$|R
60|$|His {{manner of}} playing was rather startling. So long as I kept {{my eyes on}} him <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> but the instant my {{attention}} wandered, or when in speaking I looked at my companion, the sudden violent dash at my head would be made.|$|R
60|$|His {{first thought}} was that Skip's friends had come {{together}} for the purpose of taking revenge upon the boy who had chastised the bully, and <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> an instant, wondering whether it would not be the better part of valour to seek safety in flight.|$|R
6000|$|With full over-tenderness {{she took}} his face between her hands, and kissed his eyes. The eyes opened, <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> looking at her. Her heart stood still. To hide her face from his dreadful opened eyes, in the darkness, she bent down and kissed him, whispering: ...|$|R
60|$|The Indian was now {{several hundred}} yards down the swift river, {{and for an instant}} had ceased paddling. The sun shone brightly on his eagle plumes. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> for a moment, and even at such a {{distance}} the dark, changeless face could be discerned. He lifted his hand and shook it menacingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> {{listening}} to the rattle of blocks and the creaking of trusses as the head-yards were hauled round. Sail was made on the ship and the windlass manned again while he stood still, lost in thought. He only roused himself when a barefooted seacannie glided past him silently {{on his way to}} the wheel.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} he fell down flat again, as {{suddenly}} {{as if he had}} been shot. Thus <b>he</b> <b>remained,</b> <b>motionless</b> and bereft of speech, until she had finished her meal, put everything in its place, and swept the hearth; when he motioned her to bring a chair to the bedside, and, being propped up again, opened a farther conversation.|$|R
60|$|Returning to the body, {{he lifted}} {{it to his}} shoulder, and risking all on a quick sally, ran swiftly across the narrow opening which {{separated}} the prisoner's tent {{from that of the}} dead man. Behind the silken wall he halted and lowered his burden to the ground, and there <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> for several minutes, listening.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he said--"I know. My dear friend, I know!" [...] And for a {{full minute}} <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> a little turned from Gregory. [...] "It will be better," [...] he said suddenly, [...] "for her {{to get rid of}} him. I'll go and see her myself. We'll spare her all we can. I'll go this afternoon, and let you know the result." ...|$|R
60|$|Beyond them a short {{distance}} was a second Britisher, tied tightly with {{what appeared to be}} strips torn from his own clothing, and midway between them and Darius, was a third body, evidently that of the man who had attacked me; but <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> and, having heard the blow which struck him down, I could well understand why he did not give any very violent signs of life.|$|R
60|$|Jean himself writhed {{under the}} lash of her scorn. Gaston Isbel turned a dead white. He could not answer her. He seemed {{stricken}} with merciless truth. Slowly dropping his head, <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> a pathetic and tragic figure; {{and he did}} not stir until the rapid beat of hoofs denoted the approach of horsemen. Blaisdell appeared on his white charger, leading a pack animal. And behind rode a group of men, all heavily armed, and likewise with packs.|$|R
60|$|He sat {{suspended}} {{in a fine}} recoil of disappointment, that seemed gradually to be destroying his understanding. But the unconscious state of patience persisted in him. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> without thought or knowledge, for a long time. Then he rose, and went downstairs, to play at chess {{with one of the}} students. His face was open and clear, with a certain innocent LAISSER-ALLER that troubled Gudrun most, made her almost afraid of him, whilst she disliked him deeply for it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remained</b> thus, <b>motionless,</b> without moving. We slipped {{gently to}} {{our hands and}} knees and crawled quietly to the door, and so down the stairs, our {{notebook}} in our teeth.|$|R
6000|$|The sleepy bar-keeper {{was that}} morning doomed to disappointment; for {{scarcely}} had the coach passed, when steps were heard upon the veranda, and a weary, dusty traveller threw his blanket and knapsack to the porter, and then {{dropped into a}} vacant arm-chair, with {{his eyes fixed on}} the distant crest of Table Mountain. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> for some time, until the bar-keeper, who had already concocted the conventional welcome of the Mansion House, appeared with it in a glass, put it upon the table, glanced at the stranger, and then, thoroughly awake, cried out,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{handkerchief}} was too small. It {{was soon}} wet through. She groped {{in his pocket}} for his own. Then, with its more ample capacity, she carefully dried his face. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> all the while. Then she drew his cheek to hers and kissed him. His face was cold. Her heart was hurt. She saw the tears welling quickly to his eyes again. As {{if he were a}} child, she again wiped away his tears. By now she herself was on the point of weeping. Her underlip was caught between her teeth.|$|R
60|$|Norgate dozed fitfully as {{the train}} sped on through the darkness. He woke once to find Herr Selingman in close {{confabulation}} with his agent {{on the opposite side}} of the compartment. They had a notebook before them and several papers spread out upon the seat. Norgate, who was really weary, closed his eyes again, and it seemed to him that he dreamed for a few moments. Then suddenly he found himself wide-awake. Although <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> the words which Selingman had spoken to his companion were throbbing in his ears.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>remained</b> as <b>motionless</b> as {{a statue}} while Tom passed within a dozen feet of him. Then When Tom {{went out on}} the road again Baxter ran forth, too, but in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
60|$|The music, which Sir Allan {{had been}} {{continuing}} {{with his right}} hand, came to a sudden end, and for {{the space of a}} few seconds <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> perfectly <b>motionless.</b> Then <b>he</b> rose and bowed slightly.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt the}} hot tears wet {{his neck and}} the hollows of his neck, and <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> {{suspended}} through one of man's eternities. Only now it had become indispensable to him to have her face pressed close to him; he could never let her go again. He could never let her head go away from the close clutch of his arm. <b>He</b> wanted to <b>remain</b> like that for ever, with his heart hurting him in a pain that was also life to him. Without knowing, he was looking down on her damp, soft brown hair.|$|R
5000|$|According to Plutarch, Vercingetorix {{surrendered}} in {{a dramatic}} fashion, riding his beautifully adorned horse out of Alesia and around Caesar's camp before dismounting in front of Caesar, stripping himself of his armor and sitting down at his opponent's feet, where <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> until <b>he</b> was taken away. [...] Caesar provides a first-hand contradiction of this account, describing Vercingetorix's surrender much more modestly. He was imprisoned in the Tullianum in Rome for five years, before being publicly displayed in Caesar's triumph in 46 BC. He was executed after the triumph, probably by strangulation in his prison, as ancient custom would have it.|$|R
60|$|He stopped. The {{first stroke}} of the Angelus rang {{from the little}} tower. The first stroke of that bell before whose magic {{exorcism}} all human passions fled, the peaceful bell that had for fifty years lulled the little fold of San Carmel to prayer and rest, came to his throbbing ear. His trembling hands groped for the crucifix, carried it to his left breast; his lips moved in prayer. His eyes were turned to the cold, passionless sky, where a few faint, far-spaced stars had silently stolen to their places. The Angelus still rang, his trembling ceased, <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> and rigid.|$|R
60|$|Wade {{was left}} {{sitting in the}} middle of the room on his roll of bedding, and for a long time <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> there <b>motionless,</b> with his head bent, his worn hands idly clasped. A heavy {{footfall}} outside aroused him from his meditation.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, {{as soon as}} {{the door}} had closed upon Falkner, Lee's smile vanished. With his colorless face turned to the fading light at the window, the hollows in his temples and the lines in the corners of his eyes seemed to have grown more profound. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> and absorbed in thought so deep that the light rustle of a skirt, that would at other times have thrilled his {{sensitive}} ear, passed unheeded. At last, throwing off his reverie with the full and unrestrained sigh of a man who believes himself alone, he was startled by the soft laugh of Mrs. Hale, who had entered the room unperceived.|$|R
60|$|In utter despair <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> {{silent and}} <b>motionless</b> until slumber {{came to his}} relief, and <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> wrapped in blissful {{unconsciousness}} for several hours.|$|R
25|$|Count Nostitz {{immediately}} {{sprang from}} his saddle, and holding {{with his left}} hand the bridle of his own horse, which had been slightly wounded, he drew his sword, firmly resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defence of his commander. Scarcely had he done so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b> Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|R
60|$|In {{his boat}} {{he had a}} hideous looking sucking fish, around the tail of which was tied a long cord with a wooden float at one end. While the boys were {{watching}} him he dropped the monster overboard, and in an instant it darted at a medium-sized Jew fish, attaching itself to the latter {{by means of the}} sucking valve on the top of its head. Having done this <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> his victim seeming to be literally paralyzed, and there was nothing for the boatman to do but pull in on the float, disengage his animated fishhook by a dextrous pressure on the sucker after both had been drawn aboard, and send the repulsive looking servant out again.|$|R
60|$|Cheenbuk {{heard the}} voice. He {{disposed}} of poor Alizay by hurling him {{away as if}} he had been a child, and was in the act of facing round when Magadar threw his arms round his body and held him. To be seized thus from behind is to most men a serious difficulty, but our Eskimo made short work of his assailant. He bent forward with his head to the ground so violently that the Indian was flung completely over him, and fell flat on his back, in which position <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless.</b> But it was impossible for Cheenbuk to cope with the other four Indians, who flung themselves on him simultaneously, and seized him by arms, legs, and throat.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> still <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> seething with inchoate rage, {{when his}} whole nature seemed to disintegrate. He seemed {{to live with}} a strain upon himself, and {{occasionally}} came these dark, chaotic rages, the lust for destruction. She then fought with him, and their fights were horrible, murderous. And then the passion between them came just as black and awful.|$|R
60|$|While {{the elders}} of the party were thus engaged in {{conclave}} {{at the door of}} their leader's tent, and while the rest were busy round their several fires, a man with a body much blacker than the night was secretly gliding about the camp like a huge snake, now crouching as he passed quickly, but without noise, in rear of the thick bushes; now creeping on hands and knees among the waggons and oxen, and anon gliding almost flat on his breast up to the very verge of the light thrown by the camp-fires. At one and another of the fires <b>he</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless</b> like the blackened trunk of a dead tree, with his glittering eyes fixed on the settlers, as if listening intently to their conversation.|$|R
6000|$|And with an assuring nod he {{released}} {{the fence and}} trotted off. He returned cautiously {{in the direction of}} the cave; he was by no means sure that the robbers might not return that day, and his mysterious rendezvous with Meely veiled a certain prudence. And it was well! For as he stealthily crept around the face of the outcrop, hidden in the ferns, he saw from the altered angle of the tree that the cavern was opened. <b>He</b> <b>remained</b> <b>motionless,</b> with bated breath. Then he heard the sound of subdued voices from the cavern, and a figure emerged from the opening. Johnny grasped the ferns rigidly to check the dreadful cry that rose to his lips at its sight. For that figure was his own brother! ...|$|R
