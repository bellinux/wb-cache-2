5|$|The Swinton {{house was}} {{constructed}} on Stage 16, while Stage 20 {{was used for}} Rouge City and other sets. Spielberg copied Kubrick's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew, banning press from the set, and making actors sign confidentiality agreements. Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production. <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> <b>Osment</b> and Jude Law applied prosthetic makeup daily {{in an attempt to}} look shinier and robotic. Costume designer Bob Ringwood (Batman, Troy) studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras. Spielberg found post-production on A.I. difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot Minority Report.|$|E

Throughout the series, Sora has been voiced by <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> <b>Osment</b> in the English version and Miyu Irino in the Japanese version. For his depiction as a child in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Sora was voiced by Luke Manriquez and Takuto Yoshinaga in English and Japanese, respectively.

5000|$|Richard Yates, like Lin's {{previous}} work, met polarized criticism. Many reviewers criticized Lin's idiosyncratic {{plain and}} minimally descriptive style.

[...] Others were more forgiving; Charles Bock's mostly negative review for The New York Times allowed that Lin could be [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and that [...] "when <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> and Dakota find solace in each other through small, intimate gestures, or in descriptions of Dakota’s defeated parents, Lin’s flat style resonates." [...] The Boston Globe's review described Lin's writing as having [...] "the effect of putting a red butterfly behind glass: detached but brighter." ...|$|R

500|$|Kingdom Hearts was {{announced}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2001. Initial details were {{that it would be}} a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Nomura and included Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. A playable demo was available at the Tokyo Game Show in 2001.

500|$|Kenneth {{revealing}} that {{his real name}} is [...] "Dick Whitman" [...] is {{a reference to the}} main character Don Draper of Mad Men (played by Jon Hamm, who had a recurring role on 30 Rock earlier in the season). [...] "Earn this", spoken by Kenneth as Jenna has poisoned him again, references the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan when actor Tom Hanks says the same words to actor Matt Damon's title character. When she is told that Kenneth has gone into a severe allergic shock and needs to have his hands cut off, Jenna apologizes to him for what she has done, telling him [...] "I'm just a girl sitting in front of a boy she poisoned so this other guy would go to town on her", which Jenna misquotes from actress Julia Roberts' character from the romantic comedy Notting Hill (1999). After Kenneth drinks his strawberry water, as he risked his life so that Jenna can meet the paramedic again, Jenna says to Kenneth [...] "You magnificent sonofabitch!", a line quoted by actor George C. Scott in the American biographical war film Patton (1970). Kenneth blows white smoke out while referencing bringing back something from [...] "the other side" [...] (death) echoes the same look when actor <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> <b>Osment</b> remarked [...] "I see dead people" [...] in the movie The Sixth Sense (1999).|$|E
500|$|... "Dead Celebrities" [...] makes {{frequent}} {{mention of}} the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense, which stars <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> <b>Osment</b> {{as a young boy}} who can see ghosts. Ike's line, [...] "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, [...] "I see dead people." [...] The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, Poltergeist. Another film reference is made to The Exorcist when the medium is flung from the window. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also mocks the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to be frightened and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.|$|E

[...] A 1UP.com writer called Sora [...] "one of my all-time favorite Square characters", praising his cheerful personality. Gamasutra commented on Sora's journey along the series in their feature [...] "The Birth of Collecting: The Osiris Archetype In Games" [...] by Jason Johnson; while comparing Sora with Isis, Johnson found Sora's adventure appealing. IGN praised Sora's resilient character, noting how such an ordinary [...] "youngster" [...] could face up to his challenges during his adventures for the sake of friendship, while RPGFan's Nicole Monet Kirk labelled him as an [...] "extremely likable hero". Furthermore, in the book [...] "Interactive Storytelling for Video Games: A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories", it is noted that while Sora follows a [...] "standard hero archetype", his character becomes more believable and strong when worrying about his friends' fates. <b>Haley</b> <b>Joel</b> <b>Osment,</b> Sora's English voice actor, has also been praised by Gaming Target's Matt Swidder, who mentioned Osment [...] "makes a perfect fit for Sora". While remarking on Osment's work, Louis Bedigian from GameZone mentioned that [...] "Sora had something rarely found in video-game characters: depth" [...] also praising his role in Kingdom Hearts.
