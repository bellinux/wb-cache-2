25|$|On December 6, 2016, a Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III cargo plane, {{operating}} as Key Lime Air flight LYM308, crashed north of Pelham, Georgia, USA, {{on a flight}} from Panama City, Florida to Albany, Georgia. The pilot, the sole occupant, was killed. Weather in the area was poor, with a thunderstorm {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>destination</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the <b>destination</b> <b>airport,</b> the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of pre-packed meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container. This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's cabin staff, it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by cabin staff during the aircraft's turnaround at the <b>destination</b> <b>airport</b> (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{subsequent}} NTSB investigation focused {{on the fact that}} the instrument approach at the <b>destination</b> <b>airport</b> was not legal for night landing, and the overall pressure applied on the charter company and flight crew by the charter customer to complete the flight into the original destination. According to witnesses, the charter customer, upon learning that the flight might have to be diverted to an alternate airport due to the night landing restriction, had his business assistant call Avjet management, to [...] "let them know that the airplane was not going to be redirected".|$|E
50|$|As Modern Air's West Berlin charter permit did not {{authorise}} {{the carriage}} of cargo, the airline's Berlin management decided to utilise the only lightly filled cargo holds of its Tegel-based CV-990s to carry inbound catering and essential spares and tooling, including a spare tyre. The reason for carrying catering destined for passengers booked on return flights {{all the way}} from Berlin rather than appointing local suppliers at <b>destination</b> <b>airports</b> was that it worked out cheaper and was deemed more reliable and safer (compared with relying on overseas suppliers with varying quality and hygiene standards and who often plied their trade only seasonally) while the reason for carrying essential spares and tooling on outbound aircraft was to ensure emergency serviceability at <b>destination</b> <b>airports</b> lacking CV-990 spares inventories, given the type's narrow operator base (compared with the then ubiquitous Boeing and Douglas types and other popular contemporary aircraft types).|$|R

2500|$|Pilot Hughes later {{made contact}} with Dyersburg Regional Airport in Dyersburg, Tennessee, and landed there at 5:05pm, where he {{requested}} a weather briefing {{for the remainder of}} the flight to Nashville. He was informed by Federal Aviation Administration employee Leroy Neal that local conditions were marginal for VFR flight and weather at the <b>destination</b> <b>airport</b> was below VFR minimums. Hughes then asked if the Dyersburg airport runways were lighted at night in case he had to return and Neal replied that they were. The pilot then informed Neal he would fly east towards the Tennessee River and navigate to Nashville from there, as he was familiar with the terrain in that area. Hughes expressed concern with a [...] high television transmitting tower north of Nashville, then stated that he would attempt the flight and return if the weather conditions worsened.|$|E
2500|$|Calgary has an {{extensive}} street network. Smaller roads are supplemented {{with a number}} of major arteries, expressways and freeways. The largest of these is the north-south running Deerfoot Trail. The majority of main expressways and freeways are named Trails, {{as well as some of}} the main arterial roads that do not fit in the numbering grid. The use of the term Trails to describe major highways resulted from the development of early pioneer trails into the highways themselves. The original trails were named after the settlements to which they lead; for example, Edmonton Trail (part of the former Calgary and Edmonton Trail), (Fort) Macleod Trail, and Banff Trail (which combined with 24th Street W was later renamed Crowchild Trail). More recently developed local expressways were given the Trail moniker and have been named after important people from Calgary's history (Crowchild Trail, Marquis of Lorne Trail), native groups (Stoney Trail, Sarcee Trail, Blackfoot Trail) or again after their <b>destination</b> (<b>Airport</b> Trail). There are a couple of exceptions to this rule in which a few older residential streets have also been labeled [...] "Trail", such as Morley Trail.|$|E
