500|$|The 18 {{operating}} {{nuclear power}} plants in Canada generated about 16% of its electricity in 2006. A national Nuclear <b>Fuel</b> <b>Waste</b> Act was enacted by the Canadian Parliament in 2002, requiring nuclear energy corporations to create a waste management organization to propose to the Government of Canada approaches for management of nuclear waste, and implementation of an approach subsequently selected by the government. The Act defined management as [...] "long term management by means of storage or disposal, including handling, treatment, conditioning or transport {{for the purpose of}} storage or disposal." ...|$|E

2500|$|The concept {{outlined}} {{in the book is}} not simply one of urban planning, but also included a system of community management. For example, the Garden City project would be financed through a system that Howard called [...] "Rate-Rent", which combined financing for community services (rates) with a return for those who had invested {{in the development of the}} City (rent). The book also advocated a rudimentary form of competitive tendering, whereby the municipality would purchase services, such as water, <b>fuel,</b> <b>waste</b> disposal, etc., from (often local) commercial providers. These systems were never fully implemented, in Letchworth, Welwyn or their numerous imitators.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses {{numerous}} threats {{to people and}} the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will ever be a sustainable energy source. These threats include health risks, accidents and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport. [...] Along with the fears associated with nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear power opponents fear sabotage by terrorists of nuclear plants, diversion and misuse of radioactive fuels or <b>fuel</b> <b>waste,</b> as well as naturally-occurring leakage from the unsolved and imperfect long-term storage process of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They further argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
5000|$|In April, 2001, {{the federal}} {{government}} introduced an Act respecting the long-term management of nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>waste.</b> Also known as the Nuclear <b>Fuel</b> <b>Waste</b> Act, this legislation came into effect on November 15, 2002. However, this legislation dealt only with the long-term management of used nuclear fuel (high-level waste), not L&ILW.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, the California Energy Commission {{announced}} that it would not approve any more nuclear plants unless the utilities could specify <b>fuel</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal costs, an impossible task without decision on reprocessing, spent <b>fuel</b> storage and <b>waste</b> disposal. By the late 1970s, over thirty states had passed legislation regulating various activities associated with nuclear waste.|$|R

5000|$|Radioactive {{waste in}} Canada can be grouped into three broad categories: nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>waste,</b> {{low-level}} radioactive waste, and uranium mill tailings.

50|$|Compared to {{the solid}} waste {{disposal}} problems of coal and nuclear <b>fuels,</b> woodchip <b>fuel's</b> <b>waste</b> disposal problems are less grave; in a study from 2001 fly ash from wood chip combustion had 28.6 mg cadmium/kg dry matter. Compared to fly ash from burning of straw, cadmium was bound more heavily, with only small amounts of cadmium leached. It was speciated {{as a form of}} cadmium oxide, cadmium silicate (CdSiO3); authors noted that adding it to agricultural or forest soils in the long-term could cause a problem with accumulation of cadmium.|$|R
50|$|Current {{climate change}} is due to {{anthropogenic}} GHG concentrations. Human activities including burning fossil <b>fuels,</b> <b>waste,</b> and wood products cause CO2 emissions. CO2 {{is the most common}} type of GHG. Methane is emitted during coal, natural gas, or oil production. Other sources include agricultural livestock and decaying organic matter. Nitrous oxide is emitted through industrial and agricultural activities. Many industrial companies have switched from burning coal and petroleum fuel to natural gas. More toxic pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, are emitted in smaller rates and are known as High Global Warming Potential Gases.|$|R

The World Nuclear Association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production.
