5|$|Women {{are active}} and play key roles in {{organizing}} activities and administering {{them in the}} Church. Female office holders are always head of <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and not groups of men. A deaconess can help pastors and deacons, but cannot herself administer the sacrament. All members of the ministerial hierarchy are paid for their services {{as part of the}} tithe by the congregational members.|$|E
5|$|Women {{make up only}} a {{third of}} the {{membership}} in the Raëlian Church, though two anecdotes in the Raëlian Contact newsletter report female majorities joining the movement's Asian Mongolian chapter. Women such as Brigitte Boisselier, the Chief Executive Officer of Clonaid, play a powerful role in the Raëlian Church. There are two major <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in the Raëlian Church.|$|E
5|$|Ship's {{regulations}} {{were designed to}} keep third class passengers confined to their area of the ship. The Titanic was fitted with grilles to prevent the classes from mingling and these gates were normally kept closed, although the stewards could open them {{in the event of}} an emergency. In the rush following the collision, the stewards, occupied with waking up sleeping passengers and leading <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children to the boat deck, did not have time to open all the gates, leaving many of the confused third class passengers stuck below decks.|$|E

5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and children from the villages of Bani Zeid would visit the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{the couple}} {{purchased}} a house together located on Burlington Crescent in Toronto, near Edith's clinic and lived there until their retirement. In 1965, both women retired and sold their Toronto home, {{moving to the}} farm house owned by the Fraser family in Burlington, Ontario. The farm was located in a very scenic setting on the Niagara Escarpment, near the Bruce Trail. Fraser, who enjoyed gardening, tended the ground and Williams, who was a fine cook, enjoyed cooking for their frequent guests. Having become interested in mountaineering, Williams enjoyed mountain-climbing and both women enjoyed taking excursions which allowed them to be outdoors. In their archives are many photographs taken with <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> on camping and canoe trips. Williams suffered a severe stroke {{near the end of}} 1976 and never fully recovered from it requiring repeated hospitalizations at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Fraser drove in daily from Burlington to visit Williams. She died in 1979, after a series of additional strokes and Fraser returned to the home in Burlington where she remained until three weeks before her death, when her family placed her in a nursing home.|$|E

25|$|There {{are local}} festivals of which Ortigueira's Festival del Mundo Celta is {{especially}} important.

25|$|The {{proportion}} of females {{as a predictor}} of c was largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobel z = 1.93, P= 0.03) which is in vein with previous research showing that women score higher on social sensitivity tests. While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the high social sensitivity of group members.|$|E

25|$|Artist Geraldine Robarts of the United Kingdom {{fled the}} Blitz to South Africa {{where she grew}} to {{adulthood}} and became a Bahá'í. Robarts and family fled Apartheid to Uganda where she was a lecturer in the Makerere University but then fled Idi Amin, and then came to Kenya in 1972. She taught and {{was head of the}} department of Painting at Kenyatta University. Starting as early as Uganda she worked with groups of artists to have their art appear in museums and developed a project for <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> to show case their art as well as provide a mechanism for rural development work.|$|E
25|$|In Pintupi narratives, {{the male}} Tingari groups are usually {{followed}} by <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> {{who may be}} accompanied by children. The more public women's stories usually revolve around the gathering and preparation of bush foods (Perkins & Fink 2000:281-290). However, other narratives relate {{to a group of}} powerful ancestor women – the Kanaputa (Ganabuda) or Mungamunga (Berndt 1972:208; Poirier 2005:130) – who often travelled in a Tingari ritual group (Myers 1976:188). These Tingari women were sometimes accompanied by young girls, whom they provided with ritual education (Berndt 1970:225), and were often followed by (or following) groups of Tingari men. Many of the Kukatja stories collected at Balgo relate to the Kanaputa (Berndt 1970:222; Poirier 2005:77-79).|$|E
25|$|After the {{massacre}} in the church, Ahmet Aga summoned all the surviving villagers outside, {{saying that it}} would be {{in order to make a}} list of the slain and the widows. The better part of the survivors gathered, since those who did not obey would be killed. They were divided in two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and men; then the Ottoman commander made the women stand back and slew all the remaining 300 men. Those women who protested were also raped and killed. On the same day there were another 300 people murdered on the wooden bridge beside the school, first their arms were cut off, then their ears, noses, shoulders, and only after that they were finished.|$|E

25|$|Takembeng or Takumbeng are {{a female}} social {{movement}} in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. These movements connect with traditional practices common throughout the Western grassfields of Cameroon where <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> perform ostracizing rituals against individuals in their communities. Toward the end of colonial control {{and in the early}} years of independent Cameroon (the 1950s and 1960s), these local practices became a crucial tool for larger political protest, often against agricultural policy. With political liberalization in the 1990s, the Takembeng women became a crucial part of opposition to the ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party. The women marched with the Social Democratic Front (SDF) and would use nudity and the social status of older women to prevent troops and security forces from harassing protesters.|$|E
25|$|Anlu is a {{traditional}} practice in the Kom communities of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. The practice revolves around <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> gathering together and engaging in extreme behavior to shame and ostracize individuals who break community morals, such as physical abuse of a pregnant woman or incest. The origin of the practice is said {{to come from a}} time the women of Kom communities were the only people left to defend the towns from an invading force and so dressed as men and caused the opposition army to flee. The traditional practice became relevant with large-scale, political mobilizations by women from 1958 until 1961. This political anlu paralyzed both traditional and colonial administration in the Kom region and disrupted courts, schools, markets, and travel through the region.|$|E
25|$|Traditional anlu, {{similar to}} fombuen or keluh in Kedjom Keku {{communities}} and ndofoumbgui in the Aghem tribe, involves <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> organizing and shaming individuals who violate certain moral rules. The ostracizing could develop {{as a result}} of any set of offenses that violated community morality and were believed to threaten the life of the community (by damaging fertility, food, or prosperity). These offenses could include insulting one's mother, physically abusing a pregnant or nursing woman, committing incest, or other offenses. The women would respond with actions considered outside of the communities moral order (vulgar speech, display of genitals, dress in men's clothing, defecation on the offender's property, etc.) in order to highlight the egregiousness of the offense and pressure for repayment. The women themselves are organized under the leadership of the oldest woman of the community, named the na-anlu.|$|E
