This device is a linear drive with small (. 0004 in.) and highly repeatable step increments. Extremely close tolerances are also held in tilt and decentering. The unique mechanization is described with attention to the design details that contribute to positional accuracy.

50|$|On {{encoders}} with <b>detents</b> {{there are}} different ways to switch states. In some, both A and B are always open circuit at the <b>detents,</b> and an entire 00 → 00 switching cycle occurs while transitioning from one <b>detent</b> to the next. Others have <b>detents</b> of alternating 00 and 11 value, with staggered switching times during the transition between <b>detents.</b>|$|R
50|$|A ball <b>detent</b> type limiter transmits {{force through}} {{hardened}} balls which rest in <b>detents</b> {{on the shaft}} and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their <b>detents,</b> thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple <b>detent</b> positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.|$|R

Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work.

50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type <b>detent</b> on the shift sleeve and <b>detents</b> on the shift rail assists the driver in shifting quicker. The <b>detent</b> raises the force required to move the shift lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between the shift sleeve and the shift rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|R

50|$|The <b>detent</b> or {{chronometer}} escapement {{is considered}} the most accurate of the balance wheel escapements, and was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th century also used it. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted <b>detent</b> type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of <b>detent</b> escapement was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the <b>detent</b> pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783, however as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a spring <b>detent</b> escapement but, with improved design, Earnshaw's version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications {{during the last decade}} of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|Haptic technology, {{providing}} force cues {{and creating}} a pro-grammable physical instrument interface, can assist musi-cians in making gestures. The finite reaction time of the human motor control system implies that the execution of a brief musical gesture does not rely on immediate feedback from the senses, rather it is preprogrammed to some degree. Consequently, we suggest designing relatively simple and deterministic interfaces for providing haptic assistance. In this paper, we consider the specific problem of assist-ing a musician in selecting pitches from a continuous range. We build on a prior study by O’Modhrain of the accuracy of pitches selected by musicians on a Theremin-like haptic interface. To improve the assistance, we augment the inter-face with programmed <b>detents</b> so that the musician can feel the locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, the musician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such as glissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various forms of haptic <b>detents,</b> including fixed <b>detent</b> levels and force-sensitive <b>detent</b> levels. Preliminary results from a subject test confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection brought about by <b>detents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{have increased in}} the last four decades in high technology applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties and low weight. In the automotive industry carbon fiber have become popular exclusively in luxury cars because of its high cost. However, Carbon-glass hybrid composites offer an effective alternative to designers to implement fiber-reinforced composites into several conventional applications without a considerable price increase maintaining most of their mechanical properties. A door latch system is a complex mechanism that is under high loading conditions during car accidents such as side impacts and rollovers. Therefore, the Department of Transportation in The United States developed a series of tests that every door latch system comply in order to be installed in a vehicle. The implementation of fiber-reinforced {{composite materials}} in a door latch system was studied by analyzing the material behavior during the FMVSS No. 206 transverse test using computational efforts and experimental testing. Firstly, a computational model of the current forkbolt and <b>detent</b> structure was developed. Several efforts were conducted in order to create an effective and time efficient model. Two simplified models were implemented with two different contact interaction approaches. 9 composite materials were studied in forkbolt and 5 in <b>detent</b> including woven carbon fiber, unidirectional carbon fiber, woven carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites and unidirectional carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites. The computational model results showed that woven fiber-reinforced composite materials were stiffer than the unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite materials. For instance, a forkbolt made of woven carbon fibers was 20 % stiffer than a forkbolt made of unidirectional fibers symmetrically stacked in 0 ° and 90 ° alternating directions. Furthermore, Hybrid composite materials behaved as expected in forkbolt noticing a decline in the load-displacement slopes while the percentage of glass fiber increased. In the other hand, results showed that a <b>detent</b> made of only glass fiber layers was preferable than a carbon-glass fiber hybrid <b>detent</b> due to the high stresses shown in carbon fiber layers. Ultimately, forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were redesigned according to their functionality and test results. It was observed that the new design was stiffer than the original by showing a steeper load-displacement curve. Subsequently, an experimental procedure was performed in order to correlate computational model results. Fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were waterjet cut from a composite laminate manufactured by Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VART) process. Then, samples were tested according to the computational model. Six testing sample combinations of forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were tested including the top three woven iterations forkbolts from the computational model paired with woven and unidirectional glass fiber <b>detents.</b> Test results showed a stiffness drop of 15 % when the carbon fiber percentage decreases from 100 % to 75 %. Also, it was observed that woven glass fiber <b>detent</b> was superior to the unidirectional glass fiber <b>detent</b> by presenting a forkbolt-detent stiffness 38 % higher. Moreover, the new design of forkbolt and <b>detent</b> were tested showing a stiffness increment of 29 %. Furthermore, it was observed that fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and <b>detent</b> did not reach the desired load of 5000 N. However, the redesigned forkbolt made of 100 % woven carbon fiber and the redesign <b>detent</b> made of 100 % woven glass fiber were close to reach that load. The design review based on test results performed (DRBTR) showed that components did not fail where the computational model concluded to be the areas with the highest maximum principal stress. In contrast to the computational model, all samples failed at the contact area between forkbolt and <b>detent.</b> ...|$|R

As the two escape wheels A and B rotate meshed together, {{one of them is}} locked when an impulse/locking tooth, standing upright from the escape wheel, rests on the wide straight locking stone of the <b>detent.</b> In the figure the balance is rotating counter-clockwise and just at the point that the unlocking pallet C on the balance is about to move the <b>detent</b> D to release peg E on escape wheel A which is resting on the jewelled locking surface underneath the <b>detent</b> arm. The impulse pallet F mounted on the balance staff just below the unlocking pallet C will have moved in front of peg G whilst the balance completes its unlocking arc. When the peg E is released by the <b>detent,</b> the escape wheels accelerate together and peg G will deliver an impulse on the jewelled rear face of impulse pallet F.

50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring <b>detent</b> and pivoted <b>detent.</b> In both of these, a small <b>detent</b> locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the <b>detent,</b> allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the <b>detent</b> allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the <b>detent.</b> The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A <b>detent</b> escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|R
50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball <b>detents</b> act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball <b>detents</b> and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball <b>detents</b> can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball <b>detents</b> (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball <b>detents.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} analyzing a five-phase fractional-slot permanent magnet tubular linear motor (FSPMTLM) with the modified winding function approach (MWFA). MWFA is a fast modeling method and it gives deep insight into the calculations of the following parameters: air-gap magnetic field, inductances, flux linkages, and <b>detent</b> force, which are essential in modeling the motor. First, using a magnetic circuit model, the air-gap magnetic density is computed from stator magnetomotive force (MMF), flux barrier, and mover geometry. Second, the inductances, flux linkages, and <b>detent</b> force are analytically calculated using modified winding function and the air-gap magnetic density. Finally, a model has been established with the five-phase Park transformation and simulated. The calculations of <b>detent</b> force reveal that the end-effect force is {{the main component of}} the <b>detent</b> force. This is also proven by finite element analysis on the motor. The accuracy of the model is validated by comparing with the results obtained using semianalytical method (SAM) and measurements to analyze the motor’s transient characteristics.
