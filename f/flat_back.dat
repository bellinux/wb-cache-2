5|$|When the teamsheets were released, Wenger's {{selection}} showed Rosický and Giroud {{would start}} the match as substitutes and competitive debuts {{were given to}} Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and Alexis Sánchez. Arsenal employed a 4–1–4–1 formation to start the game, with a defensive midfielder (Mikel Arteta) sitting between a <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> four and a four-man midfield; Yaya Sanogo led the Arsenal attack as a lone centre-forward.|$|E
25|$|He {{started his}} {{coaching}} career {{when he was}} 25. His first senior job came across {{when he took over}} 1st division outfield Shahab Zanjan. During his three years with the club, he implemented 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 systems with <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> four which was refreshing in Iran’s football dominated by traditional 3-5-2 formation. Zanjan club produced some fluid and contemporary football despite limited talent and finance.|$|E
25|$|In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, {{a series}} of {{variations}} of the bow fibula appeared in the southern Balkans, known variously as Greek, Macedonian, or Thracian bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square catch plate. Some of the large square catch plates were decorated with complex incised geometric or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open moulds.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the 4–4–2 {{formation}} rose {{to prominence}} in the 1960s. The English also developed a tactical formation {{that looked like a}} 4–4–2 (more accurately 4–1–3–2) but switched to 4–2–4 or 4–3–3 depending on how they attacked. The <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> four that had become so popular remained intact, but the midfield was a free-flowing unit with players given license to attack as the scenario saw fit. In defence, using the 1966 World Cup side as an example, Martin Peters, Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball would all stay back to counter the opposition attack. However, in attack they had two options: Peters and Ball could charge forward, creating problems for the opposition out wide with their pace and crossing ability, creating either a 4–2–4 formation or a 3–3–4 formation when one of the full-backs pushed forward; or Charlton could burst through the middle of the strike partnership of Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst and overload the centre of the opposition defence in a 4–3–3, providing either an extra man in the box or an effective long-shot alternative. The unsung hero of Alf Ramsey's England side was Nobby Stiles, who was the midfield linchpin, whom the team relied on in defence when Charlton surged forward in support of the strikers.|$|E
500|$|Monument23 is sculpted from {{andesite}} {{and falls}} {{in the middle of}} the size range for confirmed colossal heads. It stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a <b>flat</b> <b>back.</b> Lee Parsons contests John Graham's identification of Monument23 as a re-carved colossal head; he views the side ornaments, identified by Graham as ears, as rather the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards. Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the re-carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{continued}} to dominate proceedings {{in the second}} half; The Observer football correspondent Frank McGhee noted Arsenal's [...] "obvious need for a more adventurous approach." [...] The club's fans demanded Marwood's introduction to the match, and in the 58th minute the player came on for Caesar. This meant Arsenal's formation was tweaked to 4–4–2, with a <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> four defence. Arsenal {{found it hard to}} contain the Liverpool attack; Lukic saved an effort from Beardsley one-handed, but only could turn the ball out for a corner. A pass by Ronnie Whelan managed to split the Arsenal defence and find Nicol; Winterburn however {{put an end to the}} move with a tackle. David Burrows's attempt on goal was blocked by O'Leary later on and Lukic did enough to save Rush's shot with his legs.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two general}} types of {{gemstone}} cutting: cabochon and facet. Cabochons are smooth, often domed, with <b>flat</b> <b>backs.</b> Agates and turquoise are usually cut this way, but precious stones such as rubies, emeralds and sapphires also may be. Many stones like star sapphires and moonstones must be cut {{this way in}} order to see the effects the stones have in them.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>backs,</b> or books {{without a}} curved spines, should ideally have no swell. Books with rounded backs, or curved spines, however, require swell. Too little swell results in {{insufficient}} backing, {{and the book}} will lack proper shoulders. Too much swell, however, causes the spine to become over-round, and can create a propensity among the middle sections of the book to collapse inwards, falling toward the fore edge.|$|R
500|$|Monument 23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period. It appears {{that it was an}} Olmec-style colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure sculpture. If this was {{originally}} a colossal head then it would be the only example known from outside the Olmec heartland. Monument23 is sculpted from andesite and falls {{in the middle of the}} size range for confirmed Olmec colossal heads. It stands [...] high and measures [...] wide by [...] deep. Like the examples from the Olmec heartland, the monument features a <b>flat</b> <b>back.</b> Lee Parsons contested John Graham's identification of Monument23 as a recarved colossal head; he viewed the side ornaments that Graham identified as ears as instead being the scrolled eyes of an open-jawed monster gazing upwards. Countering this, James Porter has claimed that the recarving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident. Monument23 was damaged in the mid-20th century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel chisel. As a result, the top is fragmented, although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{drawback}} of the Harrington Rod {{is that it}} straightens out {{the normal}} front to back curvature of the segment of the spine that is fused, which in many patients results in a <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> deformity, also known as [...] "flatback syndrome". [...] Advances in surgical techniques and technology in the late 1990s were eventually able, in most cases, to correct scoliosis without causing flatback syndrome, leading to the gradual phasing out of the Harrington Rod.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mountains}} are divided by marked valleys through the landscape; the deepest valley is filled by Rondvatnet, a narrow lake filling the steep {{space between the}} large Storronden-Rondeslottet massif and Smiubelgen ("The blacksmith's bellows"). The central massif is also cut by [...] "botns": flat, dead stone valleys below the steep mountain walls of the peaks. Generally, Rondane does not receive enough precipitation to generate persistent glaciers, but glacier-like heaps of snow {{can be found in}} the <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> valleys.|$|E

Although Dunis played the album's percussion, Coyes wrote the rhythms, and said [...] "I tried to write rhythms that would clash with each other but still work, so on this record I tried to go deeper into that idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Heath {{had lived}} in the Albany, off Piccadilly; at the {{unexpected}} end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> ("So much for European Unity!" [...] Heath later wrote in his memoirs). Heath took the flat of a Conservative MP Tim Kitson for four months; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his watch broke and Heath invited him to take one of a large collection which he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, the Duke of Westminster, a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, Belgravia for an annual rent of £1,250 (just under £10,000 at 2014 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath's housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from climbing the stairs.|$|E

60|$|Even {{if these}} facts were not already {{familiar}} to everyone there, her outward appearance would have attracted attention. Contrasted with the gorgeous red, black, and yellow skirts of the dancers, her plain, tightly fitting gown and hat, all of one delicate gray, were sufficiently notable in themselves, even {{had they not}} seemed, like the girl herself, a kind of quiet protest to the glaring flounces before her. Her small, straight waist and <b>flat</b> <b>back</b> brought into greater relief the corsetless, waistless, swaying figures of the Mexican girls, and her long, slim, well-booted feet, peeping from the stiff, white edges of her short skirt, made their broad, low-quartered slippers, held on by the big toe, appear more preposterous than ever. Suddenly she seemed {{to realize that she}} was standing there alone, but without fear or embarrassment. She drew back a little, glancing carelessly behind her as if missing some previous companion, and then her eyes fell upon mine. She smiled an easy recognition; then a moment later, her glance rested more curiously upon Enriquez, who was still by my side. I disengaged myself and instantly joined her, particularly as I noticed that a few of the other bystanders were beginning to stare at her with little reserve.|$|E
