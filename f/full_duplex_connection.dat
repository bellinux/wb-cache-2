40|$|Within the PCC Wireless IP project, {{we study}} how to {{optimize}} TCP/IP connections over fading wireless links. An important aspect {{here is to}} evaluate transport protocols for reliable (error-free) end-to end communication. The dominating transport protocol on the Internet is TCP/IP. This protocol has been tuned since 1977 for the primary problem in a global network, congestion and high but static latencies. The Internet is changing to utilize more wireless network segments. Wireless networks introduce new problems such as stochastic packet loss and varying latencies, which create problems for existing TCP flow control algorithms. In this paper, we describe and compare schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks and propose our own solution for the problem.

40|$|Network {{processors}} (NPs) are {{a solution}} to packet processing at the ever-increasing wire speeds of modern data communication networks. The traditional way of increasing the packetprocessing rate of a device is by migrating software into silicon. With NPs, the trend is the opposite: hardware functionality is being implemented in NP specific software to produce a device that offers high performance as well as avoiding the inherent lack of flexibility of any hardwire solution: an NP based device is easy to program and to re-program. This thesis project studies the possibility to replace a hardwired ATM forwarding engine device with a more flexible device based on the Intel IXP 2400 network processor running packet-processing software. The targeted network uses relatively slow-speed links, thus focus is more on flexibility and ease-of-use than on state-of-the-art performance.

Prior work primarily allows a <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> receiver to either send back a packet (bidirectional mode) or to forward another packet to its neighbor (secondary transmission). In our work, we look beyond a node pair and explore how a network can best utilize the <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> capability. When a <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> receiver {{does not have any}} packets to send back, concurrent transmissions (exposed transmissions) can be initiated. In a distributed channel access protocol, rapid signaling is crucial to identify the best mode for a given pair of transmitter and receiver, and to inform potential exposed terminals of transmission opportunities. In this paper, we present, RCTC, a fast and low overhead signaling mechanism based on Pseudo-random Noise (PN) sequences to enable multimodal operation of wireless links in a distributed channel access setting to support concurrent transmissions in the neighborhood. Our prototype with USRPs shows up to 78 % throughput gain. Extensive simulations over larger networks show a throughput gain of up to 131 % for RCTC over the native <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> scheme and up to 111 % over a scheme that enables secondary transmission.

For improving the performance a communication network, system deficiencies such as transmitter and receiver impairments need to be removed or compensated. One way to improve the network efficiency is to employ <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology. <b>Full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology doubles the network capacity compared to the case when typical frequency division duplexing (FDD) or time division duplexing (TDD) are employed in a transceiver design. Although <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> (FD) technology has enhanced the performance of the radio communication devices, the main challenge in <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> communication is the leaking self-interference signal from the transmitter to the receiver. Different methods are employed to suppress the self-interference signal in digital and analog domains which are categorized as passive or active cancellations. These techniques are discussed in this thesis in order to understand from which point in the propagation path, the required signal for cancellation can be taken and how those techniques are employed in digital and analog domains. For having a good self-interference cancellation (SIC) both analog and digital cancellation techniques are needed since typical digital suppression method is low complex and somewhat limited. In this thesis, first we start with discussing about the <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> technology and the reason why it has become popular in recent years and later <b>full</b> <b>duplex</b> deficiencies are examined.
