After dissolved PHC concentrations had stabilized at a low level, engineered in situ bioremediation was terminated. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of <b>intrinsic</b> in situ <b>bioremediation</b> as a follow-up measure to remove PHC remaining in the aquifer after terminating engineered in situ bioremediation. In the first 7 months of <b>intrinsic</b> in situ <b>bioremediation,</b> redox conditions in the source area became more reducing as indicated by lower concentrations of SO 2 4 &# 8254; and higher concentrations of Fe(II) and CH 4. In the core of the source area, strongly reducing conditions prevailed during the remaining study period (3 years) and dissolved PHC concentrations were higher than during engineered in situ bioremediation. This suggests that biodegradation in the core zone was limited by the availability of oxidants. In lateral zones of the source area, however, gradually more oxidized conditions were reestablished again, suggesting that PHC availability increasingly limited biodegradation. The total DIC production rate in the aquifer decreased within 2 years to about 25 % of that during engineered in situ bioremediation and remained at that level. Stable carbon isotope analysis confirmed that the produced DIC mainly originated from PHC mineralization. The total rate of DIC and CH 4 production in the source area was more than 300 times larger than the rate of PHC elution. This indicates that biodegradation coupled to consumption of naturally occurring oxidants was an important process for removal of PHC which remained in the aquifer after terminating engineered measures...|$|R

As such, they are prevalent within deep subsurface fossil fuel deposits and in shallow subsurface environments such as aquifers that are contaminated with hydrocarbons. These environments are typically anaerobic, and host diverse microbial communities that can potentially use alkanes as substrates. Anaerobic alkane biodegradation {{has been reported to}} occur under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Elucidating the pathways of anaerobic alkane metabolism has been of interest in order to understand how microbes can be used to remediate contaminated sites. Alkane activation primarily occurs by addition to fumarate, yielding alkylsuccinates, unique anaerobic metabolites {{that can be used to}} indicate in situ anaerobic alkane metabolism. These metabolites have been detected in hydrocarbon-contaminated shallow aquifers, offering strong evidence for <b>intrinsic</b> anaerobic <b>bioremediation.</b> Recently, studies have also revealed that alkylsuccinates are present in oil and coal seam production waters, indicating that anaerobic microbial communities can utilize alkanes in these deeper subsurface environments. In many crude oil reservoirs, the in situ anaerobic metabolism of hydrocarbons such as alkanes may be contibuting to modern-day detrimental effects such as oilfield souring, or may lead to more benefical technologies such as enhanced energy recovery from mature oilfields. In this review, we briefly describe the key metabolic pathways for anaerobic alkane (including n-alkanes, isoalkanes, and cyclic alkanes) metabolism and highlight several field reports wherein alkylsuccinates have provided evidence for anaerobic in situ alkane metabolism in shallow and deep subsurface environments...|$|R

At two sites stimulation of the intrinsic dechlorination processes in a bioactived zone is required, and pilot field tests are currently under way. For three sulphatereducing/methanogenic aquifers contaminated with aromatic compounds, microcosm studies demonstrated that natural anaerobic degradation of the risk-determining benzene does not to occur spontaneously. Benzene biodegradation could be initiated by feeding small amounts of oxygen (in all samples) or nitrate (only in one sample), and these techniques are currently tested in field-pilot studies. Redox-microbiological characterisation of two locations contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexanes indicated significant intrinsic biodegradation of HCH's in methanogenic/sulphate-reducing parts of the contaminant plumes, and of the HCH-degradation products chlorophenol and benzene under sulphate/iron reducing conditons. Biostimulated zone's remain required to complete the degradation of HCH and the degradation product monochlorobenzene.

There, the chemicals pose direct or indirect threats to the environment and to increasingly scarce drinking water resources.

Natural attenuation comprises a wide range of processes of which the microbiological component, which is responsible for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation,</b> can decrease the mass and toxicity of the contaminants and is, therefore, the most important.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Major advances {{have been made}} recently {{in the application of}} molecular biological techniques to environmental settings. The methane oxidizing bacteria, methanotrophs, are ubiquitous in nature and grow on methane as their sole source of carbon and energy. They have important roles in both the global carbon cycle and the degradation of hazardous compounds. Methanotrophs are capable of degrading a number of halogenated compounds including the common groundwater contaminant, trichloroethylene (TCE). In spite of their environmental importance, genetic tools for the methanotrophs have not been widely developed or applied for studying natural populations of these organisms in situ. In this thesis, genes for the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) were cloned from pure cultures of methanotrophs. Using these data and others, robust molecular tools were developed for use in the methanotrophs. These include PCR primers and oligonucleotide probes designed for the 16 S rRNA and [ [...] . ] genes in methanotrophs. The tools were utilized in this study to examine the diversity of methanotrophs in the sediments of Lake Washington, a freshwater lake habitat. The data obtained suggest that the methanotrophs detectable using the newly developed genetic tools demonstrate a diversity as broad as the known methanotrophs from all mesophilic environments. These results are in contrast to other environments, such as peat and marine environments, that appear to be dominated by a limited diversity of methanotrophs. The capacity of the Lake Washington methanotrophic populations for TCE degradation under conditions that mimic <b>intrinsic</b> and enhanced <b>bioremediation</b> protocols was investigated. The changes in the populations were followed by observing methane and TCE oxidation rates in addition to hybridization with methanotroph specific oligonucleotide probes. The data obtained suggest that the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMM 0) is not expressed under methane enrichment conditions typical of enhanced bioremediation protocols. Thus, in situ bioremediation protocols involving methanotrophs will probably involve degradation by the pMMO and not the sMMO, as is currently believed. These results have strong implications for modeling solvent bioremediation by methanotrophs and must be addressed in future designs...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{magnetic}} methods, {{in comparison}} to other analytical methods, are a fast, cost effective and non-destructive approach. Therefore, magnetic proxies are widely used for assessment of heavy metal pollution. However, the relationship between organic contamination, especially hydrocarbon contamination, and magnetic parameters is basically an unexplored research topic. The main goals of the present thesis were (1) to investigate changes of magnetic properties due to hydrocarbon contamination in soils and sediments, (2) {{to examine the relationship}} between non-magnetic parameters and magnetic properties of hydrocarbon contaminated samples, (3) to explore the role of microbial processes for the (trans) formation of magnetic iron minerals and (4) to determine if changes of the magnetic iron mineral content in hydrocarbon contaminated material can be detected with the currently available magnetic equipments and techniques. More importantly, the ultimate goal of this research was to examine if magnetic proxies can be used for the delineation of hydrocarbon contamination of soils and sediments. Two field sites were studied by using magnetic methods for mainly hydrocarbon contaminated soil and sediment samples from the surface and from shallow sub-surface. From the oil-field site, the important finding is a very good correlation between total non-polar hydrocarbon content and magnetic concentration dependent parameters, namely MS and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). In contrast, the correlation between total PAHs content and MS and ARM is lower. Even contaminated sediments that were lying more than a meter below the surface in water saturated condition revealed a 4 -fold higher MS compared to nearby non-contaminated sediments. The most important finding from the military air force base site, according to my knowledge, has never been mentioned in the literature: a significant increase of magnetic concentration dependent parameters appeared in hydrocarbon contaminated unconsolidated sediments that lay in the area of groundwater table fluctuations. From both field site investigations, it was concluded that the enhancement of magnetic concentration parameters was mainly caused by magnetite. Magnetite was found to be predominantly present in a single domain grain size range rather than as ultrafine superparamagnetic particles. However, the role of microorganisms might be quite important at the oil-field site because both iron oxidizers and reducers were present in contaminated sediments as shown by the MPN (most probable number) method. Also, at the military air force base site an important role of microorganisms could be inferred, possibly together with other geochemical processes. The main processes and factors that led to the neoformation of magnetite minerals in the hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater table fluctuations zone at the former military site were: (1) hydrocarbon content, (2) extent of groundwater table fluctuations generated mainly by the remediation method of air sparging that modified static and stratified redox zonations into dynamic and non-stratified redox zonations, respectively, and (3) <b>intrinsic</b> enhanced <b>bioremediation</b> by amendment of nutrients that increased the activity of Comamonas acidovorans. The main process was definitely related with groundwater table fluctuations because an increase of magnetic concentration dependent parameters was not observed at the sampling site without groundwater table fluctuations. Besides the study of hydrocarbon contaminated sites under natural conditions, laboratory batch experiments were set up. In these batch experiments the role of microorganisms, different carbon sources including hydrocarbons, and physical soil properties such as water content were investigated. The soils showed an average change in MS of 7 % in microbial active setups whereas there was no significant change (< 2. 4 %) in sterilized setups. Four soils showed an increase in MS, the other three a decrease. From this result, it was concluded that microorganisms play a significant role in the (trans) formation of magnetic iron minerals. However, the ferro(i) magnetic component which was measured after opening batch bottles at the end of experiments was increased in a soil that also showed an increase of MS during the monitoring period. These measurements confirm that magnetic mineralogical changes happened during the incubation of the soil and that currently available magnetic methods are sensitive enough to monitor these changes. MS monitoring of one soil with different water content in batch experiments revealed that MS increased until a soil to added water ratio of 3 g/ml. Above this ratio, MS had slightly decreasing trend with increasing amount of added water. Obviously, water content plays a versatile role for changes of MS in soils and sediments. This is an additional important aspect of the findings of this study. Furthermore, studies of secondary mineral formation during ferrihydrite reduction by pure cultures Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 revealed that MS measurements can also provide information about ferro(i) magnetic mineral changes during biogeochemical processes. This result demonstrates that even for microbial cultures, MS monitoring can provide an alternative and fast technique that does not require any sampling, in contrast to other geochemical methods. In the present study it is shown that magnetic methods can be used for the assessment and investigation of hydrocarbon contaminated field sites even though main driving factors and processes causing such changes on magnetic properties of contaminated soils or sediments could not be fully clarified. Microorganisms in fact play an important role in modifying the magnetic signal of soils and sediments both at contaminated and clean sites. Im Vergleich zu anderen analytischen Methoden erlaubt die umweltmagnetische Methode eine schnelle, kosteneffiziente und zerstörungsfreie Herangehensweise. Daher sind magnetische Proxies für die Ermittlung von Schwermetallbelastungen weit verbreitet. Jedoch ist der Zusammenhang zwischen organischer Kontamination, insbesondere von Kohlenwasserstoffbelastungen und magnetischen Parametern ein weitestgehend unerforschtes Gebiet. Hauptziele der vorliegenden Arbeit waren (1) die Veränderungen der magnetischen Eigenschaften von kohlenwasserstoffkontaminierten Böden und Sedimenten zu ermitteln, (2) den Zusammenhang zwischen nicht magnetischen Parametern und magnetischen Eigenschaften der kohlenwasserstoffkontaminierten Proben zu untersuchen, (3) die Rolle der mikrobiellen Prozesse für die (Um) Bildung von magnetischen Eisenmineralen zu erforschen und (4) zu bestimmen, ob Veränderungen im Gehalt an magnetischen Eisenmineralen in kohlenwasserstoffkontaminierten Materialien mit den momentan zur Verfügung stehenden magnetischen Messinstrumenten und verfügbaren Techniken detektiert werden kann. Weitaus bedeutender war das übergeordnete Ziel dieser Forschungsarbeit, nämlich zu untersuchen, ob magnetische Proxies zur Ortung von Kohlenwasserstoffkontaminationen in Böden und Sedimenten genutzt werden können. Zwei Feldstandorte wurden untersucht wobei magnetische Methoden vorwiegend bei kohlenwasserstoffkontaminierten Boden- und Sedimentproben direkt von der Erdoberfläche und aus dem oberflächennahen Untergrund angewandt wurden. Der Standort Hänigsen lieferte die wichtige Erkenntnis, dass eine sehr gute Korrelation zwischen dem Gesamtgehalt an unpolaren Kohlenwasserstoffen und den konzentrationsabhängigen magnetischen Parametern MS und anhysteretische remanente Magnetisierung (ARM) besteht. Im Gegensatz dazu war die Korrelation zwischen dem Gesamtgehalt an PAKs und MS und ARM geringer. Auch kontaminierte Sedimente, die mehr als einen Meter unterhalb der Erdoberfläche unter wassergesättigten Bedingungen lagen, zeigten eine vierfach höhere MS verglichen mit benachbarten unbelasteten Sedimenten. Das wichtigste Ergebnis der Untersuchung am Standort Hradzany, eine signifikante Zunahme der konzentrationsabhängigen magnetischen Parameter in kohlenwasserstoff-kontaminierten Lockersedimenten im Bereich von Grundwasserspiegelschwankungen, wurde nach meinem Wissen bisher noch nicht in der Literatur erwähnt.. Aus den Untersuchungen beider Standorte kann gefolgert werden, dass die Zunahme der konzentrationsabhängigen magnetischen Parameter hauptsächlich durch Magnetit verursacht wird. Es wurde festgestellt, dass Magnetit vorwiegend in der Größenordnung von Einbereichsteilchen vorliegt und weniger in Form von ultrafeinen superparamagnetischen Partikeln. Jedoch könnte die Rolle von Mikroorganismen am Standort Hänigsen sehr bedeutend sein, da sowohl eisenoxidierende als auch eisenreduzierende Mikroorganismen in den kontaminierten Sedimenten vorkamen, wie durch die MPN (most probable number) Methode gezeigt werden konnte. Auch die Ergebnisse vom Standort Hrad&# 269;aný lassen auf eine wichtige Rolle von Mikroorganismen schließen, möglicherweise zusammen mit anderen geochemischen Prozessen. Die wichtigsten Prozesse und Faktoren, die zu einer Neubildung von Magnetitmineralen im Schwankungsbereich kohlenwasserstoffbelasteten Grundwassers am ehemaligem Militärstandort Hradzany führten, waren (1) der Kohlenwasserstoffgehalt, (2) das Ausmaß der Grundwasserspiegel-schwankungen, welche hauptsächlich durch die Sanierungsmethode der Bodenluftabsaugung verursacht wurden und statische bzw. stratifizierte Redox-Zonierungen in dynamische bzw. nicht-stratifizierte Redox-Zonierungen umwandelten und (3) intrinsisch verstärkte Biosanierung durch die Zugabe von Nährstoffen, welche die Aktivität von Comamonas acidovorans steigerten. Der Hauptprozess stand zweifellos mit den Grundwasserspiegelschwankungen im Zusammenhang, da die Zunahme konzentrationsabhängiger magnetischer Parameter an Standorten ohne Grundwasserspiegelschwankungen nicht beobachtet wurde. Neben der Untersuchung von kohlenwasserstoffkontaminierten Standorten unter natürlichen Bedingungen wurden im Labor Batchexperimente durchgeführt. In diesen Batchexperimenten wurde die Rolle der Mikroorganismen, verschiedener Kohlenstoffquellen einschließlich Kohlenwasserstoffe und physikalische Bodeneigenschaften wie z. B. Wassergehalt, untersucht. In den mikrobiell aktiven Proben veränderte sich die MS der Böden durchschnittlich um 7 %, wohingegen in den sterilisierten Proben keine signifikante Veränderung (< 2. 4 %) auftrat. Vier Böden zeigten eine Zunahme der MS, die anderen drei eine Abnahme. Aus diesem Ergebnis wurde geschlossen, dass Mikroorganismen eine entscheidende Rolle bei der (Um) Bildung magnetischer Eisenminerale spielen. Jedoch war die ferro(i) magnetische Komponente, die nach dem Öffnen der Batch-Flaschen am Ende des Experiments gemessen wurde, in einem Boden, der auch eine Zunahme der MS während des Messzeitraums zeigte, erhöht. Bestätigte dieses Messergebnis, dass Veränderungen der magnetischen Mineralogie während der Inkubation des Bodens stattgefunden haben und dass die momentan verfügbar magnetische Methodik sensitiv genug sind, diese Veränderungen zu detektieren. Die UNtersuchung einer Bodenprobe mit verschiedenen Wassergehalten im Batch-Experiment zeigte, dass die MS bis zu einem erhältnis von Boden zu zugegebenem Wasser von 3. 0 g/ml anstieg. Über diesem Verhältnis zeigte die MS einen leicht abnehmenden Trend mit zunehmender Menge an zugegebenem Wasser Offensichtlich spielt der Wassergehalt eine vielseitige Rolle für die Veränderung der MS in Sedimenten und Böden. Dies stellt einen weiteren wichtigen Aspekt in den Ergebnissen dieser Studie dar. Darüber hinaus zeigten Untersuchungen der sekundären Mineralbildung während der Ferrihydritreduktion durch Reinkulturen von Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1, dass MS Messungen auch Informationen über ferro(i) magnetische Mineralveränderungen während biogeochemischer Prozesse liefern. Dieses Ergebnis zeigt, dass sogar für mikrobielle Kulturen MS Monitoring eine alternative und schnelle Technik bereitstellen kann, die im Gegensatz zu anderen geochemischen Methoden keine Probennahme erfordert. Aus der vorliegenden Studie geht hervor, dass magnetische Methoden für die Beurteilung und Untersuchung von kohlenwasserstoffbelasteten Standorten genutzt werden können, auch wenn die hauptsächlichen Faktoren und Prozesse, welche Veränderungen der magnetischen Eigenschaften von kontaminiertem Böden bzw. Sedimenten verursachen, nicht vollständig geklärt werden konnten. Mikroorganismen spielen zweifellos eine wichtige Rolle bei der Veränderung des magnetischen Signals von Böden und Sedimenten, sowohl an kontaminierten als auch an nicht kontaminierten Standorten...|$|R

While such metabolites have been detected at numerous sites, the in situ rates of anaerobic hydrocarbon decay remain largely unknown. Yet, realistic rate information is critical for predicting how long individual contaminants will persist and remain environmental threats. Here, single-well push–pull tests were conducted at two fuel-contaminated aquifers to determine the in situ biotransformation rates of a suite of hydrocarbons added as deuterated surrogates, including toluene-d 8, o-xylene-d 10, m-xylene-d 10, ethylbenzene-d 5 (or-d 10), 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene-d 12, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene-d 12, methylcyclohexane-d 14 and n-hexane-d 14. The formation of deuterated fumarate addition and down-stream metabolites was quantified and found to be somewhat variable among wells in each aquifer, but generally within an order of magnitude. Deuterated metabolites formed in one aquifer at rates that ranged from 3 to 50 mg l- 1 day- 1, while the comparable rates at another aquifer were slower and ranged from 0. 03 to 15 mg l- 1 day- 1. An important observation was that the deuterated hydrocarbon surrogates were metabolized in situ within hours or days at both sites, in contrast to many laboratory findings suggesting that long lag periods of weeks to months {{before the onset of}} anaerobic biodegradation are typical.

Of these, Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP {{has become a}} reference strain and {{has been used to}} elucidate sequences of the catabolic enzymes atzA, atzB, atzCand atzD involvedin one aerobic degradation pathway and develop probes for the genes which encode these enzymes. Despite this, hitherto unknown or novel microorganisms, with unique sequences and different enzyme-mediated operative pathways, warrant continued investigations for effective site bioremediation. Also, the sustained effectiveness of natural attenuation must be demonstrated continually so regular site evaluations and results analyses, despite the limitations of chemical extraction methodologies, are crucial practices. For both directed and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> monitoring, traditional microbial association studies must be complemented by more advanced physiological and molecular approaches. The occurrence of catabolic plasmids, in particular, should be probed with DNA hybridization techniques. Also, PCR-DGGEand subsequent new sequenceelucidation should be used prior to developing new primers for DNA sequences encoding novel catabolic enzymes, and for hybridization probe development, to establish the degradative potential of a compromised site, or adoption of FISH to, for example, monitor bioaugmented remediatio...|$|E
40|$|H 2 {{thresholds}} {{have been}} widely used to demonstrate the success of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation,</b> however multiple problems exist in obtaining and interpreting H 2 field data. Acetate and H 2 play similar roles in the metabolism carried out by anaerobic microorganisms, and acetate thresholds have been observed in anaerobic subsurface environments. However, there is little understanding of the factors controlling acetate thresholds. This research used an integrated experimental study of pure cultures and environmental samples, along with microbial respiration modeling, to improve our understanding of acetate thresholds in various terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs). The results demonstrated that acetate thresholds in pure cultures do not necessarily follow thermodynamic trends, as reported in previous studies, and the model evaluations under PCE-dechlorinating and Fe(III) -reducing conditions revealed that kinetics play a greater role in controlling acetate thresholds in these TEAPs. Acetate thresholds measured in the environmental samples were influenced by the initial acetate concentrations. The results of this study improve our understanding of the factors influencing acetate thresholds in pure and mixed cultures and suggest that acetate thresholds may be a useful component of bioremediation monitoring programs...|$|E
40|$|A spill of {{gasoline}} occurred at an automobile service station in 1986. Oily phase residue in the subsurface has, {{for the past}} eight years, continued to release water soluble fuel hydrocarbons into the aquifer. The site was characterized for implementation of intrinsic remediation. The subsurface was a beach sand with sea shell fragments. The water table was near 1. 3 meters below ground surface. Surface dimensions over the plume were about 200 meters downgradient and 60 meters in width. Three points to coincide with direction of ground water flow were selected in the plume for water quality assessments. Both methane and trimethylbenzene were used as surrogate tracers to normalize loss of contaminants. Aerobic respiration and methanogenesis accounted for most biodegradation obtained. Assimilation capacities of dissolved oxygen, ferrous iron, and methane distributions when compared to BTEX concentrations showed that the ground water has sufficient capacity to degrade all dissolved BTEX before the plume moves beyond 250 meters downgradient. Evidence obtained from loss of contaminants, geochemistry and microbial breakdown chemicals showed that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> technology would be a viable option to restore the site.

40|$|Improved {{strategies}} for oil-spill remediation will follow {{a better understanding}} of the nature, activities and regulating parameters of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading microbial communities in temperate marine environments. The addition of crude oil to estuarine water resulted in an immediate change in bacterial community structure, increased abundance of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and a rapid rate of oil degradation, suggesting the presence of a pre-adapted oil-degrading microbial community and sufficient supply of nutrients. Relatively rapid degradation was found at 4 °C, the lowest temperature tested; and it was temperature rather than nutrient addition that most influenced the community structure. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of oil-degrading microcosms showed that known hydrocarbonoclastic organisms like Thalassolituus and Cycloclasticus, as well as proposed oil degraders like Roseobacter, were present at both 4 °C and 20 °C, demonstrating the thermo-versatility of such organisms. Clones related to Oleispira antarctica (98 % 16 S rRNA similarity), a psychrophilic alkane degrader, were dominant in the 4 °C oil-degrading community, whereas other clones constituting a different clade and showing 94 % similarity 16 S rRNA with O. antarctica were found in situ. These findings demonstrate the potential for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> throughout the course of the year in temperate estuarine waters, and highlight the importance of both versatile psychrotolerant and specialized psychrophilic hydrocarbon-degrading microbes in effecting this process at low temperatures. © 2006 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} into the biodegradation potential of a TCE contaminated aquifer located at the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the UK, and the remediation prospects by employing biological and biotechnological processes such as bacterial community structure and diversity assessment, toxicity and isotopic fractionation.   Quarterly monitoring of boreholes from the former military site suggested that the plume is predominantly aerobic and therefore reliance cannot be placed only on natural attenuation.   In addition the contaminated plume contains a variety of volatile organic chemicals, petroleum, diesel and metals, which introduces potential co-metabolites as well as additional toxicity.   Assessment of the natural bacterial community of the site revealed sufficient bacterial counts to support <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> and the presence of multiple additional contaminants.   Variable toxicity responses not solely explainable by TCE were observed with a broad functional bacterial diversity, which could be bio-stimulated (with substrates such as the terpenes carvone, pulegone and linalool as well as the aromatic compound cumene) or bio-augmented (with Dehalosporillium multivorans) to increase rates of TCE degradation.   Other additional agents such as iron filings were able to stimulate rapid rates of TCE degradation.   There is also evidence of potential TCE degraders within the more heavily contaminated boreholes (the finding of Pseudomonas putida).   Lastly isotopic fractionation suggests that degradation of TCE is occurring on site.

40|$|The {{determination}} of compound-specific stable isotope ratios is a promising new tool to assess biodegradation of organic compounds in groundwater. In this study, {{the occurrence of}} carbon isotope fractionation during dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) to ethene was evaluated in a PCE-contaminated aquifer and in a microcosm {{that was based on}} aquifer material from the site. In the microcosm, all dechlorination steps were accompanied by carbon isotope fractionation. The largest fractionation occurred during dechlorination of cis - 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), resulting in a large enrichment of 13 C in the remaining cDCE and VC. Stable carbon isotope ratios (&# 948 13 C) of cDCE and VC increased from - 25. 7 to - 1. 5 ‰ and - 37. 0 to - 2. 5 ‰, respectively. The &# 948 13 C of ethene was initially - 60. 2 ‰ and approached the &# 948 13 C of the added PCE (- 27. 3 ‰) as dechlorination came to completion. A similar carbon isotope pattern was observed for PCE dechlorination at the field site. Strong enrichment of 13 C in cDCE and VC during microbial dechlorination may serve as a powerful tool to monitor the last two dechlorination steps, which frequently determine the rate of complete dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes at field sites undergoing <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to ascertain the effectiveness of isolated indigenous Bacillus species to remove chromium from industrially polluted effluents, through a series of effluent biotreatment regimen. Using microbiological techniques, 6 Bacillus strains were isolated, characterized and labeled QIP 1 - 6. All strains displayed maximum growth on media with a Cr concentration of 400 ppm. Strains QIP 1 and 5 showed maximum resistance to chromium showing moderate growth at 900 ppm of Cr. Following optimization, strain QIP 1 removed 46. 81 % of the Cr 6 + and QIP 5 removed 42. 50 % of the chromium at the same concentration over the same incubation period, as determined through atomic absorption spectroscopy. Following different biotreatment regimens, biotreatment C 1 -filtered effluent inoculated with strain QIP 1, incubated under optimum conditions, showed maximum Cr 6 + removal (10. 29 %) after 48 h. Interestingly, the second highest removal of Cr 6 + (8. 94 %) occurred in the untreated, unfiltered raw effluent (D) after incubation for 48 h. Significant (p< 0. 05) strong positive correlation patterns emerged between these two regimen, as well as between regimen B 1 -filtered effluent inoculated with strain QIP 1, but incubated under un-optimized conditions-and regimen D. The study revealed that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> does occur naturally and that it is quite possible for a consortium of Bacillus species to work more effectively at removing the HM from the contaminated sites, than a single isolate, thereby reducing the labor intensive work involved...|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} {{microbial oxidation}} of toluene to CO 2 coupled to humus respiration was demonstrated {{by use of}} enriched anaerobic sediments from the Amsterdam petroleum harbor (APH) and the Rhine River. Both highly purified soil humic acids (HPSHA) and the humic quinone moiety model compound anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS) were utilized as terminal electron acceptors. After 2 weeks of incubation, 50 and 85 % of added uniformly labeled [13 C]toluene were recovered as 13 CO 2 in HPSHA- and AQDS-supplemented APH sediment enrichment cultures, respectively; negligible recovery occurred in unsupplemented cultures. The conversion of [13 C]toluene agreed with {{the high level of}} recovery of electrons as reduced humus or as anthrahydroquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate. APH sediment was also able to use nitrate and amorphous manganese dioxide as terminal electron acceptors to support the anaerobic biodegradation of toluene. The addition of substoichiometric amounts of humic acids to bioassay reaction mixtures containing amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide as a terminal electron acceptor led to more than 65 % conversion of toluene (1 mM) after 11 weeks of incubation, a result which paralleled the partial recovery of electron equivalents as acid-extractable Fe(II). Negligible conversion of toluene and reduction of Fe(III) occurred in these bioassay reaction mixtures when humic acids were omitted. The present study provides clear quantitative evidence for the mineralization of an aromatic hydrocarbon by humus-respiring microorganisms. The results indicate that humic substances may significantly contribute to the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> of anaerobic sites contaminated with priority pollutants by serving as terminal electron acceptors...|$|E
40|$|Nutrient {{deficiency}} severely impairs the catabolic {{activity of}} indigenous microorganisms in hydrocarbon rich environments (HREs) and limits {{the rate of}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation.</b> The present study aimed to characterize the microbial community in refinery waste and evaluate the scope for biostimulation based in situ bioremediation. Samples recovered from the wastewater lagoon of Guwahati refinery revealed a hydrocarbon enriched high total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), oxygen-, moisture-limited, reducing environment. Intrinsic biodegradation ability of the indigenous microorganisms was enhanced significantly (> 80 % reduction in TPH by 90 days) with nitrate amendment. Preferred utilization of both higher- (>C 30) and middle- chain (C 20 - 30) length hydrocarbons were evident from GC-MS analysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and community level physiological profiling (CLPP) analyses indicated distinct shift in community’s composition and metabolic abilities following nitrogen (N) amendment. High throughput deep sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene showed that the native community was mainly composed of hydrocarbon degrading, syntrophic, methanogenic, nitrate/iron/sulfur reducing facultative anaerobic bacteria and archaebacteria, affiliated to γ- and δ-Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota respectively. Genes for aerobic and anaerobic alkane metabolism (alkB and bssA), methanogenesis (mcrA), denitrification (nirS and narG) and N 2 fixation (nifH) were detected. Concomitant to hydrocarbon degradation, lowering of dissolve O 2 and increase in oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) marked with an enrichment of N 2 fixing, nitrate reducing aerobic/facultative anaerobic members e. g., Azovibrio, Pseudoxanthomonas and Commamonadaceae members was evident in N amended microcosm. This study highlighted that indigenous community of refinery sludge was intrinsically diverse, yet appreciable rate of in situ bioremediation could be achieved by supplying adequate N sources...|$|E
40|$|Seashore {{landfill}} aquifers are environments {{of special}} physicochemical conditions (high organic load and high salinity), and microbes in leachate-polluted aquifers {{play a significant}} role for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation.</b> In order to characterize microbial diversity and look for clues on the relationship between microbial community structure and hydrochemistry, a culture-independent examination of a typical groundwater sample obtained from a seashore landfill was conducted by sequence analysis of 16 S rDNA clone library. Two sets of universal 16 S rDNA primers were used to amplify DNA extracted from the groundwater so that problems arising from primer efficiency and specificity could be reduced. Of 74 clones randomly selected from the libraries, 30 contained unique sequences whose analysis showed that the majority of them belonged to bacteria (95. 9 %), with Proteobacteria (63. 5 %) being the dominant division. One archaeal sequence and one eukaryotic sequence were found as well. Bacterial sequences belonging to the following phylogenic groups were identified: Bacteroidetes (20. 3 %), β, γ, δ and ε-subdivisions of Proteobacteria (47. 3 %, 9. 5 %, 5. 4 % and 1. 3 %, respectively), Firmicutes (1. 4 %), Actinobacteria (2. 7 %), Cyanobacteria (2. 7 %). The percentages of Proteobacteria and Bacteroides in seawater were greater than those in the groundwater from a non-seashore landfill, indicating a possible influence of seawater. Quite a few sequences had close relatives in marine or hypersaline environments. Many sequences showed affiliations with microbes involved in anaerobic fermentation. The remarkable abundance of sequences related to (per) chlorate-reducing bacteria (ClRB) in the groundwater was significant and worthy of further study...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{subsurface}} environments, such as deep-sea sediments, house {{abundant and}} diverse microbial {{communities that are}} believed to influence large-scale geochemical processes. These processes include the biotransformation and mineralization of numerous petroleum constituents. Thus, microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico {{are thought to be}} responsible for the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> of crude oil released by the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. While hydrocarbon contamination is known to enrich for aerobic, oil-degrading bacteria in deep-seawater habitats, relatively {{little is known about the}} response of communities in deep-sea sediments, where low oxygen levels may hinder such a response. Here, we examined the hypothesis that increased hydrocarbon exposure results in an altered sediment microbial community structure that reflects the prospects for oil biodegradation under the prevailing conditions. We explore this hypothesis using metagenomic analysis and metabolite profiling of deep-sea sediment samples following the DWH oil spill. The presence of aerobic microbial communities and associated functional genes was consistent among all samples, whereas, a greater number of Deltaproteobacteria and anaerobic functional genes were found in sediments closest to the DWH blowout site. Metabolite profiling also revealed a greater number of putative metabolites in sediments surrounding the blowout zone relative to a background site located 127 km away. The mass spectral analysis of the putative metabolites revealed that alkylsuccinates remained below detection levels, but a homologous series of benzylsuccinates (with carbon chain lengths from 5 to 10) could be detected. Our findings suggest that increased exposure to hydrocarbons enriches for Deltaproteobacteria, which are known to be capable of anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism. We also provide evidence for an active microbial community metabolizing aromatic hydrocarbons in deep-sea sediments of the Gulf of Mexi...|$|E
40|$|At a field {{site in the}} {{industrial}} area of Vilvoorde, Belgium, we investigated {{the capacity of the}} indigenous microbial community of a eutrophic river sediment to biodegrade chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) originating from discharging, polluted groundwater using a compound-specific isotope approach. We specifically targeted the site's major pollutants cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). Analysis of Rayleigh correlation plots enabled us to assess the Went to which microbial and abiotic natural attenuation processes contributed to the mitigation of a pollution of the surface water due to discharging CAH-contaminated groundwater. Our results provide evidence for (i) the occurrence of biodegradation of cis-DCE and VC by reductive dechlorination in parts of the aquifer and at several positions in the river sediment, (ii) the presence of river sediment zones exhibiting attenuation of chloroethenes by a combination of biodegradation and dilution through unpolluted water, (iii) the existence of zones in the river sediment lacking significant biodegradation, and thus (iv) a pronounced spatial heterogeneity in the occurrence and extent of biodegradation in the aquifer and river sediment, We conclude that at many investigated positions in the river sediment the indigenous microbial community failed to facilitate complete biodegradation of the groundwater-sourced chloroethenes. The overall <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation</b> capacity of the river sediment was thus not high enough to completely prevent the release of these pollutants into the surface water. These findings and conclusions are thus in agreement with those of our companion paper (1), which investigated the river sediments at the Vilvoorde study site by a combination of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis of water and the detection of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) and their dechlorination products. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A culture {{independent}} molecular phylogenetic {{approach was}} used to survey constituents of microbial communities associated with an aquifer contaminated with hydrocarbons (mainly jet fuel) and chlorinated solvents undergoing <b>intrinsic</b> <b>bioremediation.</b> Samples were obtained from three redox zones: methanogenic, methanogenic-sulfate reducing, and iron or sulfate reducing, Small-subunit rRNA genes were amplified directly from aquifer material DNA by PCR with universally conserved or Bacteria- or Archaea-specific primers and were cloned. A total of 812 clones were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), approximately 50 % of which were unique. All RFLP types that occurred {{more than once in}} the libraries, as well as many of the unique types, were sequenced. A total of 104 (94 bacterial and 10 archaeal) sequence types were determined. Of the 94 bacterial sequence types, 10 have no phylogenetic association with known taxonomic divisions and are phylogenetically grouped in six novel division level groups (candidate divisions WS 1 to WS 6); 21 belong to four recently described candidate divisions with no cultivated representatives (OP 5, OP 8, OP 10, and OP 11); and 63 are phylogenetically associated with 10 well-recognized divisions. The physiology of two particularly abundant sequence types obtained from the methanogenic zone could be inferred from their phylogenetic association with groups of microorganisms with a consistent phenotype, One of these sequence types is associated with the genus Syntrophus; Syntrophus spp, produce energy from the anaerobic oxidation of organic acids, with the production of acetate and hydrogen. The organism represented by the other sequence type is closely related to Methanosaeta spp., which are known to be capable of energy generation only through aceticlastic methanogenesis. We hypothesize, therefore, that the terminal step of hydrocarbon degradation in the methanogenic zone of the aquifer is aceticlastic methanogenesis and that the microorganisms represented by these two sequence types occur in syntrophic association...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to disclose the effects and mechanism of midazolam (MDZ) on the proliferation and apoptosis of astrocytes under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) condition. Methods: The astrocytes were assigned randomly into four groups: control group, OGD group, OGD+MDZ group, and OGD+MDZ+IL- 6 group. The astrocytes were treated with MDZ at dose of 10 μmol/L in OGD+MDZ group. And in OGD+MDZ+IL- 6 group, the astrocytes were treated with MDZ at dose of 10 μmol/L and IL- 6 at dose of 50 ng/mL. MTT assay was used to assess cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL apoptosis assay kit and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the expression of JAK 2, p-JAK 2, STAT 3, p-STAT 3, Bcl- 2, Bax and Caspase- 3 proteins were determined by western blotting assay. Results: Astrocytes proliferation was decreased obviously in OGD group, while MDZ could increase astrocytes proliferation under OGD condition. Moreover, OGD could induce apoptosis in astrocytes and MDZ could play an anti-apoptotic role. However, IL- 6, a JAK 2 activator, could attenuate cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects of MDZ in astrocytes. In addition, the expression of Bcl- 2 protein in MDZ group increased markedly, while the JAK 2 /STAT 3 signal proteins, Bax and Caspase- 3 proteins decreased relative to OGD group. But IL- 6 could counteract the anti-apoptotic effects of MDZ. Conclusion: Midazolam has protective effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of astrocytes via JAK 2 /STAT 3 signal pathway in vitro. We firstly disclose the beneficial roles of midazolam in astrocytes under ischemic condition, which may be a rational treatment selection for ischemic cerebral protection...|$|E
