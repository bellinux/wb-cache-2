5|$|Various {{dates for}} the burial of the hoard have been proposed, largely derived from {{considerations}} regarding {{the origin of}} the objects themselves and their manner of burial, though the inscription has also been an important factor (see below).

5|$|Clan MacAulay <b>dates,</b> <b>with</b> certainty, to the 16th century. The clan {{was engaged}} in several feuds with {{neighbouring}} clans. However, the clan's fortunes declined in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the decline and fall of Clan MacAulay, which ended {{with the death of}} Aulay MacAulay in the mid-18th century, the clan became dormant. With the revival of interest in Scottish clans in the 20th century a movement was organised to revive Clan MacAulay. The modern organisation strove to unite the three unrelated groups of MacAulays, and all who bore the surname MacAulay, under one clan and chief. In 2002, the clan appointed a potential chief of Clan MacAulay, but his petition for formal recognition was denied by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The Lord Lyon ruled that the petitioner did not meet two criteria: anyone without a blood link to a past chief must be Clan Commander for ten years before being considered for recognition, and that the chiefship in question was of the MacAulays of Ardincaple and not of all MacAulays. To date, Clan MacAulay does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, and therefore can be considered an Armigerous clan.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{completely}} {{dropped out}} of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, Silent Cry reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold.

5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available <b>dates</b> <b>with</b> the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E

5|$|The 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season {{included}} Cyclone Inigo, which {{tied with}} Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 {{as the most}} intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin. It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003. The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season, which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E. The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these <b>dates,</b> <b>with</b> the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.
