According to the results, home delivery transportation costs using the shared reception box concept are 55 - 66 % lower than those of the current standard home delivery model with attended reception and 2 -hour delivery time windows. This cost reduction alone justifies the two-to-five-year payback period of the investment required, even if there is only a fairly small number of deliveries per day. Compared similarly, using customer-specific reception boxes in home delivery operations leads to a cost reduction of 44 - 53 %. Because of the high investments involved in customer-specific reception boxes, the payback period, based on the cost savings, is 6 - 13 years. This requires customer involvement in investment. These results show that the most cost-efficient e-grocery home delivery model is based on unattended reception, which enables the optimal routing and scheduling of delivery vehicles. It would also be the best solution when considering the environmental aspects. Usage of e-grocery home delivery services offers a notable potential for traffic reduction when compared to the situation in which customers visit the shop using their own cars. In the selected test area, the reduction would be between 54 and 93 per cent, depending on the home delivery model used. However, the total traffic reduction and reduction of traffic emissions depends greatly on the e-grocery market share in the future. reviewe...|$|E

But in fact many customer complaints are heard in the newspaper and electronic media. From PDAM of Denpasar city annual report in 2013, there were 6, 738 cases of complaints regarding service and 83. 38 percent came from the technical aspect. This research aims to determine the level of customer satisfaction, the indicators that affect customer satisfaction and indicators affecting what should be improved to increase customer satisfaction reviewed from technical aspect. This research was conducted in Denpasar city with the 398 respondents who are <b>household</b> <b>customer</b> PDAM of Denpasar. The analysis took based on the Importance-Performance analysis and Gap analysis. Importance-Performance analysis resulted in indicators of influence and should be improved to increase customer satisfaction. While the Gap analysis  showed the level of customer satisfaction PDAM of Denpasar city. The majority of customer were dissatisfied with the service received from technical aspects. Shown from the Gap of - 1. 01 and suitability level of performance and the importance is worth 0. 76 (less than 1). The level of customer satisfaction PDAM Denpasar city for complaints of the piping aspect (- 1. 09) is at a low level satisfaction (- 1, 059 < I < - 1, 01), while satisfaction level for the water quality (- 0. 982), water continuity (- 0. 975), speed installation of new connections (- 1. 003) and water meters (- 0. 973) are at moderate levels of satisfaction(- 1, 01 < I < - 0, 961). The indicators that affect customer satisfaction are the clarity of the water, smelly water, flavored water, chemical content, hours of availability of water in the life activity, alertness operators in the installation of new connection, reading the water meter, water meter repair damage, and alertness/speed handling of complaints about the piping. Some performance indicators should be improved by the PDAM of Denpasar city to improve customer satisfaction are the clarity of the water, the smell of the water, the availability of water at life activity, alertness operators in the installation of new connections, water meters repair damage, and alertness/speed handling of complaints about the piping. </p...|$|E

40|$|Modern <b>household</b> <b>customers</b> use many power {{electronic}} based devices for their daily usage. Those devices emit harmonic current pollutions and eventually increase harmonic voltage distortion {{level in the}} network. In the future network, the background harmonic pollution in the MV and upstream networks could increase with the integration of more distributed generations. Thus, the harmonic related problem will increase in the network and therefore should be considered seriously. With the distorted supply voltage, most of the devices produce even more harmonic current pollutions. In this paper, three typical households are modeled with their various connected devices. Each device is tested in the laboratory to find out its harmonic current emission spectrum for different grid voltage conditions. Also, harmonic current spectrums are measured in the laboratory {{at each of the}} three house model's terminal. Further, harmonic simulation is done on a typical low voltage network in which several <b>household</b> <b>customers</b> are connected and the above measured harmonic spectrums of households are used in the analysis. Harmonic current emission levels at different points of the network are calculated. Those values are compared with the laboratory measurements and also with the available standard limits. This analysis gives an overview of harmonic current emission level at different installations of a low voltage network...|$|R

Currently, three different hypotheses have been formulated and are still under discussion. All of them propose a trinomial structure, made up of a fixed part and of two variable components, defined respectively {{as a function of the}} peak power demand and of the energy demand. The main purpose of this contribution is to investigate how the reform of the electricity tariffs could affect the diffusion of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) in support of Distributed Generation (DG) based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). ESS have recently been subject of great interest among the energy market, due to their possible role in the increase of the host capacity of RES. The installation of ESS could help to overcome the main drawbacks of RES (i. e. intermittency and uncertainty), by increasing the share of self-consumption and improving the reliability of electricity distribution systems. Nevertheless, the economic feasibility of the installation of ESS is still uncertain, because the revenues coming from the increase of self-consumption are usually not sufficient to cover the investment costs.

Today, market liberalisation encourages the development of hubs and spot markets, where supply and demand can be balanced by the pricing mechanism.
