2500|$|Buffalo Bill {{would not}} discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and said it was}} too bad to talk about. While Cody did not {{participate}} in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair. The engagement, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{ends with}} the Capellos assuring Jeremy that they love him and want to help him deal with his [...] "problem". Jeremy then {{introduces}} Darla to his delightfully surprised parents, while Ralph <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> at the whole hubbub.|$|R
50|$|The {{next person}} David meets is an elderly man, {{who came to}} the emporium by accident. He {{eventually}} admits he lost the respect of his children, and David grudgingly points him (with help of the orb) to a mirror, which he should look at for no less than five and a half minutes. The man begins this procedure, but is disgusted by what he sees—a distorted, monstrous image of him. Unable to control himself, he smashes the mirror, then realizes what he has done. And just like with the old woman, David <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and leaves.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Leopold came in <b>just</b> then, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> dubiously. He was {{not going}} to spend Christmas with Edward and Geraldine, and perhaps the {{prospect}} of having to cook and eat his Christmas dinner all alone made him pessimistic.|$|R

5000|$|I cannot say {{specifically}} {{where your}} father and Mrs. Hubbard were when the torpedoes hit, but I can tell you just what happened after that. They emerged from their room, which was {{on the port side}} of the vessel, and came on to the boat-deck.Neither appeared perturbed in the least. Your father and Mrs. Hubbard linked arms—the fashion in which they always walked the deck—and stood apparently wondering what to do. I passed him with a baby which I was taking to a lifeboat when he said, 'Well, Jack, they have got us. They are a damn sight worse than I ever thought they were.'They did not move very far away from where they originally stood. As I moved {{to the other side of}} the ship, in preparation for a jump when the right moment came, I called to him, 'What are you going to do?' and he <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> while Mrs. Hubbard smiled and said, 'There does not seem to be anything to do.' The expression seemed to produce action on the part of your father, for then he did one of the most dramatic things I ever saw done. He simply turned with Mrs. Hubbard and entered a room on the top deck, the door of which was open, and closed it behind him.It was apparent that his idea was that they should die together, and not risk being parted on going into the water.|$|E
5000|$|The next day, a bus {{arrives at}} Kadic. It drops off {{a student and}} his dog. They're named Odd and Kiwi, respectively. Odd is greeted by Jeremie, who also {{introduces}} him to his friend, Ulrich. Jeremie makes a comment about Kiwi, saying something about him looking [...] "really dumb." [...] Odd claims Kiwi is very sensitive and can get mean, and pushes the dog into Jeremie's face. Jeremie believes him at first, but Odd quickly reveals the act to be a joke (showing off his goofball smile). Ulrich <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> in disbelief. Some time later, while showing Odd around the school, Jeremie points out Yumi, who is practicing Pencak Silat with Ulrich. Jeremie makes sure {{to point out that}} getting on her bad side is not a good idea. As the two practice, Yumi eventually throws Ulrich to the floor and pins him. After a short stint of heavy breathing, Yumi blushes.|$|R
5000|$|... 22. Picture of ParadiseWhen Zeke {{finds out}} Maxine {{is on her}} way to a summer camp for a week, he tries to impress her by saying he's really into camping too. Jay scoff's at Zeke's bravado and Zeke scoffs back at Jay - don't worry, I've got my Pad. In fact, Zeke draws himself, Jay and the family in the {{campground}} next to Maxine's 'girls camp' in order to use the opportunity to impress her more. After several bumbling attempts to show Max his camping know-how go awry, Zeke drags Jay along to follow Maxine in a wilderness walk, with a plan to help her out when she gets lost. Unfortunately, it is Zeke and Jay who get lost and even the Pad's GPS can't help them. But when Maxine witnesses Zeke unwittingly saving his family from a bear, she's more than impressed and joins the family back for some of Ida's risotto over the open fire. Jay <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> not believing Zeke's luck.|$|R
5000|$|Unimpressed by Waterhouse's acting ability, Tom Baker {{suggested}} that, [...] "Because of his amazing appearance, Matthew {{should have}} played Adric like Sabu - a little wild boy who couldn't speak. I {{would talk to}} him rather like Basil Fawlty talks to Manuel, and he'd <b>just</b> nod or <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> But John Nathan-Turner didn't like that idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would the}} {{ordinary}} thief get his money without being detected? Who would dare {{to walk into}} Garnett's shop with the diamonds {{in his hands and}} ask for the four hundred pounds? Besides, they have been sold to some one,--and, as I believe, to my dear friend, Mr. Benjamin. 'I suppose you ain't a-going anywhere just at present, Lord George?' said that fellow Gager. 'What the devil's that to you?' I asked him. He <b>just</b> laughed and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> I don't doubt but that there's a policeman about waiting till I leave this house;--or looking at me now with a magnifying glass from the windows at the other side. They've photographed me while I'm going about, and published a list of every hair on my face in the 'Hue and Cry.' I dined at the club yesterday, and found a strange waiter. I feel certain that he was a policeman done up in livery all for my sake. I turned sharp round in the street yesterday, and found a man at a corner. I am sure that man was watching me, and was looking at my pockets to see whether the jewel case was there. As for myself, I can think of nothing else. I wish I had got them. I should have something then to pay me for all this nuisance." ...|$|R
