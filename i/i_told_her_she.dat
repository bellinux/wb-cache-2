[...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E

6000|$|... "I shouldn't 'ave let her in, only she's {{been three}} times, {{and she seemed}} that upset at not finding you, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> could wait." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>she</b> {{repeated}} the name with great contempt--Elise.|$|R

6000|$|... "Whither {{and nowhere}} else I will go," [...] said Benoni, [...] "to share in my nation's death or triumph. If Miriam wills it, <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> can leave me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Lucas came to {{stay with}} me, but I didn't want her," [...] said Janet, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> might go home to dinner. It's father-—" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{says you}} are very kind, but that she cannot. I said {{everything}} I could; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> should wear Sophy's muslin mantle, or my second best polka.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, about Stella. Didn't I {{say that}} Alfred would fix things for George? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> looked worried, {{and got her}} {{to tell me what}} the trouble was. And then----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Silence {{would have}} been unfair. I don't think it {{would have been}} kind either. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> must be {{prepared}} for the world passing a very severe judgment on her father..." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> {{was wrong}} then. She {{ought to have}} been {{thinking}} of her life, and not only of her life but {{of the life of the}} man who was speaking to <b>her</b> too. <b>She</b> let me finish, then shook her head impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about you. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> because <b>she</b> {{came to see}} me and was very kind. You will have nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any {{difference}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "she must have taken more {{interest}} in the exercises than you did, for it is long past the time when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> must be home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And--do you know, she {{sat down}} and CRIED when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> couldn't have the flat after all." [...] "It was simply a BARGAIN, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not everything, {{but most}} things. And she didn't tell {{me so much}} as I guessed it. She'll tell me more the next time. She'll behave {{properly}} now about coming in to see me; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> ought to." ...|$|E
6000|$|ALBANO: In truth <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>she</b> {{smiled and}} said, 'If I am Venus, thou, coy Poesy, [...] 10 Art the Adonis whom I love, and he The Erymanthian boar that wounded him.' O trust to me, Signor Malpiglio, Those nods and smiles were favours worth the zechin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> is {{disposed}} {{to treat it}} as an absurd fancy on my part, but if I can get anything to go upon which will convince her that {{there is even a}} faint possibility of my being right, she will go through fire and water to assist me." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a weak {{complaint}} to have made, and I had {{not meant to}} make it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so, as <b>she</b> sat brooding after this outburst.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Miss Ada, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> must be mistaken, but {{she stuck}} to it, though {{she said she}} never would have breathed a word if Miss Gillian had not come back again, but she thought you should know it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ada {{told me one}} {{day that}} Percy had asked her the reason of my {{remaining}} away so; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> {{had no one to}} blame but herself, who had made me uncomfortable by talking nonsense to me about him.|$|E
60|$|Nothing had {{happened}} to alarm Marian during my absence. She asked eagerly what success I had met with. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> could not conceal her surprise at the indifference with which I spoke {{of the failure of}} my investigations thus far.|$|E
60|$|In {{alluding}} to Eunice, she had blundered, strangely enough, {{on something like}} the truth. But when she spoke of herself, the headlong malignity of her suspicions--making every allowance for the anger that had hurried her into them--seemed to call for some little protest against a false assertion. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> was completely mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing that I {{could get}} out of her," [...] replied Robina; [...] "you know <b>her</b> way--how <b>she</b> chums on with anybody and everybody. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> if <b>she</b> had been {{attending}} to her duties instead of staring out of the window, she would not have seen him. He happened to be crossing the field just at the time." ...|$|R
50|$|Anushka: I knew Sweety (Anushka Shetty) {{even before}} she entered movies. It was me who {{introduced}} her to Puri Jagannadh for Super. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> {{is going to be}} paired up with Prabhas and I need her in best shape. She worked hard and when I met her after two months, she slimmed down a lot.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell whether}} she's sick or not. I {{went to see}} about her and she motioned me away, and fairly screamed when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> ought to keep out in the air. Well, I must be going up again myself, or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, a dying man's {{request is}} sacred. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> should see him. I made her follow me upstairs, and wait outside his room. I promised {{to let her}} know if he {{recovered}} consciousness. I have never been thanked like that, before or since.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have won!" [...] she cried. [...] "Antony {{came down}} {{last night and}} brought us the news. Then Gertrude was over this morning and could talk of nothing else. She said you were splendid, and she got quite vexed when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> needn't speak as if she hadn't {{expected}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|When not a {{state but}} {{a change of}} state is {{referred}} to, the expression is quedar contento or alegrarse: Ella quedó muy contenta cuando yo le dije que ella había ganado = [...] "she was very glad when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> had won"; Yo me alegro de que vosotros hayáis llegado = [...] "I am glad that ye have come".|$|R
60|$|For {{two hours}} or more we talked, and when I had heard <b>her</b> story <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> mine, and <b>she</b> wept for me, since with all her faults Marina's heart was ever gentle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You do not? I cannot make out. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> was {{at liberty}} to do as she pleased; I only warned her neither to trifle with him, nor to rush into an {{engagement}} without deliberation, but I could get nothing like an answer. She {{was in one of}} her perverse fits, and I have no notion whether she means to accept him or not.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> {{seemed to}} be so {{perfectly}} sensible of my condition, that I had nothing to ask of her but this, that as I {{had told her that}} I had money sufficient, but not a great quantity, she would order it so that I might be at as little superfluous charge as possible.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> was tired, and I was sorry. I {{put my hand}} {{upon her}} head, and touched her forehead, {{and said it was}} hot now but would be cool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and {{frowning}} at me, but presently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s like this," [...] {{said the}} farmer. [...] "Young Pascoe has been hanging round after my girl Celia, though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> wasn’t {{to have nothing}} to do with him. Half an hour ago I was going to put my pony in its stable when I see a young man sitting there waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sammy {{shook his}} head. [...] "I'm {{going to tell}} <b>her</b> when <b>she</b> comes back here to-night," [...] he explained. [...] "I was afraid if <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> before then <b>she</b> would fly {{straight}} to him and perhaps get them both in trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|JONES. [Who leans {{with his}} arms on the dock behind, speaks in a slow, sullen voice.] Wot I say is wot my wife says. I 've never been 'ad up in a police court before, an' I can prove I took it when in liquor. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>she</b> {{can tell you the}} same, that I was goin' to throw the thing into the water sooner then 'ave it on my mind.|$|R
6000|$|Will {{you believe}} me that I {{had to tell her}} what it was? And when <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> exclaimed with {{extraordinary}} callousness, [...] "The book? I had forgotten all about the book!" [...] And then after reflection she added, [...] "Pooh!" [...] Had she not added Pooh I might have spared her, but as it was I raised the blotting-pad rather haughtily and presented her with the sheet beneath it.|$|R
