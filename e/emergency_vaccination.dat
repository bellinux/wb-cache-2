This policy change raised two questions: can <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{be as effective as}} pre-emptive culling, and what are the implications for showing freedom of infection? Here, we integrate quantitative information available on CSF virus transmission and vaccination effects into a stochastic mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics at the level of animals, farms and livestock areas. This multilevel approach connects individual-level interventions to large-scale effects. Using this model, we compare the performance of five different control strategies applied to hypothetical CSF epidemics in The Netherlands and, for each of these strategies, we study the properties of three different screening scenarios to show freedom of infection. We find that vaccination in a ring of 2  km radius around a detected infection source is as effective as ring culling in a 1  km radius. Feasible screening scenarios, adapted to the use of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination,</b> can reduce the enhanced risks of (initially) undetected farm outbreaks by targeting vaccinated farms.

In {{order to reduce the}} economic damage for an outbreak, different strategies to control HPAI are evaluated. In a first stage the structure of the Belgium poultry sector is described and risks are analysed. The actual risks are dependent of the intensive character of poultry farming in Belgium, the large number of transport movements of living poultry, the presence of sensitive nature areas and the border with the Netherlands where the poultry density is even larger. In a second stage the possible intervention strategies are evaluated. Starting from the current regulation, two strategies are worked out: stamping out and <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The success of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is associated with the correct identification of compartments at risk, prompt deployment of emergency vaccines, rapid enforcement of appropriate complementary control measures and also the level of being ready.

40|$|AbstractTo {{eliminate}} incursions of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} (FMD) quickly, {{a combination of}} measures, including <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination,</b> can help block the spread of infection. For the earliest recovery of the FMD-free status for trade, without the slaughter of uninfected vaccinated animals, a serosurvey for antibodies to FMD virus non-structural proteins (NSP) must be used to substantiate absence of occult virus infections. Areas of doubt over requirements for post-vaccination serosurveillance and its feasibility include the required and achievable confidence, the amount of sampling necessary, and the appropriate responses to and consequences of different seropositive findings. This derives largely from uncertainty over the extent of localised pockets of virus infection that may remain within vaccinated populations and the circumstances that permit this. The question therefore remains whether tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect and eliminate infected animals, without excessive culling of uninfected animals, before vaccinated animals mix with non-vaccinated livestock when movement restrictions are lifted. It is recommended to change the rationale for serosurveillance after <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Only when <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is used in limited outbreaks {{is it possible to}} test and cull comprehensively, an approach compatible with a three-month minimum period to recover the FMD-free status. In other situations, where <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is used, such as dealing with large outbreaks in animal-dense regions and where the onset of vaccination has been delayed, post-vaccination serosurveys should be targeted and focus on providing an assurance to detect higher levels of infection, in case of inadequate control measures. As this provides less assurance of absence of infection, the approach would be compatible with a six-month waiting period for free-status recovery and should be complemented by other methods to provide evidence that vaccination and control measures have been effectively implemented, as these are the best guarantee against continuing virus transmission...|$|E

States also differed in their campaign processes and decisions. Analyzing the campaign provides an opportunity to identify specific approaches that may result in higher vaccine uptake in a future event of this nature. ObjectiveTo determine supply chain and system factors associated with higher state H 1 N 1 vaccination coverage for adults in a system where vaccine was {{in short supply}}. MethodsRegression analysis of factors predicting state-specific H 1 N 1 vaccination coverage in adults. Independent variables included state campaign information, demographics, preventive or health-seeking behavior, preparedness funding, providers, state characteristics, and H 1 N 1 -specific state data. ResultsThe best model explained the variation in state-specific adult vaccination coverage with an adjusted R-squared of 0. 76. We found that higher H 1 N 1 coverage of adults is associated with program aspects including shorter lead-times (i. e., {{the number of days}} between when doses were allocated to a state and were shipped, including the time for states to order the doses) and less vaccine directed to specialist locations. Higher vaccination coverage is also positively associated with the maximum number of ship-to locations, past seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, the percentage of women with a Pap smear, the percentage of the population that is Hispanic, and negatively associated with a long duration of the epidemic peak. ConclusionLong lead-times may be a function of system structure or of efficiency and may suggest monitoring or redesign of distribution processes. Sending vaccine to sites with broad access could be useful when covering a general population. Existing infrastructure may be reflected in the maximum number of ship-to locations, so strengthening routine influenza vaccination programs may help during <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccinations</b> also.

Scientific-based preparedness about how to best control the disease in a previously FMD-free country is therefore essential for veterinary services. The present study used a spatial, stochastic epidemic simulation model to compare the effectiveness of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> with conventional (non-vaccination) control measures in Switzerland, a low-livestock density country. Model results revealed that <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> with a radius of 3 km or 10 km around infected premises (IP) did not significantly reduce either the cumulative herd incidence or epidemic duration if started in a small epidemic situation where the number of IPs is still low. However, in a situation where the epidemic has become extensive, both the cumulative herd incidence and epidemic duration are reduced significantly if vaccination were implemented with a radius of 10 km around IPs. The effect of different levels of conventional strategy measures was also explored for the non-vaccination strategy. It was found that a lower compliance level of farmers for movement restrictions and delayed culling of IPs significantly increased both the cumulative IP incidence and epidemic duration. Contingency management should therefore focus mainly on improving conventional strategies, by increasing disease awareness and communication with stakeholders and preparedness of culling teams in countries with a livestock structure similar to Switzerland; however, <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> should be considered if there are reasons to believe that the epidemic may become extensive, such as when disease detection has been delayed and many IPs are discovered at the beginning of the epidemic...|$|E

All vaccination strategies were found to be preferable to a culling only strategy. However, the optimal vaccination radius was found to be highly dependent upon vaccination capacity for all management objectives.

Following on an unsuccessful manual bait distribution campaign, vaccine baits were aerially distributed by helicopters using a satellite-navigated, computer-supported, automatic bait drop system. The flight paths were traced with distance of 500 - 1, 000 m from one another to optimise helicopter missions and guarantee homogeneous coverage of the vaccination area. The vaccine distribution was evaluated by superimposing a 1 km-step grid and weighing the number of baits per cell. The implementation of a geographical information system for the management of vaccine distribution proved to be useful, both for the planning and execution phases, of the campaigns. It supported effective management of the flights and allowed near real-time monitoring of the campaigns. In addition, it facilitated the identification of areas with suboptimal bait density that would require additional flights or supplementary, manual distributio...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess, via a {{tabletop}} exercise, {{the ability}} of a rural health unit to manage an influenza pandemic. Participants: The exercise brought together community stakeholders including representation from public health, hospitals, long-term care, social services, first responders, morticians, local government and the media. Setting: Leeds, Grenville and Lanark, a rural region of Ontario. Intervention: In June 2002, exercise participants were presented with a scenario involving the local response to pandemic influenza. Facilitators prepared a framework for the mock emergency in advance. However, the scenario was guided by decisions made by participants and the probable consequences of those decisions. Following the exercise, a debriefing session identified recommendations to be included in future plan development. Outcomes: The exercise identified critical issues, including communication, <b>emergency</b> decision-making, <b>vaccination</b> priorization, local surge capacity, and disease containment. Both participants and observers deemed the exercise successful. Conclusion: Improvements in the local contingency plan for pandemic influenza were identified. The exercise was an opportunity to familiarize participants with the contingency plan, practice working collectively and identify areas for further planning. The principles and lessons generated from the exercise can be used to guide the response to other large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. Influenza pandemics cause global devas-tation through unprecedented propor-tions of morbidity and mortality. The influenza virus periodically undergoes a major antigenic shift resulting in a ‘new’ virus to which the population has no immunity. Pandemic influenza is a global outbreak resulting from these major anti-genic changes. Although experts are certain that another influenza pandemic will occur, the timing and pattern is unpre-dictable. In the last century, three pan...|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{waiting for}} a {{decision}} asylum seekers have limited rights {{in the country of}} asylum. In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer. In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country. Even access to health care is limited. In the European Union, those who have yet to be granted official status as refugees and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access. This includes access to medical and psychological care. However, these may vary depending on the host country. For instance, under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act in Germany, asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to <b>emergency</b> health care, <b>vaccinations,</b> pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care. [...] Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population. They also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapists relative to the German general population.|$|R
