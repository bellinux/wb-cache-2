It became a bestseller. In March 2003, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water was the third-best-selling religious book in Britain and the fourth-best-selling religious book in Scotland. In his book God Can't Sleep: Waiting for Daylight On Life's Dark Nights, Palmer Chinchen writes that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is an [...] "excellent book on faith". Religion News Service journalist Jonathan Merritt called the book a modern classic book. In 2002, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water received the Christianity Today Book Award in the Christian Living category. Carol Rodman of The Commercial Appeal called the book [...] "challenging". Willow Creek Community Church placed the book on its Essential Reading List. Mary Milla of St. Paul Pioneer Press said that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is [...] "a must-read for anyone considering a career change ... It gives you the confidence {{you need to make}} a change, but without taking chances that wouldn't be the right fit for you".|$|R

'No, I {{destroyed}} it; but I {{remember that}} he said that a man had arrived at his station who declared that two months' journey beyond Mt Lekakisera, which no white man has yet visited -- at least, so far as I know -- he found a lake called Laga, and that then {{he went off to}} the north-east, a month's journey, over desert and thorn veldt and great mountains, till he came to a country where the people are white and live in stone houses. Here he was hospitably entertained for a while, till at last the priests of the country set it about that he was a devil, and the people drove him away, and he journeyed for eight months and reached Mackenzie's place, as I heard, dying. That's all I know; and if you ask me, I believe that it is a lie; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out more about it, you had better go up the Tana to Mackenzie's place and ask him for information.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{everything}} was complete {{he looked out}} of the door, and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood. Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman's clothes, but, as he was a magician, assumed her form as well. Then he took the wood, kindled the fire, and very soon set a large dinner before the old man, who was very hungry, and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy. But when the Tanuki {{saw that he had}} eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner, he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape. Then he said to the peasant, 'You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them! You are caught in your own net. It is your own wife that you have eaten, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> her bones you have only to look under the floor.' With these words he turned and made for the forest.|$|E

60|$|Let {{us up and}} onward to {{that long}} still reach, which is now curling up fast before the breeze; there are large fish to be taken, one or two at least, even before the fly comes on. You need not change your flies; the cast which you have on--governor, and black alder--will take, if {{anything}} will. Only do not waste your time and muscle, as you are beginning to do, by hurling your flies wildly {{into the middle of}} the stream, on the chance of a fish being there. Fish are there, no doubt, but not feeding ones. They are sailing about and enjoying the warmth; but nothing more. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the hungry fish and to kill them, you must stand well back from the bank--or kneel down, if you are really in earnest about sport; and throw within a foot of the shore, above you or below (but if possible above), with a line short enough to manage easily; by which I mean short enough to enable you to lift your flies out of the water at each throw without hooking them in the docks and comfrey which grow along the brink. You must learn to raise your hand at the end of each throw, and lift the flies clean over the land-weeds: or you will lose time, and frighten all the fish, by crawling to the bank to unhook them. Believe me, one of the commonest mistakes into which young anglers fall is that of fishing in 'skipjack broad;' in plain English, in mid-stream, where few fish, and those little ones, are to be caught. Those who wish for large fish work close under the banks, and seldom take a mid-stream cast, unless they see a fish rise there.|$|E
