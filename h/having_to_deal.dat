5|$|The episode's plot {{depicts the}} {{deterioration}} of the political balance of the seven kingdoms, with Eddard Stark <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the Lannister aggressions while King Robert is away on a hunt. At the Eyrie, Tyrion is put on trial, and across the Narrow Sea, Viserys Targaryen is determined to force Khal Drogo to make him king.|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a navigable river and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{starts as}} Yodit attempts to flee from her nephew Gidajan, who has framed her for theft. She then seeks {{the hand of}} the Syrian prince Zanobis in marriage and performs several deeds to increase her reputation, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the Beja tribes, Nobatia, and the Ikshids. Then she defends the pass of Darginda from the army of Dagnajan, the king of Aksum, and his allies, the Begemder, while also dealing with Alodians and Orthodox monks, killing the king before he makes it through the mountain pass. Following this, she takes the fight to Gidajan and takes control of several stelae in the region surrounding the city of Massawa before taking the city itself. She pursues her nephew to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E

5|$|After their stint on Someone Like Me, Carey and Helford {{developed}} and produced the storyline for The Drew Carey Show. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, {{as he took}} on the stresses of life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey {{was one of four}} actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E

25|$|The cost {{estimate}} also {{raises questions about}} the time-frame of capitalizing the Fund – their estimate took the projected value of fees collected for the Fund (and interest collected on the Fund) weighed against the expected expense of <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with corporate default(s) until 2020.

25|$|The lack {{of design}} {{guidelines}} in X {{has resulted in}} several vastly different interfaces, and in applications that have not always worked well together.

Further standards efforts such as Motif and CDE did not alleviate problems. This has frustrated users and programmers. Graphics programmers now generally address consistency of application look and feel and communication by coding to a specific desktop environment or to a specific widget toolkit, which also avoids <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> directly with the ICCCM.|$|E

25|$|Aside from <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Russian {{political}} interference, Njegoš faced {{several other}} limitations to his power. He had no army, militia or police force {{to enforce the}} rule of law within the territory he nominally controlled and had to rely on warriors from his own clan for protection. The tribes on the Montenegrin frontier often either refused to obey him or befriended his enemies. Tribal raids, which drove deep into Ottoman-held Herzegovina, occurred frequently and looting proved key to the region's economic survival. Though such raids normally elicited a harsh response from the Ottomans, Njegoš was powerless to stop them.|$|E

Liston's connections with the mob were well known and the NAACP was concerned about <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with Liston's visibility as World Champion and had encouraged Patterson not to fight Liston, fearing that a Liston victory would tarnish the civil rights movement.
