30|$|Today the sea <b>freight</b> <b>tariff</b> {{mechanism}} {{is based on}} partial tariff that doesn’t include the external costs arising from CO 2 emission damage, which are a global problem regardless of the source and location the emissions were emitted. In an attempt to find an economic equilibrium that optimally includes all the constraints while taking into consideration the external costs, we selected a market-based approach, based on the motivation that the shipper must pay “the real” cost for the service that he provides (i.e., – sea freight). The use of a market-based method in this study, allows the producer’s (i.e., - owner, vessel operator, etc.) surplus and that the market equilibrium point is economically efficient despite the constraints mentioned before, and eventually to maximize the consumer’s (i.e., - shipper) surplus.|$|E

40|$|In May 1992, the World Bank {{hosted a}} Railway Rountable in Vienna, Austria, {{attended}} by transport ministers, advisors, and senior railway staff from the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The Roundtable reviewed recent {{trends in the}} railways'roles in these countries and identified appropriate actions to address emerging transport issues in the CEE region. The Bank prepared this strategy paper based on the discussions and the apparent widespread consensus that emerged at the Rountable. The financial situation of the CEE railways is beginning to deteriorate rapidly, and the CEE railways are not well positioned to provide good, reliable service to their increasingly market-driven customers. These countries are thus under increasing pressure to restructure their railways to relieve financial pressures and meet future needs. Railways in market economies have faced a steadily declining role in the transport market, and have typically dealt with emerging problems by tinkering at the margin - for example, by debt write-offs - and thus delaying attacking their underlying structural problems. Many of these governments {{have come to the}} conclusion that drastic surgeryis required - as illustrated by the British, German, and Japanese railways. The agenda for change that emerged from this Roundtable emphasized developing a strategic plan for restructuring the railway. This plan should define the market; project the level of activity (tons, ton-kilometers and <b>freight</b> <b>tariffs,</b> passenger-kilometers and passenger fares) for all business activities; include a five-year financial plan for the different lines of railway business (to make options concrete); and define all government policies and changes that would put the railway on a level playing field with competing modes of transportation. One item on the agenda for change is to convert the current railway enterprise operating under normal commercial law. The board of directors should include representatives from government, the railway executive and high-level business or public representatives from outside of government. Formation of JSC or independent enterprise does not necessarily imply privatization of the railway because the underlying assets may well remain in public hands. The objective is to change the enterprises'authority and enhance their commercial orientation. The other item on the agenda for change is to have the explicit mission of the railway be to operate freight and intercity passenger services on a commercial basis, with revenues from services covering all costs, including a return on investment. Social services such as urban passengers, should be identified and supported by the appropriate governmental agencies.

Several new firm-level models of international trade with heterogeneous firms predict that industry productivity will rise as trade costs fall due to the reallocation of activity across plants within an industry.

As medicines move along the supply chain, from the manufacturer to the patient, additional costs {{are added to the}} MSP.

Price components have both a direct and cumulative impact on the price of the medicine.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies one of {{the major}} groups of Russian industrialists, the central cotton manufacturers. In general, the historians 2 ̆ 7 interest {{in the role of the}} state and foreign entrepreneurship in Russian industrialization or their concern with the formation of a Russian bourgeoisie has led them to neglect Russian industrialists. In particular, preoccupation with 1917 has focused attention on those groups who represented the liberal-democratic tradition usually associated with a bourgeoisie at the expense of the non-liberal industrialists. As a result, the existing literature on Russian industrialists has hardly progressed beyond the pre-revolutionary stereotype of that group as politically weak and economically dependent on the government. ^ This study challenges that stereotype. It focuses on three interrelated problems: the entrepreneurial strategies the cotton manufacturers developed to promote the growth of their industry; their interaction with other social groups as they defended their industry against public criticism; and their relationship to the government as revealed in their attempts to influence government policy affecting industry, e. g., <b>tariffs,</b> <b>freight</b> rates, labor legislation, the development of the peripheries and Russia 2 ̆ 7 s role in Asia. ^ This investigation shows that between 1861 and 1914 the central cotton manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 efforts to further the growth of their industry produced a politically outspoken, professionally organized and distinct community in Russian society. The basis of this community was the common ethnic identity, social background, economic interest and regional loyalty of the manufacturers. ^ The changing character of entrepreneurship, social attitudes and political consciousness were closely interwoven in the evolution of this community. The interplay of these variables, also holds the key to understanding the role of Russia 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 commercial-industrial bourgeoisie 2 ̆ 2 as a whole. This study demonstrates that by 1914 Russia 2 ̆ 7 s trade-industrial community had become an economically powerful, politically active and relatively independent social group. But beneath this image were two inherent weaknesses, internal fragmentation and social isolation, caused by the economic, regional and social differences that divided the community and the industrialists 2 ̆ 7 persistent belief that the successful economic development of Russia depended on the partnership between government and industry. These weaknesses proved devastating to the industrialists in 1917. ...|$|R
