5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a fuel gauge, and poor <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable the hydraulic elevator boost and control the elevators manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure on the elevators made the shift to manual <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining <b>elevator</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Civil Aeronautics Board, which concluded its probable cause was {{the loss of a}} 5/16 inch bolt which fell out of the <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> mechanism during the climb from Chicago, resulting in an abrupt pitch up followed by a stall and crash.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} the crash the RAF {{continued}} to fly Hastings aircraft, including from Abingdon. However, {{within a few days}} of the accident the investigation found a fractured bolt in the <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> system (see below) and the Ministry of Defence grounded all 80 operational Hastings. The grounding brought forward the retirement of this type of aircraft, and its replacement with the Lockheed Hercules within a few years of the accident.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> cables be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|E

The apparent cause was a runaway varicam <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> which caused a hammerhead stall {{at very low}} altitude. The aircraft did an overhead loop reversing its direction but crashed into the woods near the take off end of the runway next to the base golf course. There were no survivors.|$|E
25|$|June 20, 1992: The {{pilot of}} a Piper J3C-65 Cub, {{registration}} number N3128M, reported trouble {{and attempted to}} return to Addison Airport soon after taking off to test a newly installed engine. While turning to line up with the runway, the airplane suddenly lost altitude, rolled upside down, and crashed {{in the middle of}} nearby Beltway Drive, killing the pilot and his passenger. The crash was attributed to breakage of the left-hand <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> tube due to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Diminutive, thin-sectioned {{symmetrical}} wing airfoils {{were designed}} for high-speed flight. The <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> circuit was designed by Heston Aircraft Company's Chief Draughtsman, C.G.W Ebbutt, with a variable ratio- with the stick near the neutral position, large movements could be made with small resulting pitch movements. This was needed for accurate handling at low level and high speed (the 3km airspeed record course had to be flown under 100ft above sea level). Towards {{the ends of the}} control column movement, the ratio increased to allow utilization of the full range of elevator travel.|$|E
50|$|The Scout was a factory-built minimum {{aircraft}} that utilised yacht fittings from his local marine shop. The early Scout {{was an extremely}} basic machine, which utilised Dacron sailcloth for the wing covering, lanyards and battens and an aluminium yacht mast as the wing spar. It was initially powered by a modified Victa lawnmower engine and, unlike a conventional aeroplane, had only rudder and <b>elevator</b> <b>controls.</b> Nevertheless, on a good day, it usually flew.|$|R

25|$|Recovering {{from the}} abrupt takeoff, Richmond {{carried out a}} {{preliminary}} test flight with gear extended throughout but after only five minutes airborne, while encountering inadequate <b>elevator</b> <b>control,</b> the engine overheated. According to some accounts, Richmond was being scalded by steam from the radiator mounted below the cockpit, and in haste {{to carry out a}} forced landing, inadvertently stalled the aircraft at approximately 30ft above the airfield. Other sources state that the coolant leak only occurred after impact. The aircraft impacted heavily, with the undercarriage driven through the wings, and the tail broken off. Richmond survived with minor injuries, chiefly burns.|$|E
25|$|By early 1968, the Army and Bell {{were working}} {{together}} again {{to expand the}} envelope of the Model 533. Bell removed the wings previously used {{and replaced them with}} a stub wing mounted higher and further back on the airframe. Bell also replaced the J69 turbojets with Pratt & Whitney JT12A-3 (J60) engines, capable of producing 3,300pounds (13.3kN) of thrust each, mounting the new engines on the ends of the stub wings. Bell also modified the helicopter flight controls to change pitch control from inputs to the rotor during lower flight speeds to airplane-style <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> during high-speed flight. On 15 April 1969, the Model 533 achieved its highest speed of 274.6knots (316.0mph, 508.6km/h).|$|E
25|$|The {{report was}} {{published}} on 20 September 2005. It fully supported {{the findings of}} all three previous reports and found no evidence for an impact with a Harrier or any other aircraft. The conclusion was founded firstly in a full review of all logs and documentation and a full review of all technical analysis in the first reports. It concluded that all witnesses of fighter aircraft had made statements many years after the accident {{and that there was}} a high degree of uncertainty as to the time of their observations. Only the statement of Grete Mortensen could not be rejected, but the commission could not find that it showed any conclusive evidence either. The commission also found beyond doubt that no Harriers were airborne {{at the time of the}} accident. The commission also rejected that the captain's health had an influence on the crash and found that similar <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> faults had occurred on other crashed Twin Otters.|$|E

50|$|Aviation {{experts in}} Russia pointed out {{multiple}} similarities between Flight 981 and Tatarstan Airlines Flight 363.

The Flight 363 investigation, conducted by the Interstate Aviation Committee, ruled that the 2013 accident {{was the result of}} pilot error; one dissenting commission member, a Rosaviatsiya representative, filed an alternative opinion report, claiming the commission ignored a possible mechanical malfunction of the Boeing 737's <b>elevator</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the Polish investigatory commission, {{the cause}} of the crash was the {{disintegration}} of an engine shaft due to faulty bearings inside the number 2 engine which seized, causing extensive heat. This in turn caused the consequent damage to engine number 1 (and its fire), rapid decompression of the hull, a fire in the cargo hold (which was not detected due to a damaged fire alarm system sensor), as well as the loss of <b>elevator</b> <b>controls</b> and progressive electrical failure.|$|R
25|$|As {{the crash}} {{occurred}} in international waters, {{the responsibility for}} investigating the incident fell to the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA) per International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13. As the ECAA lacked {{the resources of the}} much larger American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Egyptian government asked the NTSB to handle the investigation. Two weeks after the crash, the NTSB proposed handing the investigation over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as the evidence suggested that a criminal act had taken place and that the crash was intentional rather than accidental. This proposal was unacceptable to the Egyptian authorities, and hence the NTSB continued to lead the investigation. As the evidence of a deliberate crash mounted, the Egyptian government reversed its earlier decision and the ECAA launched its own investigation. The two investigations came to very different conclusions: the NTSB concluded that the relief first officer Gameel Al-Batouti deliberately crashed the plane, while the ECAA determined that the incident was caused by mechanical failure of the aircraft's <b>elevator</b> <b>control</b> system.|$|E
