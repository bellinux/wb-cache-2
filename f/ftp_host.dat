40|$|Abstract—Identifying {{application}} {{types in}} network traffic {{is a difficult}} problem for administrators who must secure and manage network resources, further complicated {{by the use of}} encrypted protocols and nonstandard port numbers. This paper takes a unique approach to this problem by modeling and analyzing application graphs, structures which describe the application-level (e. g., HTTP, <b>FTP)</b> communications between <b>hosts.</b> These graphs are searched for motifs: recurring, significant patterns of interconnections {{that can be used to}} help determine the network application in use. Motif-based analysis has been applied pre-dominantly to biological networks to hypothesize key functional regulatory units, but never to network traffic as it is here. For the proposed method, a description of each node is generated based on its participation in statistically significant motifs. These descriptions, or profiles, are data points in multidimensional space that are used as input to a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier to predict the application. This work also compares the performance of motif-based analysis to an alternative profile type based on “traditional ” graph measures such as path lengths, clustering coefficients and centrality measures. The results show that motif profiles perform better than traditional profiles, and are able to correctly identify the actions of 85 % of the hosts examined across seven protocols. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{additive}} increase/multiplicative de-crease probing {{paradigm is}} at the core of TCP con-gestion control and allows TCP flows to regulate the transmission rate in order to match the network ca-pacity. To improve classic Reno/New Reno congestion control algorithms, the recent Westwood+ TCP pro-poses to substitute the multiplicative decrease phase with an adaptive decrease phase: in particular, West-wood+ TCP passes through a filter the stream of re-turning ACKs to obtain an estimate of the used band-width (BWE), so that when a congestion episode hap-pens, Westwood+ adaptively reduces the congestion window and the slow-start threshold to the value BWE times the minimum round trip time. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of Westwood+ TCP over the real Internet. To this pur-pose, a Linux 2. 4. 19 implementation of Westwood+ TCP has been developed and compared with an im-plementation of New Reno. To test and compare the two implementations more than 4000 files, with differ-ent sizes, have been uploaded via <b>ftp</b> from a <b>host</b> at the Politecnico of Bari (South of Italy) to three remote servers, which are located at Parma (North of Italy), Uppsala University (Sweden) and University of Cal-ifornia Los Angeles (Ucla, California). Experimental results indicate that Westwood+ TCP improves the goodput with respect to New Reno TCP over paths ∗This work has been partially supported by the FIRB Re-search Project ”Traffic models and Algorithms for Next Gen-eration IP networks Optimization (TANGO) ” with a bandwidth delay product larger than few seg-ments. In particular, goopdput improvements up to 40 - 50 % have been measured when transmitting data from Politecnico of Bari to Uppsala or UCLA servers. ...|$|R
40|$|IPv 6 Privacy extensions, {{implemented}} in major operating systems, hide user’s identity {{by using a}} temporary and a randomly generated IPv 6 addresses rather than using the former, EUI- 64 format where the MAC address {{is part of the}} IPv 6 address. This solution for privacy has created a problem for network administrators to back-trace an IPv 6 address to a specific MAC address, since the temporary IP address used once by the node is removed from the interface after a period of time. An IPv 6 Ethernet test bed is setup to investigate IPv 6 implementation dynamics in Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10. 04 operating systems. The testbed is extended to investigate the effects of temporary IPv 6 addresses due to IPv 6 privacy extensions on the on-going sessions of different applications including ping, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and video streaming (HTTP and RTP). On the basis of the knowledge obtained from investigations about dynamics of IPv 6 privacy extensions, this work proposes Internet Protocol version 6 Host Tracking (IPv 6 HoT), a web based IPv 6 to MAC mapping solution. IPv 6 HoT uses Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to forward IPv 6 Neighbor table from routers to Network Management Stations (NMS). This thesis work provides guidelines for configuring IPv 6 privacy extensions in Ubuntu 10. 04 and Windows 7; the difference of implementation between these two operating systems is also presented in this work. The results show that temporary IPv 6 addressing has a definite effect on the on-going sessions of video streaming and FTP applications. Applications running as server on Temporary IPv 6 address encountered more frequent on-going session interruptions than applications running as a server over public IPv 6 address. When temporary IPv 6 addresses were configured to <b>host</b> <b>FTP</b> and video streaming applications, their on-going sessions were permanently interrupted. It is also observed that LFTP, a client FTP application, resumes an interrupted session. theodrosmek 11 @gmail. com, iamvivek 86 @gmail. co...|$|R
