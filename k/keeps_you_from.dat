She felt the show was [...] "taut and terrifically calibrated" [...] noting it has [...] "at least one deadly effective twist you won't see coming". The San Francisco Chronicle praised the series, calling it a winner and wrote: [...] "The plot is intricate and compelling, the characters magnetic and mysterious at the same time." [...] James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote about Chopra's performance, describing her as the [...] "strongest human asset" [...] of the show, and added that [...] "she is immediately charismatic and commanding". He added that [...] "the narrative gymnastics make the first half-hour of Quantico pass quickly and entertainingly. Too much of this, though, <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> investing much in the characters." [...] Robert Bianco from USA Today gave it a three out of four, praising the diversity of the cast and Chopra's and Ellis performances, writing [...] "There are times when Quantico feels a shade mechanical, in moments when you can practically hear the plot gears moving. But it accomplishes what the opener of a whodunit needs to do: establish a wide range of plausible suspects and spark our interest in the mystery and the hero." [...] In contrast, TheWraps Tim Grierson, who although felt that the show [...] "provides sexy fun", was less impressed, writing that the show often succumbed to [...] "lame-brained plotting" [...] and a unconvincing portrayal of the setting. He concluded saying that the fluffy material did not fit well with the darker tones [...] "meant to be struck by the introduction of a cataclysmic terrorist attack." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The air inside," [...] said Jonas. [...] "We {{have stopped}} {{up all the}} places, where it could get out. The valve stops itself.

"You were away," [...] {{continued}} Everingham, {{eager to}} goad his friend into speech, [...] "and my Lord Cardinal and Don Miguel {{know how to}} blow upon the flames of Mary's jealousy.

6000|$|... "Of course I see that--that your {{engagement}} at {{your own}} variety-show, with its interminable 'turns,' <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> going to the others.

6000|$|... "The {{labourer}} with twelve shillings a {{week has}} no such fear. And if he did marry, the food would come. It isn't that. The man is unconscientious and ignorant as to the sources of true happiness, and won't submit himself to cold mutton and three clean shirts a week,--not because he dislikes mutton and dirty linen himself,--but because the world says they are vulgar.

60|$|I am not of {{the opinion}} of those gentlemen who are against {{disturbing}} the public repose: I like a clamor, whenever there is an abuse. The fire-bell at midnight disturbs your sleep, but it <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> being burned in your bed. The hue-and-cry alarms the county, but it preserves all {{the property of the}} province. All these clamors aim at redress. But a clamor made merely for the purpose of rendering the people discontented with their situation, without an endeavor to give them a practical remedy, is indeed one of the worst acts of sedition.|$|E
6000|$|He {{paused and}} then became eloquent. [...] "The world is against us, against--us. To you it offers money to cheat--to be ignoble. For it is ignoble! It offers you no honest way, only a miserable drudgery. And it <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> me. And me too it bribes {{with the promise of}} success--if I will desert you ... You don't know all ... We may have to wait for years--we may have to wait for ever, if we wait until life is safe. We may be separated.... We may lose one another altogether.... Let us fight against it. Why should we separate? Unless True Love is like the other things--an empty cant. This is the only way. We two--who belong to one another." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped to}} get his breath and then resumed: [...] "You won't find the lode, and you'll come back feeling sick and sore. If they keep you on at the school, you won't want to teach; you'll think of nothing but saving all you can and pulling out again. You're like father, and {{when he took the}} lone trail the blamed foolishness got such a grip of him that he never broke loose. Well, you'll lose your job and the next you get; in fact, you'll come to hate any work that <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> the North. But a girl can't let herself down until she turns into a hobo. It's frankly unthinkable. Pull up and cut out the crazy program before it ruins you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, my dear master!" [...] I said. [...] "God <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> {{harm and}} wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past {{kindness}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the bondage I hated {{for myself}} I wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from.</b> What better could the most loving mother have done? I {{relieved}} <b>you</b> <b>from</b> {{the bondage of}} having been born a Jew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't worry {{yourself}} any more, Mr. Morris," [...] interrupted Miss Port. [...] "I'm not askin' {{you to take}} me now, and I won't <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> your dinner." ...|$|R
