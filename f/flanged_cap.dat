50|$|There {{are several}} types of fast-opening doors {{commonly}} used. The simplest and most primitive type of door, a bolted plate or <b>flanged</b> <b>cap</b> {{on some sort of}} hinge, is no longer considered even minimally acceptable for production autoclaves because it is anything but quick in opening and closing. For vessels up to four feet in diameter and rated at not much over 125 psi, a hinged semi-elliptical door secured by lever-operated cam-locking T-bolts works essentially as quickly and as easily as the more commonly used rotating locking ring door. This door design uses up to a dozen or so latching T-bolts on the door hub (see photos), the stationary part fitted to the cylindrical vessel itself, which engage matching lugs welded to the door. When the operating levers are rotated over center, the T-bolts draw the lugs closer and seal the door by means of an O-ring gasket.|$|E
40|$|A report {{describes}} an improved high-voltage isolator for preventing electrical discharge along the flow {{path of a}} propellant gas being fed from a supply at a spacecraft chassis electrical potential to an ion thruster at a potential as high as multiple kilovolts. The isolator must survive launch vibration and must remain electrically nonconductive for thousands of hours under conditions that, {{in the absence of}} proper design, would cause formation of electrically conductive sputtered metal, carbon, and/or decomposed hydrocarbons on its surfaces. The isolator includes an alumina cylinder containing a spiral channel filled with a porous medium made from alumina microbeads fired together with an alumina slurry. Connections to gas-transport tubes are made {{at both ends of the}} alumina cylinder by means of metal caps containing fine-mesh screens to prevent passage of loose alumina particles. The outer surface of the alumina cylinder is convoluted to lengthen the electrical path between the metal caps and to afford shadow shielding to minimize the probability of formation of a continuous deposit that would electrically connect the ends. A <b>flanged</b> cylindrical metal <b>cap</b> that surrounds the alumina cylinder without touching one of the ends provides additional shadow shielding...|$|R
