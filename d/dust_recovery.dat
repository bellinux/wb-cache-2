In this article the author outlines some of the principal features of this process, and describes in some detail the chemical reaction taking place at the platinum surface. He also discusses the changes {{that occur in the}} gauze leading to metal loss during operation. Handling and repairing the gauzes on a plant site and platinum <b>dust</b> <b>recovery</b> byJilters are among other aspects of interest to plant operators with which the author deals. Thomas Malthus (1766 - 1 834) maintained that the world’s population increases more rapidly than its food supplies, and only disease, war, poverty and vice prevent large-scale starvation. He could not foresee the world of the twentieth century, nor the role to be played by platinum gauzes in producing fixed nitrogen fertilisers without which his gloomy predictions might well be realised. I t is now estimated that the total world output of nitric acid has risen from about 18. 3 million tonnes (100 per cent HNO,) in 1962 - 63 to just under 23. 5 million tonnes in 1965 - 66 (I). At this level of production the world’s nitric acid plants are believed to operate at an average of 82 per cent of all available production capacity. The estimated production of the major manufacturing countries is shown in Table I (I). It may also be estimated that this total plant capacity represents a platinum gauze inventory o...|$|E

40|$|The Egyptian Iron and Steel Company {{generates a}} great amount of blast furnace flue <b>dust.</b> The <b>recovery</b> of metals and carbon from this flue dust becomes a very {{important}} demand due to the increase of the price of coke breeze and the decrease of the primary source of metals. At the same time, it make the environment more safe by decreasing pollution. Introducing these dust fines in the sintering process proves to be very harmful for different operating parameters. Thus, this study aims at investigating the production of pellets resulting from these fines, using molasses as organic binder and its application in sintering of iron ore. The sintering experiments were performed using flue dust as pellets as a substitute of coke breeze. The results revealed that, sintering properties such as inter strength increases with using the flue dust pellets, while productivity of both the sinter machine and sinter machine at blast furnace yard decreases. Also the vertical velocity of the sinter machine and the weight loss during the reduction of produced the sinter by hydrogen decrease...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the physical and chemical characteristics of a flue dust sample from a coal fired reverberatory furnace was carried out. The characterization studies revealed that cuprous ferrite, delafossite, {{is one of the}} major copper bearing constituents in flue dusts collected from copper reverberatory furnaces. A knowledge of the leaching characteristics of delafossite is thus essential to the development of hydrometallurgical techniques for copper <b>recovery</b> from flue <b>dusts.</b> The <b>recovery</b> of copper from synthetic delafossite was investigated using an ammoniacal carbonate solution. The results obtained indicate that the dissolution of delafossite in ammoniacal solution is very slow, but can be dramatically improved by a reductive roast prior to leaching. The kinetics of dissolution of delafossite has been found to strongly depend on the extent of reduction, particle size and stirring speed. It has also been found that applied oxygen pressure increases the rate of dissolution and accentuates the particle size effect. The experimental data seem to fit a film diffusion model. Limited studies have been carried out on the recovery of copper from a flue dust collected from a coal fired reverberatory furnace. Results from these studies have been compared with those obtained for synthetic delafossite...|$|R

However, zinc contamination of the dust restricts how much can be recovered through the process. An inline sampling system was used to isokinetically sample primary BOS dust from the slurry pipe of a 248 m 3 capacity BOS converter at Tata Steelworks Port Talbot (UK). The process was benchmarked with low galvanised scrap trials and control trials before investigating a new inprocess zinc separation technique. This trial involved holding galvanised scrap in a hot converter purged with nitrogen, to volatilise the zinc from the primary dust system for capture in the secondary dust system, before the blow. Using this technique, the zinc contamination of the primary BOS dust was reduced by up to 52...|$|R

40|$|The waste-heat boiler is used {{within the}} Sulphide flash {{smelting}} process {{as the main}} <b>dust</b> and energy <b>recovery</b> unit. The large volume of off-gas discharged from the flash smelter is {{at a very high}} temperature (1350 °C) and contains a significant dust load that subjects the downstream waste-heat boiler to tough and demanding conditions. The boiler cavity is especially prone to dust accretions, fouling, and corrosion caused by accumulation of molten particles and precipitation of sulphuric acid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied within a qualitative study to model the flow and heat transfer distribution throughout the waste-heat boiler. The commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 2. 16, was applied to a modified waste-heat boiler (23 m × 11 m × 5. 4 m) within the Outokumpu flash smelting process. This investigation focuses on the geometric modifications to the typical boiler design, which includes elevation of the ceiling, placement of flow-obstructing baffles and radiation plates parallel within the flow path. Also investigated were various boiler operating conditions such as the circulation of process off-gas, air leakage from the dust discharging hoppers and variation in inlet gas composition. The geometric modifications had the desired effect of increasing the volumetric utilization and therefore enhancing heat transfer between the boiler surface and the gas stream and dust segregation. Introducing circulated off-gas at a rate of 20 m/s and at a 45 ° angle {{to the front of the}} waste boiler further enhanced cooling while reducing the high impact of the furnace-uptake gas-stream on the boiler ceiling. The placement of radiation plates was found to be very effective in enhancing the heat transfer surface and distributing gas flow within the boiler. These results present recommendations towards an improved waste-heat boiler design. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2007. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} lignin in a Kraft pulp mill, {{with the aim}} to utilize the lignin as more value added green product than just firing lignin in black liquor, is {{possible}} with a LignoBoost plant. The LignoBoost plant uses sulfuric acid {{in the process and}} this results in an increased net input of sulfur to the pulp mills recovery cycle. The sodium/sulfur balance in a Kraft pulp mill is an important factor to be able to run a mill optimal. The increased input of sulfur into the mill when implementing a LignoBoost plant is therefore an issue to address. A too high sulfur/sodium ratio in the Kraft pulp mill is often solved by purging electrostatic precipitator <b>dust</b> from the <b>recovery</b> boiler. The major component of the ESP dust is sodium sulfate. When purging ESP <b>dust</b> from the <b>recovery</b> boiler the mill loose sodium and the need of sodium make-up increases. A large extent of the ESP dust that is not purged is returned to the recovery cycle of the mill via the evaporation plant. If the recycled sodium sulfate could be split and returned to the recovery cycle as one controlled sodium- and one controlled sulfur component or at least split into two flows where sulfur is enriched in one flow and sodium in the other flow, the sodium/sulfur balance would be easier controlled. In this master thesis the split of sodium and sulfur in sodium sulfate is addressed. The aim is to study opportunities to: • Enrich sodium and sulfur in two flows from the dissolved ESP dust, which is normally recycled to the evaporation plant. • Produce one sulfur component and one sodium component that can be utilized in the Kraft pulp mill, especially in an integrated LignoBoost process. • Accomplish this by using an electrochemical split of the sodium sulfate from the ESP dust to generate sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid.   To be able to produce one sulfur component and one sodium component from the dissolved ESP dust an electrodialysis with or without bipolar membranes is the method to use decided after contact with Eka Chemicals research and development department and literature studies. An electrodialysis cell produces sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, from the sodium sulfate solution, {{that can be used in}} the Kraft pulp mill. The difficulty by using an electrochemical cell with ion selective membranes is the need of a pure feed to the cell. If a high content of contaminations, such as multivalent ions, is present in the feed solution to the cell scaling can be formed. Scaling leads to shorter membrane life that result in higher operational cost for the cell stack. Due to the multivalent ions in the electrostatic dust a pre-treatment such as carbonate- and hydroxide precipitation removal of the ions is suggested, which results in a decrease of the multivalent ions in the feed solution.   In previous work concerning electrochemical split of sodium sulfate the lack of utilization for the produced acid became negative in an economical point of view. The need of sulfuric acid to the LignoBoost plant is an advantage for the economical study. In this master thesis is:   • An economical case study for the implementation of an electrochemical cell, electrodialysis with or without a bipolar membrane, in a Kraft pulp mill performed. • A sensitivity analysis performed and evaluated in the aim of addressing the change in payback time due to alternating: Sodium price Membrane life Utilization of the acid produced from the electrochemical cell. The economical case study concerns a Kraft pulp mill with a LignoBoost plant. Utilization of the acid to the LignoBoost- and tall oil plant is varied, as is the membrane life for the cell stack. The membrane life is varied due to the difficulty of predicting the ESP-feed solutions affect on the membranes. The feed solution has to be tested in a cell to decide the real life for the membrane in this case.   The electrodialysis cell with bipolar membranes indicates promising economical gain for future implementation in a mill with LignoBoost lignin removal compared to the electrodialysis cell that indicates no economical gain for future implementation in a mill. For a mill with both a LignoBoost plant and a tall oil plant, i. e. optimized utilization of acid from the electrodialysis with bipolar membrane, and a five years membrane life in the cell, a payback of one and a half year can be reached. The same case but for an electrodialysis results in nine and a half payback years. The sensitivity analysis show that compared to the electrodialysis with bipolar membrane, the electrodialysis cell is more vulnerable to changes for the acid utilization, sodium hydroxide price and membrane life. The BME cell is most affected by changes in the sodium hydroxide price and the ED cell affects most by changes in the membrane life...|$|R
