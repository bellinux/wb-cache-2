40|$|As the 50 th {{anniversary of}} the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) draws near, the author was {{surprised}} to learn that the published latitude and longitude for CTIO in the Astronomical Almanac and iraf observatory database appears to differ from modern GPS-measured <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> by nearly a kilometer. Surely, the position for CTIO could not be in error after five decades? The source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~ 30 " difference between the astronomical and <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> [...] a systematic effect due to vertical deflection first reported by Harrington, Mintz Blanco, & Blanco (1972). Since the astronomical position is not necessarily the desired quantity for some calculations, and since the number of facilities on Cerro Tololo and neighboring Cerro Pachon has grown considerably over the years, I decided to measure accurate <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> for all of the observatories and some select landmarks on the two peaks using GPS and Google Earth. Both sets of measurements were inter-compared, and externally compared to a high accuracy geodetic position for a NASA Space Geodesy Program survey monument on Tololo. I conclude that Google Earth can currently be used to determine absolute <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> (i. e. compared to GPS) accurate to roughly +- 0. 15 " (+- 5 m) in latitude and longitude without correction, or approximately +- 0 ". 10 (+- 3 m) with correction. I tabulate final geodetic and geocentric positions on the WGS- 84 coordinate system for all astronomical observatories on Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon with accuracy +- 0 ". 1 (+- 3 m).

40|$|Periodic {{horizontal}} signals {{have been}} identified in sub-daily estimates of position obtained from GPS data using batch least-squares solutions. The estimation of sub-daily position is commonly used for ocean loading and ice movement studies, for example. These spurious motions are artefacts of the processing methodology due to the presence of unmodelled, tidally-induced vertical signals in the GPS data. The periodic horizontal signals have magnitudes of about 40 – 50 % of the amplitude of the vertical periodic signal. The shape of the periodic horizontal signals is related to the first derivative and the square of the vertical signal. The artefacts are mostly evident in the east–west component and can be removed by fixing the carrier phase ambiguities to integer values. We introduce a sensitivity analysis to study in detail the effects of ambiguity resolution and latitudinal variation of the artefacts. The overall conclusions are that for high precision batch processing of time series of <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions,</b> using sub-daily data spans, care needs to be taken to avoid aliasing of horizontal coordinates due to the vertical motion of the site...|$|E

Since {{subsidence}} {{is often}} accompanied by horizontal earth movements, an area undergoing vertical surveillance can be checked for such horizontal movement by triangulation ff prior <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> are known within the region. Triangulation station Baldwin Aux., whose position {{was determined by the}} 1934 Cooperative Control Survey of the metropolitan Los Angeles area, and which falls within a known area of subsidence, was reobserved. By using as control some of the other original 1933 stations which were external to the subsidence area, the adjustment resulting from observations on these points showed a horizontal movement of greater than 2 feet in 27 years. From secondary triangulation emanating from the 1961 position of Baldwin Aux., the horizontal movement of other previously positioned points was deter-mined, and resulting movement vectors were computed.

40|$|Strong {{seasonal}} variations of {{horizontal and vertical}} positions are observed on GPS time series from stations located in Nepal, India, and Tibet (China). We show that this geodetic deformation {{can be explained by}} {{seasonal variations}} of continental water storage driven by the monsoon. For this purpose, we use satellite data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment to determine the time evolution of surface loading. We compute the expected geodetic deformation assuming a perfectly elastic Earth model. We consider Green's functions, describing the surface deformation response to a point load, for an elastic homogeneous half-space model and for a layered nonrotating spherical Earth model based on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model and a local seismic velocity model. The amplitude and phase of the seasonal variation of the vertical and horizontal <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> can be jointly adjusted only with the layered Earth model, while an elastic half-space model fails, emphasizing the importance of using a realistic Earth elastic structure to model surface displacements induced by surface loading. We demonstrate, based on a formal inversion, that the fit to the geodetic data can be improved by adjusting the layered Earth model. Therefore, the study also shows that the modeling of geodetic seasonal variations provides a way to probe the elastic structure of the Earth, {{even in the absence of}} direct measurements of surface load variations...|$|E
30|$|Since autumn 1993 the BIFROST {{project has}} {{provided}} daily GPS solutions of <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions</b> from {{a network of}} more than 40 stations covering a large area of the Baltic shield. This area is expected to show large vertical motion due to glacial isostatic rebound following the deglaciation {{at the end of}} the Pleistocene. This paper will discuss the inference of three-dimensional rates of crustal motion at the GPS stations with respect to (1) a plate-fixed average for the horizontal components; (2) a geocentric reference in order to infer absolute changes of sea level from vertical crustal motion and models of geoidal rebound. We show that the horizontal strain rate pattern is largely dominated by unilateral extension and not exhibiting horizontal shear to an important extent. In regard to the vertical motion a crucial issue is the stability of the geocentre in the GPS frame. We show results from an Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis that attenuates regionally correlated noise. In all components our observations suggest reasonably close agreement with forward computions on the basis of postglacial isostatic adjustment. A dominant tectonic signal would lead to a certain fraction of the batch of baselines to exhibit shortening. A tectonic process leading to a similar pattern of horizontal motion as expected from postglacial rebound can safely be dismissed in the context of the currently accepted plate tectonic setting. Thus, our baseline rate comparison will be a critical first order test of the prevailing style of deformation.|$|E
40|$|The {{necessities of}} the {{contemporary}} world require agility and precision {{with respect to the}} <b>geodetic</b> <b>positions.</b> Spatial positioning technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems have been applied in the fields that require reliable spatial information. Thus, there are many brands of receivers and GNSS data processing programs on the market. Considering this, it was verified the need for standardization of the data collected by GNSS receivers to be processed by any software. Therefore, the Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) was designed. This study aimed to investigate whether there are significant discrepancies in the estimation of horizontal and vertical components of the stations, with the use of files in raw and RINEX format. Accordingly, the screening of the local GNSS network stations of the Universidade Federal de Uberlandia was performed using single frequency (L 1) Global Positioning System receivers (GPS), applying the relative positioning static method. Thereafter, the processing and the adjustment of GPS data were performed in raw and RINEX. The precision between the solutions achieved was analyzed under the proposed methodology as well as the discrepancies between the estimated coordinates of the stations in terms of their local coordinates. The results concluded that there arent significant differences in the use of these files. However, it is recommended to analyze a longer period of data, different stations in different screening conditions, and to use different applications for converting raw files to RINEX files, and processing software of GNSS data. Thereafter there will be more parameters to make more judicious analyzes. Pages: 5132 - 513...|$|E
40|$|Precise Point Positioning (PPP) can be {{used for}} a wide range of {{applications}} in <b>geodetic</b> <b>positioning.</b> Providing precise clock and orbit information, a single station can be positioned in a reference frame. This leads to a very efficient processing procedure since the normal equation system is very small compared to network processing. PPP achieves very robust solutions comparable to network solutions. A drawback of PPP is that it does not respect the principle of adjacent points, because correlations between neighbouring stations are not considered. This drawback leads to a disadvantageous stochastic behaviour between adjacent stations. However, as the point positions are computed using identical orbit and clock information, correlations between the estimated coordinates still remain. The presentation focus on this fact and determines correlations between station coordinates.
