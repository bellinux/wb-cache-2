5|$|The {{role of the}} <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effect</b> in most bike designs is to help {{steer the}} front wheel into the {{direction}} of a lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effect</b> of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effect</b> all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
40|$|For {{flywheel}} rotors {{or other}} rotors with significant ratios of moments of inertia, {{the influence of}} <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects</b> has to be considered. While conservative or damped systems remain stable even under <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects,</b> magnetically suspended rotors can be destabilized with increasing rotational speed. The influence of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects</b> on the stability and behavior of a magnetic bearing system is analyzed. The analysis is carried out with a rigid body model for the rotor and a nonlinear model for the magnetic bearing and its amplifier. Cross feedback control can compensate <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects.</b> This compensation leads to better system performance and can avoid instability. Furthermore, the implementation of this compensation is simple. The main structure of a decentralized controller can still be used. It has only to be expanded by the cross feedback path...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike the {{preceding}} Pup and Triplane, the Camel {{was considered to}} be difficult to fly. The type owed both its extreme manoeuvrability and its difficult handling to the close placement of the engine, pilot, guns and fuel tank (some 90% of the aircraft's weight) within the front seven feet of the aircraft, and to the strong <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effect</b> of the rotating mass of the cylinders common to rotary engines. Aviation author Robert Jackson notes that: [...] "in the hands of a novice it displayed vicious characteristics that could make it a killer; but under the firm touch of a skilled pilot, who knew how to turn its vices to his own advantage, {{it was one of the}} most superb fighting machines ever built".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect of}} ball {{imbalance}} (either static or dynamic) {{is the ability}} to introduce gyroscopic effects on the rotation. The component of imbalance along the rotation axis provides a leverage that can change the orientation of the axis on its horizontal plane, an action physicists call precession. It is basically the same thing as a spinning toy top [...] "going around in a circle." [...] In the case of a rotating bowling ball, as it moves along the lane, there is only time for its total rotation axis to move along a short arc, but this is enough to reorient the total rotation so that some of the forward-roll becomes side-roll, increasing the side-roll provided in the bowler's delivery, thereby achieving more hook. It is possible to use dynamic ball balancing to achieve a stronger <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effect</b> than static balancing alone.|$|E

40|$|This paper emphasises {{that the}} <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects</b> {{represented}} by the Eulerian Junction Structure in the rotational domain of a rigid body, are due to centrifugal phenomena, resulting from the non-inertiality of the coordinate frame in which the angular velocity is expressed.

40|$|We analyse the {{classical}} {{problem of the}} stability of bicycles when moving quickly and upright. Developing a lean causes the front wheel to turn thereby setting the bicycle instantaneously into circular motion. The centripetal force associated with the lean-dependent turning circle gives a restoring torque which corrects the lean. The force also helps self-steer the front wheel, ensuring the bicycle continues in an essentially straight path. We give the frequency of lean oscillations about the vertical executed during riding. As in the literature, we discuss the neglect of <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects,</b> which experiment suggests are negligible.

40|$|Abstract. High-speed milling (HSM) {{which is}} {{characterized}} as high productivity and {{low power consumption}} can be widely used in the manufacture industry. However, while the speed of spindle-tool reach the high speed range, the prediction of its stable milling faces more difficulties, as the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects</b> become prominent. In this paper, a dynamics model of HSM system was set up considering the influence of gyroscopic moment due to high rotating speed of spindle-tool. Then a method was proposed by transforming time-varying stiffness system into fixed-step time invariant one. Finally the stability lobes diagrams (SLD) was elaborated. The results shows that the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>effects</b> due to high rotating speed have non-negligible impact on the stability limitation, which must be considered for the predicting of stability limit in the high speed milling...|$|R
