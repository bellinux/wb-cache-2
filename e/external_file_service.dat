Among Classroom's strengths, the review highlighted ease of use, universal device accessibility, use of Google Drive as an effective way for teachers to quickly share assignments with students, the paperless process meaning the end of printing, handing out, and potentially losing work, and the fast feedback system between students and teachers. Among Classroom's disadvantages, the review highlighted the service's heavy integration of Google apps and services with limited or no support for <b>external</b> <b>files</b> or <b>services,</b> lack of automated quizzes and tests, {{and a lack of}} discussion forums or live chats that can aid in feedback efforts.|$|R

When saving an outline Leo automatically writes all changed @file trees back to the <b>external</b> <b>files.</b> Comments, called sentinel lines, in <b>external</b> <b>files</b> represent the outline structure. When Leo reads an outline, these comments allow Leo to recreate @file trees using only the data in the <b>external</b> <b>file.</b> @auto nodes represent <b>external</b> <b>files</b> without using sentinel comments. When reading @auto nodes, Leo uses the program structure of the <b>external</b> <b>file</b> to create the @auto tree.|$|R

The second part of this work identifies significant changes in legislation, which influence individual activities of <b>filing</b> <b>service.</b> This enumeration serves as a basis for change proposals leading to the removal of flaws in processes as well as confusion in <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> managment in the municipal office.

The theoretical part is focused on definition of the basic terms and contains a description of the document lifecycle. An {{important part of the}} <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> is the creation of the file which is governed by the applicable legislation. Life cycle of documents and files is ending within the shredding proces. The individual steps are described in the thesis. The practical part is focused on achieving of the targets in this thesis. It {{deals with the}} <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> of a specific public originator which is the Municipality of Kamenice nad Lipou. There is described the evolution <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> in the municipal office, the implementation of an electronic <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> system and start of data boxes operations. The goal of the thesis is valorize the benefits of the introduction of electronic <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> and if public originators can achieve savings due to this information technologies. There will be evaluated positives and negatives of both analog and electronic form <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> and whether all public originators are able to practice <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> by applicable laws...|$|R

We identify and support twelve workload-description parameters, enabling a wide range of workloads to evaluate <b>file</b> <b>service</b> scalability, sizing, configuration, and other factors. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by using these parameters to express seven popular existing workloads that exercise different aspects of a <b>file</b> <b>service.</b> As workload patterns continue to evolve, it is straightforward to capture and emulate their essential characteristics. ...|$|R

50|$|In September 2015, {{security}} researcher Patrick Wardle {{wrote about}} another shortcoming that concerns applications that are distributed with <b>external</b> <b>files,</b> such as libraries or even HTML files that can contain JavaScript. An attacker can manipulate those files and through them exploit a vulnerability in the signed application. The application and its <b>external</b> <b>files</b> {{can then be}} redistributed, while leaving the original signature of the application bundle itself intact. As Gatekeeper does not verify such individual files, the security can be compromised. With path randomization and signed disk images, Apple provided mechanisms to mitigate this issue in macOS Sierra.|$|R

This allows developers to guarantee the integrity of <b>external</b> <b>files</b> that are distributed alongside the application bundle on the same disk image. An attacker could infect these <b>external</b> <b>files</b> with malicious code and with them exploit a vulnerability in the application, without having to break the signature of the application bundle itself. By signing the disk image, the developer can prevent tampering and force an attacker to repackage the files onto a new disk image, requiring a valid developer certificate to pass Gatekeeper without a warning.|$|R
