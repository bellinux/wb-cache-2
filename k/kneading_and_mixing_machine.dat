Troller's caption: Bakers, <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>machine</b> (H- 5) Estate of the artist, Doris RauchBorn in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller {{served as a}} soldier in World War I, {{spending}} time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{rheological}} properties of different processing parameters (pH, storage temperature, moisture content and gelation temperature) of surimi obtained from Blue Whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) was studied. Surimi paste was obtained in the laboratory from fresh Blue Whiting and samples were taken at the different phases of the surimi paste elaboration process. Results showed that Blue Whiting surimi has a yield, appearance and yield point value {{similar to that of}} typical cod or pollock surimi. Also, the paste should be frozen in the first 24 h after cutting, <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> to avoid an excessive decrease in elasticity. In addition, pH values higher than 7 could give derivates that are too deformable, values of about 6. 7 being recommended for the paste. Likewise, the study of the gelling temperature showed values for the first temperature (“setting”) lower than the cod and pollock surimi setting temperature, and so it is recommended that the second heating temperature for Blue Whiting paste be lower...|$|R

The development of fish scraps shredding <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>machine</b> {{can be of}} great help {{to the production of}} fish emulsion fertilizer in both quality and quantity. The study specifically covered the design, development and performance evaluation of the fish scraps shredding <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>machine</b> that was employed for fish emulsion fertilizer production. Preliminary tests were performed to establish operating conditions of the machine such as working capacity, shredding speed, mixing speed, <b>mixing</b> time <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> capacity. The working capacity was found to be 750 g of fish scraps. The shredding speed established was based on the variable frequency drive (VFD) at 50 Hz which corresponds to 1800 rpm. The actual performance of the machine was evaluated by determining the shredding rate and efficiency. Based from the results gathered from the performance evaluation of the machine, the shredding efficiency rate and efficiency was 164. 19 g/s and 91. 64 %, respectively. The mixing capacity was 12 kg of fish scraps and molasses with an acceptable mixing speed of 108 rpm, <b>and</b> a <b>mixing</b> time of 40 sec.

50|$|The raw {{material}} is yellow or red firing sea clay that is {{abundant in the}} west of the province of Friesland. Tichelaar bought German clay but also dug his own clay from the neighbouring countryside, leading to the local word 'afgeticheld' to describe a meadow that had been dug up. The clay was mixed with marl in the pottery washing plant and then stored in a cellar to keep it frost-free. Shortly before processing, the clay was thoroughly <b>kneaded</b> <b>and</b> <b>mixed</b> again <b>and</b> then cut to size or punched. After drying, it was baked to biscuit, called {{raw material}}, which was then covered in white on the front. On the back, the dishes got a layer of lead glaze. After the artists had applied their decoration to the lead glaze, they were fired a second time. Two sorts of glaze were used; one transparent and one usually white covering glaze, called lead glaze and white glaze respectively, which were both prepared in the company. For the decoration, coloured glazes were prepared in the company. They were ground to a fine powder <b>and</b> when <b>mixed</b> with water, they could be used for painting. There were five colours (blue, purple, green, yellow and orange), though in practice it was usually blue and purple that were used.|$|R

40|$|The mapping {{method is}} a {{powerful}} simulation tool to optimize distributive mixing inside periodic mixers. Recently, a new approach of the mapping method was introduced to simulate distributive mixing inside dynamic, complex geometries in an open flow system (twin-screw extruders). Here we apply this approach of the mapping method to different <b>mixing</b> elements, both <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> screw <b>mixing</b> element (SME), inside a twin-screw extruder. The accuracy of the mapping method depends on {{the accuracy of the}} velocity field and these accurate 3 D velocity fields are here calculated using an extended finite element method. For the kneading elements a variety of staggering angles have been investigated, <b>and</b> the <b>mixing</b> performance of the SME element is compared with a standard conveying element. To better quantify the mixing performance, additional parameters like particle trajectories, residence time distribution and the volume-integrated, intensity of segregation are used as a mixing measure.

40|$|The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) {{has been}} working with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop methods for use in the Environmental RCRA/CERCLA program. Two {{standards}} being developed are guides to field compositing and laboratory subsampling. Correctly performed compositing and subsampling are critical in the chain of sampling and analytical events. They must be accomplished in compliance with project objectives and instructions to assure that the resulting data is representative. In a site characterization effort, the collection of composite samples may be used to estimate the mean concentration of a waste analyte in contaminated media. Other reasons to composite include reducing costs, efficiently determining the absence or possible presence of a hot spot, and, when coupled with retesting schemes, locating hot spots. If composite samples are collected, it is necessary to ensure that a representative sample is obtained for analysis. This may mean that samples must be <b>mixed</b> <b>and</b> subsampled using procedures that could include pan <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> quartering, a <b>mixing</b> square, <b>kneading,</b> sieving <b>and</b> <b>mixing,</b> <b>and</b> particle size reduction. Field subsampling procedures include use of a rectangular scoop, an alternate scoop technique, and the slab-cake methods.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to prepare and characterize inclusion complexes of clonazepam with β-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and to study the effect of complexation on the dissolution rate of clonazepam, a water-insoluble lipid-lowering drug. The phase-solubility profiles with both cyclodextrins were classified as AP-type, indicating the formation of 2 : 1 stoichiometric inclusion complexes. Gibbs free energy (ΔG_tr^o) values were all negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of clonazepam solubilization, and they decreased with increase in the cyclodextrins concentration, demonstrating that the reaction conditions became more favorable as the concentration of cyclodextrins increased. Complexes of clonazepam were prepared with cyclodextrins by various methods such as <b>kneading,</b> coevaporation, <b>and</b> physical <b>mixing.</b> The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies. These studies indicated that complex prepared <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> coevaporation methods showed successful inclusion of the clonazepam molecule into the cyclodextrins cavity. The complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility and wettability of clonazepam. Among all the samples, complex prepared with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin by kneading method showed highest improvement in in vitro dissolution rate of clonazepam. Mean dissolution time of clonazepam decreased significantly after preparation of complexes and physical mixture of clonazepam with cyclodextrins.

40|$|The {{effect of}} carrier payload <b>and</b> <b>mixing</b> {{time on the}} redispersion of drug {{particles}} from adhesive mixtures during inhalation for two different drugs (budesonide and disodium cromoglycate) has been investigated. A special test inhaler which retains carrier crystals during inhalation was used at 30 and 60 l/min. The special inhaler enabled the analysis of residual drug on the carrier yielding so called carrier residue (CR) values. Mixtures with carrier size fractions of 32 - 45; 150 - 200 and 250 - 355 μm, derived from marketed lactose brands, with increasing carrier payload (0. 4 - 6. 0 % w/w of drug) were prepared. It was found that with increasing carrier payload, the CR increases for the coarse carrier fraction, decreases for the fine fraction and remains roughly constant for the intermediate fraction at 30 l/min. At 60 l/min, the CR decreased for all carrier fractions with increasing payload. The effect of powder bulk properties on the adhesive forces between drug <b>and</b> carrier (during <b>mixing)</b> as well as changes in the balance between adhesion and separation forces (during inhalation) explain the results found. An improved understanding of the different effects is obtained through the recently introduced force distribution concept. The ratio of (mean) separation force to (mean) adhesion force increases with the flow rate. The adhesive forces (during mixing) increase with increasing carrier diameter (higher press-on <b>and</b> <b>kneading</b> forces) <b>and</b> longer <b>mixing</b> time. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

Using the same blend of wheat flour <b>and</b> keeping <b>mixing</b> <b>and</b> drying {{conditions}} constant, three types of spaghetti were produced using the following three <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> forming processes: A) kneading with a continuous press and forming by pressure-extrusion; B) <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> forming by sheeting-rolls; C) <b>kneading</b> by hand <b>and</b> forming with sheeting-rolls. These three processes impart different mechanical work on the dough. The three types of dried spaghetti exhibited differences in cooking requirements and in cooing quality. Spaghetti (A) absorbed water more slowly and showed poor cooking quality. Spaghetti (B) and (C) had a shorter cooking time, no stickiness and good firmness after cooking. Spaghetti compactness seems to control water absorption during cooking, i. e., the greater the compactness, the longer the cooking time. Nevertheless, compactness does not explain differences in cooking quality. On the contrary, this characteristic is clearly related to the different organization of proteins, as transmission and scanning electron microscopy images revealed. In fact both spaghetti (B) and (C) showed a compact and continuous protein network, probably {{as a consequence of}} the mild <b>and</b> ordered <b>kneading</b> obtained by the sheeting process. Spaghetti (A), produced by dough kneading implying strong mechanical stresses, exhibited protein network breakage which may account for its poor cooking quality. The results of the present work indicate that industrial <b>kneading</b> <b>and</b> extrusion, as performed today in the continuous press, are unsuitable for making the best use of poor quality raw materials.
