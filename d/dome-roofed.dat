2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} about this church before the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. The {{appellation}} [...] "troullos" [...] (Latin trullus, Italian trullo, dome) probably comes from a <b>dome-roofed</b> palace {{that used to be}} in the neighborhood. [...] The style of construction dates the building to the 12th century.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{ascended the}} spiral of a {{vertical}} way for some time, and then {{passed through a}} series of huge halls <b>dome-roofed</b> and elaborately decorated. The approach to the Grand Lunar was certainly contrived to give one a vivid impression of his greatness. Each cavern one entered seemed greater and more boldly arched than its predecessor. This effect of progressive size was enhanced by a thin haze of faintly phosphorescent blue incense that thickened as one advanced, and robbed even the nearer figures of clearness. I seemed to advance continually to something larger, dimmer, and less material.|$|E
60|$|The curious insect which {{thus serves}} as an {{animated}} sweetmeat for the Mexican children is the honey-ant of the Garden of the Gods; and it affords a beautiful example of Mandeville's charming paradox that personal vices are public benefits--vitia privata humana commoda. The honey-ant is a greedy individual who has nevertheless nobly devoted himself {{for the good of}} the community by converting himself into a living honey-jar, from which all the other ants in his own nest may help themselves freely from time to time, as occasion demands. The tribe to which he belongs lives underground, in a <b>dome-roofed</b> vault, and only one particular caste among the workers, known as rotunds from their expansive girth, is told off for this special duty of storing honey within their own bodies. Clinging to the top of their nest, with their round, transparent abdomens hanging down loosely, mere globules of skin enclosing the pale amber-coloured honey, these Daniel Lamberts of the insect race look for all the world like clusters of the little American Delaware grapes, with an ant's legs and head stuck awkwardly on to the end instead of a stalk. They have, in fact, realised in everyday life the awful fate of Mr. Gilbert's discontented sugar-broker, who laid on flesh and 'adipose deposit' until he became converted at last into a perfect rolling ball of globular humanity.|$|E
50|$|In the park, you {{can also}} find a {{classical}} garden pavilion with a round ground-plan and added lateral wings. The pavilion, with its large semicircular windows, is covered by a <b>dome-roof.</b> It was built in 1800 to serve as a greenhouse. Until recently it was used for storing tools for the maintenance of the park, then it was turned into an aqua-center with a sauna, massages, and a pool. At present it is abandoned.|$|R
40|$|In this work, dome {{structures}} in PVDF films were prepared as ultrasonic transducer. The domes are realized by a deep drawing process. The dome-forming process {{leads to a}} phase transformation from the non-polar alpha into the polar beta phase within dome wall and roof of the PVDF films. A ferroelectric polarization is obtained in these dome areas after suitable electrical poling which yields a piezoelectric activity. Because of the piezoelectric activity within the film plane, a <b>dome-roof</b> up-and-down actuation is observed with resonance frequencies in the range between 65 and 93 kHz...|$|R

50|$|Charles Koch Arena (formerly Henry Levitt Arena) at Wichita State University, a medium-sized, sunken, <b>dome-roofed</b> {{circular}} arena with a collegiate basketball court. Home to the WSU Shocker basketball team. Also {{used extensively}} for citywide and regional high school athletic events, concerts and other entertainments.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dome-roofed</b> Balai Sarbini {{auditorium}} and {{the adjoining}} Gedung Veteran, {{also called the}} Graha Purna Yudha tower, were the buildings that were located on {{the northeast corner of}} Semanggi cloverleaf bridge. Both buildings were built by President Sukarno in 1965 for the Indonesian Veterans Legion to look after the interests of veterans who had fought against foreign aggression to maintain Indonesia's independence. Funding shortages meant they were not completed until 1973 and then opened by President Suharto.|$|E
50|$|In {{the north}} of the castle area, there are Turkish baths with typical vaulted roofs. Just after the entrance, the Kria Vrisi tank is on right hand. It is a large semi-underground water {{reservoir}} with vaults forming four quarters divided by a cross on its roof that are supported by eight shafts. Then Chian press of the time mentions that in 1920 the Mayor of Chios and architect Dim. Tselepidis had set out its cleaning. “The pumping of water was originally performed through a large <b>dome-roofed</b> elevated arcade that was extending all along {{the eastern part of the}} tank and later on through a short cistern in its southeast corner.” Professor Char. Bouras mentioned about the tank.|$|E
5000|$|The second mill began {{producing}} {{nails in}} 1814, {{and five years}} later its owner, Ruggles Whiting of Boston, sold it to {{the owner of the}} first mill, George Bird, who began using the whole site to manufacture paper. In 1823 it switched to cotton, using the machinery of the former Norfolk Cotton Company. In 1835 a new stone mill was erected. It stands today, and was converted into a condominium complex in 1986-87. Unlike the other mills, which were constructed in a strictly utiliatrian style, this factory boasted a date stone reading [...] "1835" [...] and a <b>dome-roofed</b> cupola over the mill bell. Together they stood as a testament to the primacy of the mills in the neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Wichita Ice Arena, {{also just}} west of downtown, is a public ice-skating rink used for ice-skating competitions. In addition, Century II {{has been used for}} {{professional}} wrestling tournaments, sporting-goods exhibitions, and other recreational activity. The WSU campus includes two major venues: Eck Stadium, a medium-sized stadium with a full-sized baseball field that is home to the WSU Shocker baseball team, and Charles Koch Arena, a medium-sized, <b>dome-roofed</b> circular arena with a collegiate basketball court that hosts the WSU Shocker basketball team. Koch Arena is also used extensively for citywide and regional high school athletic events, concerts and other entertainments. Located just north of the city is 81 Motor Speedway, an oval motor-vehicle racetrack used extensively {{for a wide range of}} car, truck and motorcycle races, and other motor sports events. Neighboring Park City is home to Hartman Arena and the Sam Fulco Pavilions, a moderate-capacity low-roofed arena developed for small rodeos, horse shows, livestock competitions, and exhibitions.|$|E
