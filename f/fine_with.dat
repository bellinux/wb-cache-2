5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe he did so deliberately. Nevertheless, {{it is clear that}} My Sweet Lord is the very same song as He's So <b>Fine</b> <b>with</b> different words, and Harrison had access to He's So Fine. This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E

5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and that additional airlines {{be allowed to}} start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen.

The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk {{lost control}} {{on the line and}} derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This was not sufficient, and Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But this would be costly, as the vehicles would have to be upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and <b>fine,</b> <b>with</b> an appeal judge accusing the Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in contempt.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> at first no sign of the Ottoman Army.|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{reaction of}} saline stress which Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. plants undergo shows a greater growth and fresh substance gain process on previously cultivated soils that were <b>fined</b> <b>with</b> 20 % zeolitic tuff and 5. 09 g of neutral peat {{than the ones}} that had a substrate which hasn’t been cultivated on before that was <b>fined</b> <b>with</b> 5 % zeolitic tuff and 1. 39 g of perlite. The dry substance values obtained present a positive correlation with the values of fresh substance. Analysis of stomatal conductance enhances the hydric stress of plants which respond to saline stress with osmotic adjustment, accumulating high quantities of water comparing to the witness plant, which induces lower values of stomatal conductance and implicitly values are decreasing for photosynthesis, determining a low productivity. Higher values of stomatal conductance are reached at plants grown on previously cultivated soils <b>fined</b> <b>with</b> 20 % zeolitic tuff and peat, and also at the ones grown on uncultivated soils <b>fined</b> <b>with</b> peat (29. 45, respectively 30. 05 mmol/m 2 /s) ...|$|R

5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Phoenix Coyotes via free agency in 2005 and signed a one-year deal. On October 28, 2005, he won his 400th NHL game. On March 28, 2006, he posted his 424th career win, thereby moving into sixth place on the NHL's all-time list, passing Tony Esposito. Joseph had shown {{interest}} in re-joining the Toronto Maple Leafs, indicating {{that he would be}} <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> a back-up role and a reduced salary. In September 2007 the Ottawa Senators quietly expressed interest in acquiring Joseph if they could unload Martin Gerber and his large contract. Joseph was a member of Team Canada in the 2007 Spengler Cup, leading them to the championship on December 31, 2007. While he was with the Coyotes, Curtis became the first goaltender to have 50 or more wins in a regular season for five different teams (St. Louis, Edmonton, Toronto, Detroit, and Phoenix).|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and <b>fine,</b> <b>with</b> a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E

It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy.
