50|$|Perennial {{crops are}} crops {{developed}} to reduce inputs necessary to produce food. By <b>greatly</b> <b>reducing</b> {{the need to}} replant crops from year-to-year, perennial cropping can reduce topsoil losses due to erosion, increase biological carbon sequestration within the soil, and <b>greatly</b> <b>reduce</b> waterway pollution through agricultural runoff.|$|R

5|$|Much of the river's {{catchment}} area consists of cleared farmland with run-off captured in private dams to sustain farming over Adelaide's dry summer. Combined with the river's use for potable water this has <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced</b> the overall flow {{especially in the}} lower river.|$|E

The pectoralis and supracoracoideus muscles are <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced.</b> The propatagialis tendo longus has no distinct muscle belly. The sternocoracoideus is tendinous. There is an extensive cucularis capitis clavicularis muscle that {{is associated with}} the large crop.|$|E
5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced</b> by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its close}} {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes on their way to Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced</b> by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|During {{this long}} period {{the number of}} the Indians was <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced.</b> Their blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. They had no {{internal}} government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' as a witness called it, and often leaving for long periods and working in some menial capacity for the whites.|$|E

5|$|Seabird {{mortality}} {{caused by}} long-line fisheries can be <b>greatly</b> <b>reduced</b> by {{techniques such as}} setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of drift nets has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled.
