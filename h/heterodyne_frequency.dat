2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{effect was}} predicted by Lord Rayleigh {{in his classic}} book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but backwards. The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters. [...] Neil A Downie has demonstrated [...] how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency</b> converter, as used in many bat detectors, {{to listen to a}} band around 40kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.|$|E

This detector performs a spatially resolving measurement of the phasefront of a heterodyne interferometer, with <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to approximately 10 kHz.

5000|$|There {{are three}} types of [...] "real time" [...] audio bat {{detector}} in common use: the <b>heterodyne,</b> <b>frequency</b> division, and time expansion. Some bat detectors combine two or all three types.|$|E
50|$|The {{input signal}} for the analog tract {{is at the}} {{intermediate}} frequency or in the L-band, in the second case it must be firstly converted to IF. Then the signal is either sampled or processed by the four-quadrant multiplier which produces the complex envelope components (I, Q) through multiplying it by the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{heterodyne}} bat detector {{will only}} handle a small range of bat frequencies, {{so it is}} necessary to keep retuning the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency</b> to find the point of maximum loudness or, in the case of bats with a hockey stick call, the frequency which gives the lowest sound. This gives the lowest plop sound from the CF end of the calls.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{preceding}} systems, 8mm {{did not use}} {{a control}} track on the tape to facilitate the head following the diagonal tracks. Instead 8mm recorded a sequence of four sine waves on each video track such that adjacent tracks would produce one of two <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies</b> if the head mistracked. The system automatically adjusted the tracking such that the two frequencies produced were of equal magnitude. This system {{was derived from the}} dynamic track following (DTF) used by the Philips Video 2000 system. Sony rechristened the system as automatic track following (ATF) as the 8mm system lacked the ability of the heads to physically move within the head drum.|$|R
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies</b> fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|R
5000|$|The two signals {{combine in}} a device called a mixer. As {{seen in the}} {{previous}} section, an ideal mixer would be a device that multiplies the two signals. Some widely used mixer circuits, such as the Gilbert cell, operate in this way, but they are limited to lower frequencies. However, any nonlinear electronic component also multiplies signals applied to it, producing <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies</b> in its outputâ€”so a variety of nonlinear components serve as mixers. A nonlinear component {{is one in which}} the output current or voltage is a nonlinear function of its input. Most circuit elements in communications circuits are designed to be linear. This means they obey the superposition principle; if F(v) is the output of a linear element with an input of v: ...|$|R
5000|$|So {{the output}} {{contains}} sinusoidal terms with frequencies at the sum [...] and difference [...] {{of the two}} original frequencies. It also contains terms at the original frequencies and at multiples of the original frequencies , , , , etc.; the latter are called harmonics, {{as well as more}} complicated terms at frequencies of , called intermodulation products. These unwanted frequencies, along with the unwanted <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency,</b> must be filtered out of the mixer output by an electronic filter to leave the desired heterodyne.|$|E
50|$|At the UK National Bat Conference, Wildlife Acoustics {{announced}} the Echo Meter handheld bat detector. The device {{will be available}} in December 2011. The detector is capable of monitoring for bats using <b>heterodyne,</b> <b>frequency</b> division or Real Time Expansion (RTE). RTE is Wildlife Acoustics proprietary technique for shifting bat sounds to the audible range while maintaining distinctive temporal and spectral characteristics of the call. In addition, the EM3 can record in full spectrum and/or zero-cross to an SD card while monitoring. A real time spectrogram shows calls as they are happening while monitoring and/or recording. The spectrogram can be scrolled back to analyze the spectrogram of previous bat calls. Calls can be played back using time expansion.|$|E

5000|$|He also {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} device, the Goldschmidt tone wheel, used in early radio receivers {{to receive the}} new continuous wave radiotelegraph signals. The first radio transmitter, the spark-gap transmitter, produced a string of damped waves {{that sounded like a}} buzz or tone in a radio receiver, so the pulses of radio waves used to transmit Morse code were audible as [...] "beeps" [...] in the receiver. However, the new transmitters like the Goldschmidt alternator generated unmodulated continuous waves, which were inaudible in receivers. To make them audible, the tone wheel receiver used the heterodyne principle to convert the radio frequency to an audio frequency. The tone wheel was a disk with contacts around the rim, spun by a small electric motor, which interrupted the incoming radio signal at a radio frequency rate. The tone wheel acted as a crude beat frequency oscillator (BFO), introducing a second radio frequency which combined with the received signal to create a [...] "beat" [...] (<b>heterodyne)</b> <b>frequency</b> at the difference of the two frequencies, in the audio range. For example, if the frequency of the received signal was 60,000 Hz, the tone wheel could be adjusted to introduce a frequency of 59,000 Hz, creating a 1,000 Hz tone which could be heard in the earphones as a musical [...] "beep" [...] whenever the carrier was present.|$|E

40|$|Arm locking is a {{technique}} that has been proposed for reducing laser frequency fluctuations in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a gravitational-wave observatory sensitive in the milliHertz frequency band.

We have implemented a time-domain simulation of arm locking including the expected limiting noise sources (shot noise, clock noise, spacecraft jitter noise, and residual laser frequency noise). The effect of imperfect a priori knowledge of the LISA <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies</b> and the associated 'pulling' of an arm locked laser is included.

The W 7 -X stellarator will employ a two-color CO 2 (10. 591 m) and CO (5. 295 m) heterodyne-infrared interferometer as an electronic density measurement diagnostic. The frequency displacement is 40 MHz for the CO 2 wavelength and 25 MHz for the CO, so these values will fix the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Because the frequency {{gap between the two}} carriers is wide enough and the detector sensitivity is similar for both wavelengths, it is possible to use a single detector for the two signals; nevertheless, they should be split with filters. Traditionally, the intermediate-frequency signals should be filtered, downconverted to a lower frequency by the use of analog circuitry, and then processed. A new approach is proposed. The intermediate-frequency signals are directly sampled by means of high-speed analog-to-digital converters followed by a digital diplexer and a specific phase-meter processor implemented in a field-programmable gate array.
