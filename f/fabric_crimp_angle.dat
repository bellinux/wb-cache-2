The model {{is used to}} fit mechanical tension test data from the equine common digital extensor tendon (CDET) and superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT), which are used as archetypes of positional and energy-storing tendons, respectively. The fibril crimp and fascicle helix angles of the two tendon types are used as fitting parameters in the mathematical model to predict their values. The outer fibril <b>crimp</b> <b>angles</b> were predicted to be 15. 1 Â° Â± 2. 3 Â° in the CDET and 15. 8 Â° Â± 4. 1 Â° in the SDFT, and the average <b>crimp</b> <b>angles</b> were predicted to be 10. 0 Â° Â± 1. 5 Â° in the CDET and 10. 5 Â° Â± 2. 7 Â° in the SDFT.

40|$|A {{series of}} studies was {{conducted}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that galloping exercise changes the morphology of collagen fibrils in the superficial digital flexor tendon of the equine forelimb. Tendons were examined from three groups of horses, namely wild horses, randomly sourced thoroughbred horses submitted for necropsy, and thoroughbreds from an experimental exercise trial. All tendons examined were from horses with no history of superficial digital flexor tendonitis, and all were macroscopically normal. Three studies involved the measurement of collagen fibril bundle 'crimp' morphology. The crimp, a planar waveform followed by the fibrils, is believed to determine in part the mechanical behaviour of tendon. The first study involved measurement of <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> and period length in central and peripheral regions of tendons from wild ponies ranging in age from two to over ten years, which had obviously never undergone training. Horses of ten years of age or older showed a mean <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> in the central region which was lower than that in the periphery. It was concluded that the reduction in central region <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> with age in untrained horses is a normal fatigue effect. The second study involved measurement of crimp parameters in central and peripheral regions of tendons from horses of two years and over which had been submitted for necropsy to Massey University. These horses were separated into 'exercised' and 'non-exercised' groups based on whether their most recent function had involved competitive galloping exercise. Five of the eight exercised horses under ten years of age had a lower mean <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> and length in the central region than in the peripheral region. No un-exercised horses in this age group showed lower values for either parameter in the central region as opposed to the periphery. It was therefore concluded that rapid high-strain cycling of the tendon occurring during galloping exercise modifies normal age-related changes in the crimp morphology of the superficial digital flexor tendon core. For the third study, <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> and length were measured in tendons from five thoroughbreds (39 ± 1 months of age) which had undergone a specific 18 month exercise regime involving galloping on a high-speed equine treadmill, and from six age- and sex-matched thoroughbreds which had undergone walking exercise only during that period. Central region <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> and length were significantly lower in the tendons of exercised horses compared to the controls. Four of the five exercised horses showed a significantly lower <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> in the central region than in the periphery, and three of these horses also showed a lower central crimp length. The peripheral angle was significantly greater in the exercised horses than in the controls. This was evidence that a specific and defined regime of high-strain cycling of the superficial digital flexor tendon modified age-related crimp morphology changes in the central region. Two studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of the above defined exercise regime on collagen fibril diameter distributions in the superficial digital flexor tendons, and in the deep digital flexor tendons and suspensory ligaments from the same horses. Central region fibrils in superficial digital flexor tendons from exercised horses had a significantly lower mass-average diameter than those from the control horses, whereas peripheral region fibrils from the two groups did not differ significantly. In the second study collagen fibril mass-average diameters in both regions of the deep digital flexor tendon and the suspensory ligament were not found to differ significantly in exercised horses compared to controls. It was concluded that the exercise regime had caused breakdown of large diameter collagen fibrils in the core of the superficial digital flexor tendon. The fact that such a change did not occur in the suspensory ligament was suggested to be due to a difference in distribution of load between the suspensory ligament and superficial digital flexor tendon during galloping, or due to differences in distribution of such changes along the lengths of the two structures. The final study involved an age-related analysis of crimp parameters, collagen fibril diameters and biochemical factors in thoroughbreds from foetuses to 3 years of age. It was suggested {{on the basis of the}} limited results, that collagen fibrils in the central region of the superficial digital flexor tendon become mature between one and two years of age. It is proposed that the observed reductions in crimp morphology and collagen fibril mass-average diameter in the core of the superficial digital flexor tendon in response to galloping exercise represent microtrauma, as they would lead to weakness of the structure and predispose it to overloading and further damage. The mechanisms involved are suggested to involve slippage and/or separation of subfibrils, and a mechanism for the development of tendon core lesions is hypothesized. The use of the present information for the prevention of tendonitis is discussed...|$|R

Five common commercially pressed cores (1080, 2116, 2313, 3313, 7628) were obtained from Polyclad, Inc. The cores consisted of either one or two plies of C-staged woven glass epoxy substrate sandwiched between 1 ounce copper cladding.

All of the substrates showed significant differences in microstructure and material properties between the warp and fill directions.

The research focuses on fibre-reinforced composites, with the stochastic analyses of an existing analytical failure model for unidirectional composites and of a unit cell numerical model of a 2 D 5 -Harness satin weave. Stochastic failure envelopes are generated through parallelised Monte Carlo Simulation of deterministic, analytical, physically based failure criteria for unidirectional carbon fibre/epoxy matrix composite plies. Monte Carlo integration of global variance-based Sobol sensitivity indices is performed and utilised to decompose observed variance within stochastic failure envelopes into contributions from physical input parameters. It is observed how the interaction effect {{can be used to}} identify domains of bi-modal failure, within which the predicted failure probability is governed by multiple failure modes. A reduced unit cell (rUC) model of a 5 -Harness satin weave is constructed and analysed deterministically in uniaxial and biaxial loading conditions. An algorithm is developed and implemented to fully automate the rUC construction such that stochastic variations of the <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> can be evaluated. Monte Carlo Simulation is employed to propagate the effect of the <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> through the deterministic model and the probabilistic response compared with data obtained experimentally. It is observed how simulated variability compares well in uni-axial compression, but under-predicts observed experimental variability in uni-axial tension. The influence of vertical stacking sequence of plies is also demonstrated through the study of in-phase and out-of-phase periodic boundary conditions. The research highlights various, potential advantages that stochastic methodologies offer over the traditional deterministic approach, making a case for their application in engineering design and providing a springboard for further research come the day when greater computational power is available.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of investigations to determine how process settings and crimp geometry affect the seal strength and integrity of traditional polyolefin and biopolymer flexible packaging materials. The results show agreement with previous studies where temperature and dwell time are found to be the dominant factors for both polyolefin and biopolymer films. Pressure and crimp geometry are shown to be secondary factors in the process, up to the point of squeezing the film into molecular contact. In general it is shown that biopolymers exhibit similar sealing characteristics to more traditional films. In respect of the sealing crimp geometry it is shown that the crimp pitch has little or no effect on sealing integrity for films with gauges between 25 µm and 40 µm. But, for the same gauge material, <b>crimp</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 80 ° offer the greatest potential to gain higher seal strengths.

40|$|A {{microstructure}} {{model of}} 2 -D braided composite is developed. The fiber volume and <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> are evaluated by this model and are compared with experimental results. The maximum fiber volume fraction is also obtained. Effective stiffness of 2 -D braided composite is obtained {{in a close}} form by the analysis of elastic deformation energy in repeat-unit-cell of braided composites. Effective stiffness consists of contributions of axial yarn, braiding yarn, and matrix material. Each of them takes a different weight in the effective stiffness. The weights of contribution of axial yarn, braiding yarn, and matrix material are χ Vf/k, (1 -χ) Vf/k, and (1 -Vf/k) respectively, where Vf is the fiber volume fraction, χ is the axial yarn content in a braided composite, and k is the filament packing fraction. The results of effective stiffness from theoretical prediction are very good as compared with test data from experiments. Effective coefficients of thermal and hygro expansion are analyzed by virtual energy method.

40|$|The {{performance}} of woven fabric in many technical applications, such as airbags or reinforced composites, relates to fabric through-thickness permeability. A unified analytical model for woven fabric through-thickness permeability is proposed. It involves flow through gaps between yarns {{and within the}} yarns in terms of fabric porosity. The yarn permeability {{is a combination of}} flow along and transverse to unidirectional fibres. It is a function of fibre radius, fibre volume fraction, fibre array and <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> of interwoven yarns. The gap permeability is developed based on viscous and incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flow in the gaps at low R_e values. The gap is simplified as a smooth fluid channel at the centre with slowly varying circular cross-section. The shape of the channel is approximated by a parabolic function. Volumetric flow rate is formulated as a function of pressure drop and flow channel geometry for the gap. The gap permeability is calculated thereafter according to Darcy’s law. For a woven fabric subjected to a high pressure load, an energy-based model is developed to predict the fabric out-of-plane deformation using minimum energy theory and an isotropic assumption for woven fabric. The model can predict the fabric maximum displacement and corresponding deflected profile across a diameter given a pressure load. The fabric deflection can be used to obtain the fabric elongation (strain) which results in the change of gap size, yarn width, yarn shape and fabric thickness in loose fabric (clear gaps between yarns) and the change of fibre volume fraction and <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> in tight <b>fabric</b> (overlapping yarns). The deformed fabric permeability is calculated by the unified permeability model based on the assumptions of the variation of geometric factors with deformation. If a woven fabric is subjected to a high decreasing pressure drop by air discharge, the fabric permeability is obtained by fitting pressure history and corresponding flow velocity using the Forchheimer equation. A nonlinear relationship is found between the pressure and velocity where the corresponding permeability is also called the dynamic permeability. The high pressure causes the shape of flow streamlines to vary in the gap between yarns (viewed as a converging-diverging duct). This flow behaviour is modelled by adding a non-Darcy term to Darcy’s law according to continuity theory and the Bernoulli equation. Therefore, a predictive Forchheimer equation is given for flow behaviour in a woven fabric based on the fabric geometry, structure and flow situation. The developed analytical models were verified by CFD simulations and experiments in this thesis. The comparisons showed good agreements. Sensitivity studies were conducted to understand the effects of geometric factors and mechanical properties on the fabric deformation and permeability. In this thesis, two pieces of equipment in particular were introduced for measuring the fabric dynamic permeability and fabric out-of-plane deformation. The measurements agreed well with their corresponding analytical predictions. Finally, the comparison of fabric deformation and non-Darcy flow showed the importance of fabric deformation in affecting the final fabric permeability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{scoliosis}} includes wedge deformities of both vertebrae and discs, {{little is}} known about the causes of the discal changes, and whether they result from mechanical influences on growth and/or remodelling. Methods and Materials: An external apparatus attached to transvertebral pins applied compression and 15 degrees of angulation to each of two adjacent young rat caudal intervertebral discs for 5 weeks (four animals), or for 10 weeks (four animals). Each week, micro-CT scanning documented the in vivo discal wedging. After euthanasia, tail segments (three vertebrae and the 2 angulated discs) were excised and their flexibility was measured over a range of lateral bending. The angle of maximum flexibility was recorded. Then discs were fixed in situ (with the external apparatus in place) and sectioned for polarized light microscopy. Results: The disc-wedging deformity averaged 15 degrees initially, it averaged 20 degrees after 5 weeks, and then reduced to 10 degrees (in 10 week animals). The lateral bending flexibility showed a distinct maximum at an average of 1. 1 degrees from the in vivo position in the 5 -week animals, indicating structural remodeling of the discs almost to the deformed geometry. The 10 -week animals had maximum flexibility at 1. 4 degrees from the in vivo position (no significant difference between 5 and 10 -week animals.)

Although high fiber packing is desirable, yarn crimping (especially in the axial fiberyarns) is undesirable. Significant axial yarn <b>crimp</b> <b>angles</b> (greater than 10 deg) have been measured in braided composites. Comparable levels of crimping have been found to produce significant compressive strength reductions in laminated composites consisting of planar fiber sheets. Thus, axial yarn crimping is suspected of producing significant reductions in compressive strength allowables for braided composites. The objective of this research is to quantify the reduction in compressive strength as a function of axial yarn crimp severity. Since crimp severity can be reduced by lowering the compaction pressure during curing, the resulting compressive strengths may be used to determine optimum processing conditions. A 'cure-on-the-loom' manufacturing process was developed to produce braided composites with controlled levels of crimping. This method allowed for controlled levels of tension to be placed on the axial yarns and maintained during the curing process. With increasing tension, the crimp severity in the axial yarns was reduced. Thus, varying crimp severities were produced ranging from conventional levels (greater than 10 deg) to virtually straight axial yarns. Test results indicate that a 30 % increase in compressive strength is obtainable by eliminating axial yarn crimping. Further compression testing is underway to quantify the relationship between crimp severity and compressive strength. Additional testing is planned to investigate the effect of crimping on the open-hole compressive strength, often considered a more significant design allowable...|$|R

Despite the wealth of morphological information about the extracellular matrix in this joint, little is known regarding {{the involvement of the}} crimp of collagen fibers in the dramatic transformations occurring in this region during the last 3 days of pregnancy. Examination of the collagenous architecture suggests that the biomechanical properties are directly related to fibril diameters, composition of ground substance and changes in the bundle morphology, particularly in the crimp structure. {{the purpose of this study}} was to further describe the transformation of the collagen fibers of the pubic symphysis during late mouse pregnancy. We examined the architecture of collagen fibers in the symphysis and pubic ligament through the Picrosirius-polarization method and also through scanning electron microscopy to directly visualize and measure the crimping from pregnant and virgin mice. the <b>crimp</b> <b>angle</b> and the length of five consecutive crimps were measured according to Patterson-Kane et al. [Connect. Tissue Res. 36 (1997) 253]. It could be demonstrated that the angles progressively decreased and the crimp length increased, denoting that the fibers have untwisted during the relaxation process. Our findings suggest that a disruption of the helical arrangement of the collagen containing fibers may contribute to explaining the rapid remodeling that occurs at the end of pregnancy and that is responsible for an increase in pliancy and length of the pubic ligament in mice.

40|$|A {{woven fabric}} {{structure}} {{is defined by}} mutual threads interlacing in the fabric {{as well as the}} basic parameters of the fabric. The interrelation among fabric parameters can be obtained by considering a geometrical model of the fabric and specific experimental methods. The geometrical model is mainly concerned with the shape taken up by the yarn in the warp or weft cross-section of the fabric. This article provides a possible methodology for evaluation of geometric parameters of threads in the real longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of fabric. From an individual cross-section of the fabric using image analysis it is possible to define the diameter of threads, their deformation, thread spacing, the maximum displace-ment (height of binding wave) of the thread axis, the angle of the thread axis (interlacing angle), the length of the thread axis in the cross-section of the <b>fabric,</b> the <b>crimp</b> of threads in the fabric, and the real shape of the binding wave through wave coordinates. The pa-rameters mentioned are possible to use as input for mathematical modelling of the fabric structure and for prediction of mechanical and end-use properties of fabrics.

40|$|Producing {{composite}} parts using low-cost {{processes such as}} resin {{transfer moulding}} (RTM) has received much interest in the aerospace industry. RTM manufactured components require near net shape preforms which closely fit mould cavities. To reduce labour costs associated with composite production, automated preforming processes must be utilized. However, obtaining reproducible high quality preforms is required for manufacturing consistent high quality parts. Stitched multilayer 3 D non <b>crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> preforms are well suited for automation and an investigation into quality and performance of components manufactured from these preforms is required. This thesis provides an initial evaluation of quality and mechanical properties of components made from stitched multilayer 3 D non <b>crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> preforms using RTM. Similar sized flat plates of varying fibre volume fractions were manufactured to evaluate flexural modulus and strength, short beam shear strength and drop weight impact resistance of the material. Also, integral reinforced panels (IRPs) featuring a reinforcing section joined to a flat plate of varying laminating sequences were manufactured to evaluate debonding strength between sections. Optical microscopy was performed on component samples to determine quality based on void content and {{was found to be}} within acceptable limits for production composites. Flexural moduli were found to be comparable with theoretical expected values, however flexural strength was limited by the presence of transverse stitches. Short beam shear strength results showed high consistency between specimens, however were lower than comparable values found in literature. Impact specimens showed consistency among specimens, with greater damage resistance than comparable values found in literature. Determining debonding strength proved difficult as different failure modes were observed between IRPs, however, initial baseline values were acquired...|$|R

A large quantity of {{studies have been conducted}} on ballistic impacts of high tensile strength fabrics (Cunniff 1992; Bazhenov 1997; Starratt et al. 2000; Tan et al. 2003; Cheeseman and Bogetti 2003; Duana et al. 2005, 2006 b; Nilakantan et al. 2010; Parga-Landa and Hernandez-Olivares 1995; Billon and Robinson 2001; Zheng et al. 2006; Nilakantan et al. 2011). The effects of friction have been studies on ballistic impact behavior on high tensile strength fabrics (Duana et al. 2005, 2006 a).
