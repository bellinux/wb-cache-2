[...] Parker explains that doing a story like Angela's Ashes was simply his [...] "reaction against a big film" [...] like Evita.

[...] Milne later clarified his position: “What I actually said was that the three people who had run the television service for the past four or five years had not, it seemed to me, done a marvellous job. I would have said the same if they had been mice or men. They happened to be women and then I was stitched up by The Times.” ...|$|E
5000|$|William Goldman {{first came}} across the story of Butch Cassidy in the late 1950s and {{researched}} it {{on and off for}} eight years before sitting down to write the screenplay. Goldman says he wrote the story as an original screenplay because {{he did not want to}} do the research to make it authentic as a novel. Goldman later stated:The whole reason I wrote the ... thing, there is that famous line that Scott Fitzgerald wrote, who was one of my heroes, [...] "There are no second acts in American lives." [...] When I read about Cassidy and Longbaugh and the superposse coming after them—that's phenomenal material. They ran to South America and lived there for eight years and that was what thrilled me: they had a second act. They were more legendary in South America than they had been in the old West ... It's a great story. Those two guys and that pretty girl going down to South America and all that stuff. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it's a wonderful piece of material.|$|E

5000|$|Killing Them Softly {{is based}} on the 1974 novel Cogan's Trade by George V. Higgins, a best selling crime novelist whose works include The Friends of Eddie Coyle. Cogan's Trade, like Higgins's other novels, takes place in Boston; {{although}} filmed in New Orleans area, characters in Killing Them Softly make several references to Boston area suburbs from the original novel. The film was written and directed by Andrew Dominik, who chose to update the setting of the story, saying [...] "as I started adapting it, it was the story of an economic crisis, and it was an economic crisis in an economy that was funded by gambling—and the crisis occurred due to a failure in regulation. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have something that you couldn't ignore." ...|$|R

In making his 1981 re-recording of the Goldberg Variations, Glenn Gould considered playing this variation at a slower tempo, in keeping with the tempo of the preceding variation (Variation 16), but ultimately decided not to because [...] "Variation 17 is one of those rather skittish, slightly empty-headed collections of scales and arpeggios which Bach indulged when he wasn’t writing sober and proper things like fugues and canons, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me that there wasn't enough substance to it to warrant such a methodical, deliberate, Germanic tempo." ...|$|R
