25|$|The {{earliest}} royal heraldic badge is a {{sprig of}} common broom, {{said to have}} been worn by Geoffrey of Anjou in his cap. The broom plant or Plantegenest (planta genista in medieval Latin), thus became Geoffrey's nickname; 'Plantagenet'. The heraldic device also became the name of the dynasty that was borne from him, which was to rule England for over 300 years. The Plantagenet kings would use this badge, sometimes combining it with other more personal devices. King Henry II used the 'planta genista' as well as an escarbuncle. King Richard <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> star and crescent device, which was also adopted by his brother King John. King Henry III adopted the broom sprig and the star and crescent. His son Edward I in addition to these, added the golden rose device that he inherited from his mother Eleanor of Provence. King Edward II further added the golden castle of Castile, inherited from his mother Eleanor of Castile.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} SpongeBob and Patrick {{playing a game}} of Eels and Escalators, which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders, was {{difficult}} for the crew to animate, since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location. According to the series' season 2 DVD commentary, it was planned to have a scene that had SpongeBob saying [...] "Go 'dolphin noise' yourself" [...] followed by Patrick saying [...] "'Dolphin noise' you too!" [...] during the Eels and Escalators game. It was removed in the final episode check {{because it would have}} been inappropriate for the younger audience. The initial decision to use dolphin noises in place of a traditional bleep was also influenced by concerns over the episode's suitability for its audience. Stephen Hillenburg recalled in 2016, [...] "I pitched the idea that SpongeBob and Patrick learn a swearword. Everyone said no. I couldn't even use a bleep. So <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> dolphin sound instead." ...|$|E

500|$|Weingartner said he {{received}} an offer large enough that [...] "I {{would not have to}} work {{for the rest of my}} life" [...] from an American studio but refused it, opting to produce the film with his own studio, y3film, and coop99, an Austrian studio. A low-budget film, it was funded by a €250,000 loan Weingartner obtained with his parents' house as collateral. His second feature film, The Edukators was shot with hand-held digital cameras, allowing the director [...] "to explore the space and give actors license to go wherever they wanted." [...] Weingartner wanted a technically simple film focused on the actors. His decision to have a low budget was measured: [...] "More money means more pressure. This way, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> limited crew and was able to set the shooting schedule the way I wanted it - usually. The huge advantage of this kind of film-making is that it's rapid." [...] Most of the film was shot in Berlin, except for scenes in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
500|$|... "I Care" [...] {{comprised}} 75 {{tracks in}} total: 35 {{for the music}} and 40 for the vocals. According to Swivel, the main challenge in mixing [...] "I Care" [...] was hand‑aligning every single drum shot as it was time-consuming. He said, [...] "It's super‑monotonous, but it's the best way I can do it. If you Beat Detective the drums to the grid, it's never perfect." [...] As the layering of the drums had to be right on the millisecond, Swivel did one kick and snare at a time. This helped him ensure that the kicks line up with the programmed drums, hence preventing any phase inversion. Accordingly, each drum punched through as strongly as the last. The inspiration for the main drum sound on [...] "I Care" [...] came to Swivel at around four {{o'clock in the morning}} during a mixing session. He took a large plate sound from Avid’s D‑Verb plug‑in, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6kHz, and sent it through an SSL channel strip with a gate on it, setting the release time to 0.6 seconds. He said, [...] "It's a really basic plug‑in, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> very 80s‑sounding gated reverb." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wars of Independence {{brought the}} first {{recorded}} instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland. Edward <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> range of siege engines, which were carefully constructed, transported, deployed, dismantled and stored for reuse. This {{began with the}} siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300. Here, after the failure of an initial assault, a small rock-throwing engine was employed, while three large engines (probably trebuchet, using a counter-weight mechanism), were constructed. Their destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender. Edward's armies deployed several such engines, often named, with [...] "Warwolf", one of 17 used in the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304, being the best known. They also deployed lighter bolt-shooting balistas, belfry siege towers and on one occasion a covered sow. Some of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick, the future Robert I, who was present on the English side. Scottish armies, with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault, blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics. Robert I {{is known to have}} employed siege engines against the English, but often with little success, as at Carlisle in 1315 where his siege tower floundered in mud. The disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I.|$|E
