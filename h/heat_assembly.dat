50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a heating chamber {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the <b>heating</b> <b>assembly</b> is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the <b>heating</b> <b>assembly</b> are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the <b>heating</b> <b>assembly</b> has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the <b>heating</b> <b>assembly</b> to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety shut-off switch turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{summarize}} {{the results of}} detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic evaluations of the heat pipe cooled thermionic (HPTI) reactor design, identify its key design attributes, and quantify its performance characteristics. The HPTI core uses modular, liquid-metal core <b>heat</b> transfer <b>assemblies</b> to replace the liquid-metal heat transport loop employed by in-core thermionic reactor designs of the past. The nuclear fuel, power conversion, heat transport, and heat rejection functions are all combined into a single modular unit. The reactor/converter assembly uses UN fuel pins to obtain a critical core configuration with in-core safety rods and reflector controls added to complete the subassembly. By thermally bonding the core <b>heat</b> transfer <b>assemblies</b> during the reactor core is coupled neutronically, thermally, and electrically into a modular assembly of individual power sources with cross-tied architecture. A forward-facing <b>heat</b> pipe radiator <b>assembly</b> extends from the reactor head {{in the shape of}} a frustum of a cone on the opposite side of the power system from the payload. Important virtues of the concept are the absence of any single-point failures and the ability of the core to effectively transfer the TFE waste heat load laterally to other in-core <b>heat</b> transfer <b>assemblies</b> in the event of multiple failures in either in-core and radiator heat pipes...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a practical method for calculating the heat transfer during Vapour Phase Soldering (VPS) process. VPS is a reflow soldering method based on condensation heating {{and used in}} the electronics manufacturing. The presented explicit model describes solutions for filmwise condensation heat transfer based on the Nusselt theory. Different approaches on describing the filmwise condensation were investigated, compared and modified {{in order to determine}} a proper heat transfer coefficient for the VPS process - where the <b>heated</b> <b>assembly</b> can be considered as a horizontal plate. For the verification, measurements were done in an experimental soldering oven. The results of the calculations show a proper approximation with the measured temperature data.

40|$|Satellite {{propulsion}} systems are typically complex and costly, and require extensive {{ground support equipment}} and personnel to implement. While these systems may be feasible for large commercial or government programs to execute, they are impractical for micro- and nano-satellite systems. In particular, these small spacecraft cannot utilize classical hazardous or high-pressure components, as small satellites are often hosted as secondary payloads with stringent restrictions imposed. In contrast to this paradigm, an effort to develop, manufacture, and validate a low-cost propulsion system suitable for small, secondary payloads was pursued. Intended for orbit insertion, stationkeeping, and de-orbit operations, this system was developed to operate within the typical constraints of a small satellite. In addition to the aforementioned cost and safety concerns, small satellites possess limited mass, volume, and electrical power. Given these considerations, a straightforward warm gas system was chosen, with liquid butane as propellant. This configuration is not only inherently simple, but can also be manufactured using primarily off-theshelf components, which can be quickly procured in small quantities. With a fully integrated sensor manifold and <b>heating</b> <b>assembly,</b> this design provides performance well suited to a small satellite mission of several years in low- Earth orbit...|$|R
