5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Mahatma Gandhi's life {{achievement}} stands {{unique in}} political history. He has invented {{a completely new}} and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only {{be the work of}} such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy and <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Shelby Corcoran is a {{recurring}} fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. Portrayed by actress Idina Menzel, Shelby {{was introduced in}} the fourteenth episode of the show as the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Fans had lobbied for Menzel to be cast as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) biological mother, due to the strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Michele. After it is revealed that Shelby is, in fact, Rachel's biological mother, Shelby discloses that she had signed a contract that stated that she could not seek out her daughter until she was eighteen. She tells Rachel that instead of trying to act like mother and daughter, they should just be <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> they have met, and maintain their distance.|$|E

However, that night, Khaldun sneaks into Tom's bedroom at the {{university}} campus, and warns him that Rachid is keeping explosives, and a suicide attack will take place the next day, but will not disclose where. Tom turns to Parkmount's imam Fazul Azzam (Roshan Seth), who opposes Rachid's radicalised views. After learning Fazzul's daughter Aminah (Praveen Sond) is involved, he forces her into revealing {{the location of the}} planned attack. Rachid is placed under arrest when explosives are found in his prayer room. Khaldun meanwhile, kills Rachid's men in an empty building, and attempts to disarm the bomber, young Abu Hassan (Taahir Husein), but he runs away into a playground. As Tom's team and local police surround the playground, Khaldun attempts to talk Abu out of the attack. However, when he fails, Khaldun throws himself as Abu detonates the bomb, in order to avoid further casualties. Later, CIA liaison Christine Dale voices disappointment towards Khaldun's death, but appears <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> Tom is unharmed.|$|E

Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway.|$|E

The department responded to the situation by activating their crisis plan, forming 20 trauma teams.

25|$|DeBakey {{initially}} {{resisted the}} surgical option, but as his health deteriorated and DeBakey became unresponsive, the surgical team opted {{to proceed with}} surgical intervention. In a controversial decision, Houston Methodist Hospital Ethics Committee approved the operation; on February 9–10, he became the oldest patient ever to undergo the surgery {{for which he was}} responsible. The operation lasted seven hours. After a complicated post-operative course that required eight months in the hospital at a cost of over one million dollars, DeBakey was released in September 2006 and returned to good health. Although DeBakey had previously refused surgery, he later stated that he was <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> his surgical team performed the operation.|$|E

25|$|From the {{difficult}} landings at Guadalcanal and the New Georgias, Admiral Wilkinson had learned a significant lesson {{about the necessity}} of rapid unloading and getting his slow, vulnerable transports away from the landing area. To this end, he only loaded his transports half full and his cargo ships one-quarter full, and made sure that 30% of the troops on the beach assisted in unloading. The Japanese, having been taken by surprise, were unable to mount an air assault on the invasion fleet. Admiral Wilkinson, <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> his transports were able to land almost the entire troop contingent and {{a large amount of}} materiel unmolested by air attack, ordered them out of the area around sundown.|$|E
25|$|Until 1834, the Bank of England {{observed}} about 33 saints' {{days and}} religious festivals as holidays, {{but in that}} year this was reduced to four: 1 May (May Day), 1 November (All Saints' Day), Good Friday and Christmas Day. In 1871, the first legislation relating to bank holidays was passed when Liberal politician and banker Sir John Lubbock introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871, which specified the days in the table below. Under the Act, no person was compelled to make any payment or to do any act upon a bank holiday which {{he would not be}} compelled to do or make on Christmas Day or Good Friday, and the making of a payment or the doing of an act on the following day was equivalent to doing it on the holiday. People were so <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> some called the first Bank Holidays St Lubbock's Days for a while. Scotland was treated separately because of its separate traditions: for example, New Year is a more important holiday there.|$|E

500|$|Just {{days before}} the episodes were set to {{transmit}} Channel 4 {{announced that it was}} axing the storyline, due in part to Fergus's reaction to the storyline.

[...] "This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events. However, after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline." [...] Amber Hodgkiss, who was cast to play Chrissy, expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying, [...] "The storyline has been completely cut. I am not so happy about it. I would like it to go ahead, but I don't have that decision. It wasn't based on Jamie Bulger, but people portrayed it that way. It was quite a big storyline that could affect people, but it happens." [...] Fergus said she was <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> the plot was axed saying, [...] "I'm <b>grateful</b> <b>that</b> they are respecting my wishes. I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings." ...|$|E
