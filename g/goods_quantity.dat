The CISG {{does not appear to}} recognise common law unilateral contracts but, subject to clear indication by the offeror, treats any proposal not addressed to a specific person as only an invitation to make an offer. Further, where there is no explicit price or procedure to implicitly determine price, then the parties are assumed to have agreed upon a price based upon that ‘generally charged {{at the time of the}} conclusion of the contract for such goods sold under comparable circumstances’.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{incentives}} and punishments {{are the most}} common instruments to fight tax evasion. The theoretical literature disregarded indirect schemes, such as itemised deductions, in which an agent has an interest in that other agents declare their revenue. Itemised deductions provide an incentive for consumers to declare their purchases, and this forces sellers to do the same. I show that, for any level of taxation, it is possible to increase tax proceeds by choosing the proper level of itemised deduction: the cost for the government on the consumers' side is more than compensated by the extra proceeds on the sellers' side. tax evasion, itemised deductions, substitutes <b>goods,</b> <b>quantity</b> competition. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{modelling}} system to simulate goods movements at an urban scale. It allows joint analysis of choices made by end-consumers (assumed to be families) and retailers. These movements are examined at two levels: analysis of commodity flows, {{in terms of}} quantity, generated by the consumption of commodities; analysis of commodity flows, in terms of vehicles, due to restocking. The first level allows us to calculate the <b>goods</b> <b>quantity</b> flows due to consumption and restocking; the second level allows us to determine the service, vehicles used and target time, {{as well as the}} route chosen for restocking sales outlets in order to estimate vehicle flows on the urban/metropolitan transportation network.

40|$|Building an {{asymmetric}} differentiated <b>goods</b> <b>quantity</b> competition model, {{the present}} paper explores how substitutability of products, {{one of the factors}} affecting the unilateral effect, determines horizontal mergers and acquisitions equilibrium and strategies. It seems intuitively obvious that the merger between firms with goods that are sufficiently close substitutes can be more profitable. However, this thesis 2 ̆ 7 s counter-intuitive results show that, for some parameter values, a merger is more profitable for the merging firm when the target firm produces a distant substitutes (i. e., when it is not the closest competitor to the acquiring firm in the market). The theoretical analysis shows that to merge with firm with low substitute parameter is more profitable provided that target firms are close enough and the both of them are distant enough from merging firms. The results in Cournot model and Bertrand have some similarities, for example, they both harm to consumer surplus and the optimal strategy harms most. For the difference, for example, in Coumot model, whenever it is profitable to merge with a distant competitor, it is the optimal strategy, while in Bertrand model, it depends. The paper also extends the classical 2 ̆ 2 horizontal merger paradox 2 ̆ 2 to a setting of asymmetric differentiated oligopoly...|$|E

Even if this matter can be, impede the process of order stuff, if the stock being diminishes. On that score, the system is needed that can encode that data list with fixing in a data managing system. The fixes that will be doing are making with use registry system, which computerized, both in registry aspect and supply goods, the transaction registry and the other process that, connected dealt only with shop activity. 	This research made with the purposes to deliver the computerized basis system, and facilitate the employees in transaction recording. In this research is made application for a store selling agriculture using the programming language Java with NetBeans IDE and MySQL. 	Thesis research in order to place this in Citra Lawu agriculture tools shop that places in Mener orchard, Segorogunung village, Ngargoyoso sub district, Karanganyar regency. The development method that used in this research is SDLC system (System Development Life Cycle).

In experiments it was concluded the following applications: 1) Success to make the sales system application on java desktop basis. 2) This sales system application helps on sales transaction record in Citra Lawu Agriculture Tools Shop. 3) This system also equipped with login, and every user has an access right which, different as the position they’re have. 4) As follow the questioner data result that it got the screen design good enough, easy to use, the features is completely enough, the users quietly satisfied on operation it, and with the scoring all of this application is quiet ones...|$|E

U radu je predstavljen neuro-fuzzy model kao podrška procesu odlučivanja, koji uspešno oponaša proces odlučivanja organa saobraćajne podrške. / Logistics {{systems in}} the Serbian Armed Forces are built {{in order to ensure}} and {{maintain}} combat readiness. During combat actions the structure of logistics forces, equipment and resources is organized in order to ensure success in combats and operations. Progress in information security and transport technology makes it possible for a soldier to switch mass for speed and to be sure that everything will work well. The spectrum of a full support means the support to a soldier from the supply source to the place where it will be needed. In order to obtain appropriate systems for logistics support, the systems which meet requirements and which are adjusted in accordance with environment changes and new requests are created, notably models based on the operational research methods. The key point in the process of transport management in the Serbian Armed Forces is a decision making process. On a daily basis, the units of transport support obtain a large number of requests from other units of the Serbian Armed Forces demanding the transport of different types of load to different destinations. Each transport request is characterized with a number of attributes such as: type of <b>goods,</b> <b>quantity</b> (weight and volume), places of loading and unloading, expected time for loading and/or unloading and distance to which goods have to be transported. This paper shows a neuro-fuzzy model as a support to the decision making process. This model successfully imitates the decision making process of the transport support officers. As a result of the research, it is shown that the suggested adaptable fuzzy system, which has ability to learn, has a possibility to imitate the decision making process of transport support officers and to show the level of competence comparable with the level of their competence...|$|E

Based on the result of work evaluation of Pharmaceutical Supply Inventory for tablet supply in Pharmaceutical Installation Storage Room at PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital Unit I, {{it was found that}} unsuitability between <b>goods</b> <b>quantity</b> with stock card and computerization was as much as 15, 38 %, TOR value was 29 times every year, final sock value was 6 %, medicine percentage was ED (expired date) 0, 03 %. This data showed us that the suitability between goods and stock care, medicine ED percentage, TOR, and final stock value didnt meet the hospital target yet. Method: This research was a kind of qualitative description with a draft as observational research. The subjects at this research were The Head of Pharmaceutical Installation, The Head of Pharmaceutical Installation Storage Room, officers of Pharmaceutical Installation Storage Room, and The Head of Maintenance Unit. The means of the research used observatory method and a deep interview. Data analysis was made in a way of qualitative description, and triangulation technique was done to guarantee data validity. Results: Based on the result of research by using observation and deep interview, we knew that medicine storage system in Pharmaceutical Installation Storage Room didnt meet the standard because the medicine arrangement didnt refer to therapy class/ medicine merit. The building and the rooms were suitable with the standard, but the equipments didnt meet the standard because there was no alarm, gram and milligram measurement, box opener, and maintenance card.
