40|$|The 1992 - 95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina created deep ethnic {{divisions}} in alreadyfragmented university structures, where individual faculties possessed considerable academic and financial independence. The faculties, in turn, in the Humboldtian tradition, were composed of semi-autonomous "chairs" and institutes. This {{level of the}} organisation had gained added autonomy in the Communist period from the distinctive Yugoslav "self-management" principle, intended to empower operating units. This fragmentation at institutional level is compounded in present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina {{by the absence of}} any effective national-level planning and control of higher education. Post-war reform efforts by international agencies have addressed some of the problems of this fragmented structure. But they have not taken sufficient account {{of the differences between the}} academic principles on which the universities of Bosnia-Herzegovina are founded and those of the Anglo-American tradition, from which models of managerial reform are typically taken. Through a better understanding of the universities’ long-established organisational frameworks, it may be possible for aid projects to help achieve enhanced <b>institutional</b> managerial <b>effectiveness</b> and to reverse some of the more damaging effects of multi-level fragmentation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses an {{institutional}} perspective {{to examine the}} changing monetary policy operations in China since the 1978 reform.

Under the constraint of exchange rate stability and other <b>institutional</b> factors, the <b>effectiveness</b> of these indirect tools is limited. Establishing an interbank money market policy rate through SHIBOR will provide a means of signaling the cost of funds to banks and the public.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims {{to examine}} the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the European Union foreign policy in terms of the EU's institutional architecture. It explores how the Lisbon reform responds to the previous weaknesses of the EU foreign policy mechanisms and what is its potential for the future of this special dimension of the European integration. The paper studies the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on three main areas - coherence, effectiveness and visibility of the EU foreign policy. It concludes that the innovations introduced by the reform treaty, led by the enhanced function of the High Representative, are correctly aiming at the previous causes of incoherence. At the same time, however, they produce a risk of new inter- <b>institutional</b> conflicts. <b>Effectiveness</b> remains a problematic issue. The external action is limited by the rigid decision-making process. Although the High Representative is not a single voice of the Union on the international scene, the Lisbon Treaty significantly improves the representation of the EU. However, this may be counter-productive in case of incoherent and inefficient foreign policy formulation process. Since many provisions of the treaty related to foreign policy are vague, the question remains whether the Member States will decide to take advantage of its [...] ...|$|R

This research study aims to establish how formal <b>institutional</b> policies’ <b>effectiveness</b> may be hindered by cultural norms inherent in the way women are treated by society, as well as in how they perceive themselves. The aim is to identify and highlight reasons for the lack of effective female entrepreneurship, with the aim of achieving high-impact entrepreneurship by women in South Africa with a view to growing the economy.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study of Australian {{teaching}} and learning centres to identify {{factors that contribute to}} their effective strategic leadership. These centres remain in a state of flux, with seemingly endless reconfiguration. The drivers for such change appear to lie in decision makers’ search for their centres to add more strategic value to organisational teaching, learning and the student experience. Through a synthesis of findings based on interviews, a survey of directors of centres and focus groups, the article identifies paradigmatic shifts in the ways centres see themselves, relate to their organisations and respond to external environmental forces. From an understanding of paradigm shifts, strategic contributions to academic development in the sector are framed organisationally through key points of leverage. Points of leverage are manageable actions that can be taken to maximise overall <b>institutional</b> impact and <b>effectiveness.</b> <br /...|$|R

Then he proceeds to <b>institutional</b> aspects of <b>effectiveness</b> of the state considering it as a specific organization and system of institutions of power and control; defines components of effectiveness of the state generalizing the existing methodological approaches and most importantly — the modern criteria for assessing the effectiveness of the state...|$|R

Taiwanese direct investment in southern China represents a case where transnational capital flows are shaped by cultural and <b>institutional</b> conditions. The <b>effectiveness</b> of Taiwanese direct investment in southern China is achieved through the interpersonal networks established between Taiwanese investors and local Chinese officials. Such networks, in turn, are based on two major conditions. First, the newly gained economic autonomy of local governments in southern China, {{as well as the}} Chinese bureaucratic tradition of flexible interpretation and implementation of laws. Such an institutional context provided the space for the local state in China to bypass the scrutiny of the central state and to link up with the world economy directly through overseas Chinese capitals. Second, cultural and linguistic affinity between the Taiwanese investors and local Chinese officials have provided the tools for establishing interpersonal networks between Taiwanese investors and Chinese local officials through the principle of gift exchange. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{compares the}} Post Keynesian and North’s {{approaches}} {{to an analysis}} of uncertainty and uncertainty-reducing role of institutions. Author emphasizes that Post Keynesianism was the first school of economic thought that has made uncertainty the starting point of own research program. Many of North’s line of reasoning about uncertainty were mentioned by the Post Keynesians long before his works had been published. It is not fortuitous that in the course of discussion of ergodicity and non-ergodicity North cites Davidson, leader of Post Keynesianism. Both approaches conclude that Neoclassical theory cannot be applicable to the solution of the real world’s problem because it ignores “genuine” (fundamental) uncertainty. The paper considers also differences between these two approaches. Whereas North’s theory explains inability of many systems to grow steadily, the Post Keynesians emphasize problems of systems perceived as successful. These problems exist due the fact that <b>institutional</b> evolution decreases <b>effectiveness</b> of uncertainty’s reduction and are revealed in macroeconomic and financial crises...|$|R
