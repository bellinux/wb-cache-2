25|$|Jazani, after {{release from}} prison with all his power began the {{development}} and organization of his movement. In spring of 1966, Hassan Zia-Zarifi was added to group and with his recommendation united the organization with the Razm Avaran organization. Razm Avaran was organized by Abbass Sourky in 1959 and its members {{in the years before}} 1953 were members of the Tudeh party and until February 15, 1960, when for promotion and circulation of the party in universities were arrested supported the ideologies of the Tudeh party. But in 1964, when Sourky again organized Razm Avaran, not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> want to associate with the Tudeh party but supported the ideology of the Communist Party of China. The recommendation of Hassan Zia-Zarifi, due to the characteristics of Sourky such as inexperience, crowded work, and his past affiliations that led to him being arrested, caused the central authority of the group to be uninterested with this prospect. But, due to internal problems such as impatience of members of the long process of development, which showed when Keyoumars Ezadi left the group, led to the decision to negotiations between the two groups. Even though in the negotiations between Jazani, Zarifi, and Saeed Kalantari Nazari by Sourky and Zarar Zahedian there were major uncertainty to Sourky had been developed by Jazani; the prospect of adding 120 ready members and a large number of explosives and artillery finally led to the merger of the Razm Avaran group with the Jazani group in fall 1966.|$|E
500|$|A receipt {{found among}} Sibelius's papers {{refers to a}} [...] "Symphonie" [...] being bound by the firm of Weilin & Göös in August 1938. While it is not {{established}} that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out {{that none of the}} earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading [...] "Symphonie", and asks: [...] "Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? Or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. [...] "He wanted it to be better than the other symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. In the end I don't know whether he would have accepted what he had written." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if he needed {{to do it in the}} framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> get back to have a hand in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get from one end of the ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Republican {{victory in the}} 2012 Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, Romney criticized Obama's {{stimulus}} policy, saying that Obama [...] "wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more fireman, more policeman, more teachers. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's {{time for us to}} cut back on government and help the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anquetil took a forthright and {{controversial}} {{stand on the}} use of performance-enhancing drugs. He never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux–Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through [...] "the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said in a television interview, before adding: [...] "Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope." [...] There was implied acceptance of doping right {{to the top of the}} state: the president, Charles de Gaulle, said of Anquetil: [...] "Doping? What doping? Did he or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> make them play the Marseillaise [...] abroad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{then stood}} {{silent for a}} moment, having {{finished}} that task; but yet <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sit down.

2500|$|Colonel Hinkle rode to {{the church}} leaders in Far West and {{informed}} them of the offered terms. [...] According to Latter Day Saint witness Reed Peck, when Smith {{was told that the}} Mormons would be expected to leave the state, he replied that [...] "he did not care" [...] and that he would be glad {{to get out of the}} [...] "damnable state" [...] anyway. Smith and the other leaders rode with Hinkle back to the Missouri militia encampment. [...] The militia promptly arrested Smith and the other leaders. [...] Smith believed that Hinkle had betrayed him, but Hinkle maintained his innocence and claimed that he was following Smith's orders. [...] To William Wines Phelps, a fellow Latter-day Saint and witness to the events, Hinkle wrote: [...] "When the facts were laid before Joseph, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> say, 'I will go'; and did not the others go with him, and that, too, voluntarily, so far as you and I were concerned?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Heaven {{had already}} favored someone else, and his chance was over. [...] He {{was at least}} more {{fortunate}} than Chen She. [...] He {{was the first to}} rise in rebellion but was finally willing to surrender to others. [...] <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> know that this put him in great danger? [...] Further, he could not actually submit, contributing his abilities to serve the emperor, and he finally rebelled, becoming only a madman. [...] He did not accept Wang Bodang's words, and he finally suffered disaster at Taolin. [...] Some have compared him to Xiang Yu. [...] Even if he had sufficient civil and military abilities to match, he was far more lacking in bravery and decisiveness. [...] If Yang Su had favored Li Mi's abilities, he should have let Li Mi be a servant of the emperor, but instead he gave Li Mi to his idiotic son , finally leading to the slaughter of his house. [...] How was that appropriate? ...|$|E
2500|$|Seinfeld co-creator Larry David based George {{largely on}} himself. Seinfeld and David created the {{character}} as a counterpoint to Seinfeld's character. In {{the first draft}} of the show's pilot script, called [...] "Stand-Up" [...] at the time, George's name was Bennett and he, like Jerry, was a comedian. In that same draft, the scene in the pilot in which George and Jerry discuss a woman Jerry met earlier, saw George and Jerry discussing their stand-up act. This idea however, was quickly abandoned and his name was changed to George, the real estate broker instead. George's last name comes from Michael Costanza, a college classmate of Seinfeld. [...] "Louis", George's middle name is a homage to Lou Costello, whose 1950s television series The Abbott and Costello Show, inspired Seinfelds writing style. Although he is often asked whether he wanted to play the character, Larry David has said that he was only interested in writing the show, that, not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> want to act on the show, but {{it had never occurred to}} him and, even if it had, he highly doubted that NBC would have approved of his being cast.|$|E

2500|$|The Marquis himself owed {{his life}} to the {{courtesy}} with which he had formerly treated Colonel Hammond, who had been his prisoner for a few days. Hammond now in turn protected his former captor, though he could not prevent the soldiers from stripping the old man of his costly attire. After this {{the lord of the}} devastated mansion was safe from all but [...] one form of insult. Consideration for fallen greatness never entered into the thoughts of a Puritan controversialist, even when that controversialist was of as kindly a disposition as was Hugh Peters. A Catholic, too, was beyond all bounds of religious courtesy, and Peters thought it well (as Cheynell had thought it well {{in the presence of the}} dying Chillingworth), to enter into argument with the fallen Marquis. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> now see, he asked him, the hopelessness of the cause which he had maintained? [...] "If the King", was the proud reply, [...] "had no more ground in England but Basing House, I would adventure as I did, and so maintain it to the uttermost. Basing House is called Loyalty". On the larger merits of the Royal cause he refused to enter. [...] "I hope", he simply said, [...] "that the King may have a day again".|$|E
