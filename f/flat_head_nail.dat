50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full <b>head</b> <b>nail</b> guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped <b>head</b> so the <b>nails</b> can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round <b>Head</b> <b>nails</b> and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of 2 stroke engine scavenging in two cases. One with an existing condition (<b>Flat</b> <b>headed</b> pistons) and another with a new design (Dome headed piston). The numerical analysis is done with help of CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5. Here, the modeling of engine piston with <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> type and with dome headed types was done in workbench. In ANSYS FLUENT after the geometrical design, for the dynamic motion meshing is used and set up species transport model also. At first the scavenging effect of <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> piston is analyzed. Later the simulation of piston with dome headed type was also checked. Analyzing the variations from each and selected the best method for scavenging. Finally the scavenging efficiency is calculated for both type arrangements...|$|R

5000|$|The largest {{sizes of}} {{conventional}} collated fastenings are the clipped head and full <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> {{which are used}} in framing, fencing {{and other forms of}} structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a shank diameter of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to [...] in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20째 to 21째 for full head, 28째 to 34째 for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.|$|R
