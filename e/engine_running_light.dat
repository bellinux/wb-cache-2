50|$|The fireman of {{the coal}} train {{similarly}} laid detonators on the down line just inside the Abbots Ripton down distant signal, and was then {{picked up by the}} coal train <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> <b>light</b> to Huntingdon to seek assistance and warn approaching down trains. This was at the instigation of a GNR “relief clerk” (i.e. a clerk qualified to act as a ‘’locum’’ stationmaster) who had been travelling on the express.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, {{while he}} was walking along the B&O {{railroad}} tracks, an <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> without its <b>lights</b> struck down Kane, severing his left leg 5 inches below the knee. He was fitted with an artificial limb, and his disability landed him a new job with the B&O as a watchman. He was a watchman for eight years.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} of the expanded steam is {{less than that of}} steam supplied directly from the boiler. An engine working with an expansion valve set to an early cut-off is thus less powerful than with the valve fully open. Accordingly, the engine must now be driven, so that the valve is manually adjusted as the load on the engine changes. An <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> under <b>light</b> load may be operated efficiently with an early cut-off, an engine under heavy load may require a longer cut-off and the cost of more steam consumption.|$|R
50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic windscreen wipers on cars up until around 1960. These used the manifold vacuum of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn oscillating vane actuator. Such windscreen wipers worked adequately when the <b>engine</b> was <b>running</b> under <b>light</b> load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the manifold vacuum was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|R
40|$|Factors {{that may}} make a {{structure}} too dangerous to protect: If you answer, “yes ” {{to any of the}} below, don’t attempt to protect that structure, move on to the next. Fire is making a sustained run and {{there is little or no}} clearance. Water supply will not last as long as the threat. Fire’s intensity dictates leaving the area immediately. The roof is more than one-quarter involved. There is fire inside the structure or windows are broken. If the conditions listed above allow for a structure protection effort to be made then: • Check roads before the fire arrives. Know turnouts, and bridge limits. • Check each home for an adequate defendable space. • Stay mobile; keep vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> and red <b>lights</b> on. • Back in equipment for a quick escape. • Brief resources on strategies, tactics, hazards, and LCES. ...|$|R

In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, capable of running on gasoline or E85.|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} the {{promising}} renewable, alternative and environmentally friendly biofuels {{that can be used in}} diesel engine with little or no modification in the engine. In the present study an experimental investigation has been carried out on the combustion and performance characteristics of a CI <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with biodiesel under steady state operating conditions. The experimental work has been conducted on a four-cylinder, four -stroke, direct injection (DI) and turbocharged diesel engine. In this investigation, biodiesel (produced from the waste oil by transesterfication process) and normal diesel have been used. During the experiment the in-cylinder pressure and the specific fuel consumption were measured. The experimental results of this study can be summarised as follows. The tests on <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with different fuels (biodiesel and diesel) have resulted almost overlapped P-V diagrams. The power outputs at 1300 rpm and 105, 210, 315 Nm and 420 loads of the diesel and biodiesel are almost the same. The <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with biodiesel has produced slightly higher in-cylinder pressure and peak heat release rate than the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with normal diesel at all operating conditions. Furthermore, the brake specific fuel consumption values for the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with biodiesel are higher than the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with normal diesel by a maximum of 14...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} the {{alternative}} fuels which is renewable and environmentally friendly and can be used in diesel engines with little or no modifications. In the present study, experimental investigations were carried out on the effects of biodiesel types, biodiesel fraction and physical properties on the combustion and performance characteristics of a compression ignition (CI) engine. The experimental work was conducted on a four-cylinder, four -stroke, direct injection (DI) and turbocharged diesel engine by using biodiesel of waste oil, rapeseed oil and corn oil and normal diesel. Based on the measured parameters, detailed analyses were carried out on cylinder pressure, heat release rate and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). It has been seen that the biodiesel types do not result in any significant differences in peak cylinder pressure and BSFC. The results also clearly indicate that the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with biodiesel have slightly higher in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate than the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with normal diesel. The BSFC for the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with neat biodiesel was higher than the <b>engine</b> <b>running</b> with normal diesel by up to 15 %. It is also noticed that the physical properties of the biodiesel affects significantly the performance of the engine...|$|R
40|$|Daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> {{increase}} visual {{contrast between}} vehicles and their background, improving their noticeability and detectability. Seven countries require motor vehicles to have lights on during all daytime periods [...] Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Studies from {{these and other}} countries have generally indicated that daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> use is associated with small to moderate reductions in multiple-vehicle daytime crashes, especially those involving vehicles approaching from the front or side. There is evidence also that initial positive effects of daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not dissipate over time, that is, there is little support for novelty or habituation effects. The bulk of {{the evidence suggests that}} <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not lead to increases in collisions involving pedestrians and pedalcyclists, allaying concerns that there would be negative consequences of making these road users relatively less conspicuous. Most of the studies have been conducted in countries located at latitudes that are to the north of most of the continental United States and that have longer twilight periods and generally lower ambient illumination. The concern has been expressed that <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> may lose their effectiveness in countries located at lower latitudes, such as the United States, because the lights will provide less of a contrast. General Motors Corporation and some other manufacturers are now providing <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> on new models with higher intensities than are used in Scandinavian countries. Findings in <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> studies suggest that their effect in the United States will be positive, and their introduction provides an opportunity to determine the effect. The costs of <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> are low, so even modest crash reductions would be cost effective...|$|R
