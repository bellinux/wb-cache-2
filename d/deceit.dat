5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for <b>deceit.</b> The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed <b>deceit,</b> and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the ability to recognize mistakes and <b>deceits</b> in communicative interactions. Our assumptions are that (1) {{on the basis of the}} mental representations involved it is possible to predict difference in difficulty of recognition for mistakes and <b>deceits,</b> and (2) on the basis of the inferential load involved it is possible to predict difference in difficulty of recognition for simple and complexmistakes, as well as for simple and complex <b>deceits.</b> Furthermore, we improved our account of the ability to recognize mistakes and <b>deceits</b> by presenting several assumptions concerning this ability’s relation with mindreading, attention capacity, andverbal span. As failures in recognition ofmistakes anddeceits aremore likely to occur in young children,wevalidated our predictionswith one experiment on 300 children aged 4 – 11 years. The results of the experiment confirmed all the predictions except that concerning simple <b>deceits</b> versus complex <b>deceits.</b> Indeed, children tend to recognize complex <b>deceits</b> more easily than simple <b>deceits.</b> We interpret this result in terms of the complexity of themental representations and processes involved in communicative interactions as a cue for suspicion and for searching for possible deceitful intentions of the speaker...|$|R

5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, {{sleight of hand}} is also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and <b>deceit</b> at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|As {{a longer}} term and more {{significant}} development, the Bill of Middlesex {{was one of}} several revolutionary developments by the King's Bench met with a conservative reaction from the Common Pleas, fearful of losing its own caseload. The troubles during this period are best illustrated by Slade's Case. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for <b>deceit.</b> The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed <b>deceit,</b> and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts. In Slade's Case, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, John Popham, deliberately provoked the Common Pleas into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King's Bench could vote, allowing them to overrule the Common Pleas and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action. After the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary Common Pleas.|$|E

Meanwhile, the late king Robert Baratheon's estranged brother Stannis (Stephen Dillane) emerges as yet another claimant to the throne.

5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, <b>deceit,</b> and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but <b>deceit.</b> Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1567, in a swoop {{known as}} the Surprise of Meaux, Huguenot forces {{attempted}} to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war. Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray. The war was ended by the Peace of Longjumeau of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued. The Surprise of Meaux marked {{a turning point in}} Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots. From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression. She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was <b>deceit,</b> and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where Calvinists and rebels were put to death in the thousands.|$|E
5|$|Poppaea now plans some <b>deceit</b> of her own, in {{an effort}} to divert Claudius's wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled.

Then Claudius enters; Poppaea tells him that he had earlier misunderstood her: it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius. To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea. Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero. After Claudius departs, Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias.|$|E

Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged <b>deceit</b> by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
