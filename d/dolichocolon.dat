50|$|<b>Dolichocolon</b> is a genus {{of flies}} in the family Tachinidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dolichocolon</b> {{is often}} an {{incidental}} finding on abdominal X-rays or colonoscopy. It is not by itself a disease and as such requires no treatment.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, a <b>dolichocolon</b> (word {{derived from}} ancient Greek dolichos, the long {{distance}} in running, and colon) is an abnormally long large intestine. It {{should not be}} confused with an abnormally wide large intestine, which is called a megacolon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dolichocolon</b> may {{predispose}} to abnormal rotation (see volvulus) and interposition {{between the}} diaphragm and the liver (see Chilaiditi syndrome). It is more commonly {{seen in the}} elderly, some psychiatric patients or in institutionalised individuals. It is not, however, a part of normal aging. The exact cause remains unknown.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{cause is}} not always known, but it may occur in {{patients}} with a long and mobile colon (<b>dolichocolon),</b> chronic lung disease such as emphysema, or liver problems such as cirrhosis and ascites. Chilaiditi's sign is generally not associated with symptoms, and is most commonly an incidental finding in normal individuals.|$|E
40|$|The Palaeotropical goniine genus <b>Dolichocolon</b> Brauer & Bergenstamm is {{revised and}} {{analysed}} cladistically. Seventeen new species are described from Australia (Queensland, Northern Territory), Cameroon, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Senegal, Thailand, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. The following new synonymy is proposed after direct comparison of primary types: <b>Dolichocolon</b> klapperichi Mesnil, 1967 = <b>Dolichocolon</b> orientale Townsend, 1927 syn. nov. A {{key to the}} 21 known species is presented. A cladistic analysis based on 36 morphological characters provides support for the monophyly of <b>Dolichocolon.</b> A sister-group relationship is indicated between <b>Dolichocolon</b> and Kuwanimyia Townsend, whereas <b>Dolichocolon</b> chiangmaiensis sp. nov. from Thailand takes a position as sister group to all other <b>Dolichocolon</b> species.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of the genomic deletion of exon 3 of the GH receptor (d 3 GHR) on long-term clinical outcome of acromegaly in a well-characterized cohort of patients with long-term remission of acromegaly. We conducted a cross-sectional study. The presence of the d 3 GHR polymorphism was assessed in 86 acromegalic patients with long-term disease control and related to anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, osteoarthritis, bone mineral density, colonic polyps and diverticulae, and <b>dolichocolon.</b> Fifty-one patients had two wild-type alleles (59 %), whereas 29 patients (34 %) had one allele and six patients (7 %) had two alleles encoding for the d 3 GHR isoform. Carriers of the d 3 GHR isoform showed increased prevalence of osteoarthritis, especially of the hip [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 5. 2; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 3. 2 - 7. 1], of adenomatous polyps (adjusted OR, 4. 1; 95 % CI, 2. 4 - 5. 6), and <b>dolichocolon</b> (adjusted OR, 3. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 8 - 4. 6). Anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineral density, and (non) vertebral fractures were not significantly different between patients with and without the d 3 GHR allele. In patients with long-term cured acromegaly, the d 3 GHR polymorphism is associated with an increased prevalence of irreversible comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, <b>dolichocolon,</b> and adenomatous colonic polyps, but not with other comorbidities such as cardiovascular risk factor...|$|E
40|$|In acromegaly, {{overproduction}} of GH and IGF-I causes abnormal {{extracellular matrix}} regulation. We hypothesized {{that this may}} predispose {{to the development of}} colonic diverticula. Because the relation between acromegaly and colonic diverticula is unknown, the study aim was to assess the prevalence of colonic diverticula in patients with cured acromegaly. This was a case-control study. We screened reports of colonoscopies performed for the purpose of screening for polyps in 107 patients with cured or biochemically controlled acromegaly and in 214 age- and sex-matched controls for the presence of diverticula, <b>dolichocolon,</b> and polyps. In patients, the findings were related to GH/IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly and to the duration of GH/IGF-I excess. In acromegaly, colonic diverticula were present in 37 % of patients, <b>dolichocolon</b> in 34 %, and adenomatous polyps in 34 %, which was increased compared with controls (odds ratio 3. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4, 5. 7; 12. 4, 95 % confidence interval 6. 8, 18. 0; 4. 1, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9, 6. 4, respectively). The presence of colonic diverticula was associated with both GH and IGF-I concentrations at the time of diagnosis of acromegaly, when adjusted for the duration of active disease. The presence of <b>dolichocolon</b> and adenomatous polyps was associated with higher IGF-I concentrations at diagnosis. Acromegaly is associated with an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Since 1970, {{lengthening}} of the rectosigmoid {{has been}} suspected to be a solitary manifestation of Chagas colopathy. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, opaque enema was administered on 210 seropositive and 63 seronegative patients, and radiographs in the anteroposterior and posteroanterior positions were examined {{blind to the}} serological and clinical findings. The distal colon was measured using a flexible ruler along the central axis of the image from the anus to the iliac crest. RESULTS: <b>Dolichocolon</b> was diagnosed in 31 (14. 8 %) seropositive and 3 (4. 8 %) seronegative patients. The mean length was 57. 2 (± 12. 2) cm in seropositive patients and 52. 1 (± 8. 8) cm in the seronegative patients (p = 0. 000), that is, the distal colon in Chagas patients was, on average, 5. 1 cm longer. Seropositive female patients presented a mean length of 58. 8 (± 12. 3) cm, and seronegative female patients presented 53. 2 (± 9. 1) cm (p = 0. 002). Seropositive male patients had a mean length of 55 (± 11. 6) cm, and seronegative male patients had 49. 9 (± 7. 8) cm (p = 0. 02). Among 191 patients without megacolon and suspected megacolon, the mean length was 56. 3 (± 11. 6) cm in seropositive individuals and 52 (± 8. 8) cm in seronegative patients (p = 0. 003). Among individuals with distal colon > 70 cm, there were 31 Chagas patients with mean length of 77. 9 (± 7. 1) cm and three seronegative with 71. 3 (± 1. 1) cm (p = 0. 000). Among 179 with distal colon < 70 cm, seropositive individuals had a mean length of 53. 6 (± 8. 8) cm, and seronegative patients had 51. 2 (± 7. 8) cm (p = 0. 059). Serological positive women had longer distal colon than men (p = 0. 02), whereas the mean length were the same among seronegative individuals (p = 0. 16).

40|$|Hypermobility type Ehlers Danlos {{syndrome}} (HT-EDS) is {{a relatively}} frequent, although commonly misdiagnosed variant of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, mainly characterized by marked joint instability and mild cutaneous involvement. Chronic pain, asthenia, and gastrointestinal and pelvic dysfunction are characteristic additional manifestations. We report on 21 HT-EDS patients selected {{from a group of}} 40 subjects with suspected mild hereditary connective tissue disorder. General, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, urogynecological, and ear nose throat abnormalities are investigated systematically and tabulated. Six distinct clinical presentations of HT-EDS are outlined, whose tabulation is a mnemonic for the practicing clinical geneticist in an attempt to diagnose this condition accurately. With detailed clinical records and phenotype comparison among patients of different ages, the natural history of the disorder is defined. Three phases (namely, hypermobility, pain, and stiffness) are delineated based on distinguishing manifestations. A constellation of additional, apparently uncommon abnormalities is also identified, including <b>dolichocolon,</b> dysphonia, and Arnold Chiari type I malformation. Their further investigation may contribute {{to an understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the protean manifestations of HT-EDS, and a more effective approach to the evaluation and management of affected individuals.

40|$|Introduction Among {{the factors}} predispositing to {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) therearegeneticHLA-DRBI, HLA-DR 3, HLA-DQ 2, inherent anomalies of colon, and acquired colon disbac-teriosis, chronic intoxication, immune changes(1, 4, 6). The inherent connective tissue displasia (CTD) with pe-culiarities of collagen synthesis secure certain place among them. CTD {{can not only}} play the certain role in pa-thogenesis of colon diseases, but also in many respects determine features of this current pathology (5). The frequency of CTD signs in patients with colon pathology is not investigated. Aim of the study The aim {{of this research was}} revealing frequency of CTD signs in patients with a colon pathology and study of clinical features and current UC, colonic flora and slime production in these patients. Material and methods 92 patients with UC and 260 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were examined in the period of clinical remission. The age of patients was from 12 till 18 years. Besidesthe standard clinical examination in all patients colon endoscopy with biopsy and hystological study, słomach endoscopy, roentgenological examination of colon, ultrasound examination of abdominal cavity were carried out. In all patients presence of CTD signs were studied such as: asthenic constitution, skeleton deformation, hypermobility of joints, hyperelasticity of a skin, myopia, presence of hernias and varicosity, sphincteric insufficiency, diverticuls, <b>dolichocolon,</b> doli-chosygma, megarectum, splanchnoptosis, colonoptosis hemorrhoid presense etc. In all patients qualitative and quantitative contents of colonic flora along with studying obligate and facultative flora were analysed. Bioptate of colon mucosa was subject to colouring by hemotoxilin-eozin and diagnosis of UC was madę hysto-logicaly. To characterise mucus production lectin histo-chemistry tests with the use of peroxidase-marked lectins were done. The following lectins were used: WGAaffini-tyto NANA, PNAaffinityto b-DGal, LALaffinitytoa-LFuc, ML- 1 affinity to a-DGal, SBAaffinity to a-DGalNAc, LCA affinitytoa-DMan, HPAaffinitytoa-GIcNAc. Different lec-tines allow histochemicaly to determine quantity of spe-cific receptors, which is generically predetermined and provides microflora adhesia on a colon surface, as the membranę of sum obligate microorganisms contains lec-tines with affinity to these receptors. Results and discussion Among the patients with IBS the CTD signs were ob-served in 138 (53. 1 %) patients. 86 patients (33. 8 %) with less than three DST signs prevailed. Most frequently the deformations of a backbone, hyper-and depigments ma-cules on a skin, short bridle of tongue, asthenic constitution, hypermobility of local and generał joints were found in these patients. In the UC patients CTD were found in 68 patients (94. 4 %). Thus, 3 and morę CTD signs were observed in 67 patients (72. 8 %) with UC and 50 patients (19. 2 %) with IBS (p&#x 003 C; 0. 01). The quantity of CTD signs correlated with severity and form of UC. Among 70 patients with distal and left-side UC five and morę external CTD signs were found in 24 patients (34. 2 %), whereas among 23 patients with total UC 5 and morę CTD signs were observed in 20 patients (86. 9 %) (p&#x 003 C; 0. 05). During endoscopic investigation of colon (rectosyg-moscopy, colonoscopy) and X-ray examinations in patients the CTD signs of colon were determined. This signs were found in 127 patients (48. 8 %) with IBS and 78 patients (84. 7 %) with UC (p&#x 003 C; 0. 05). The following CTD signs were observed: insufficiency ofsphincter, colon diverticules, <b>dolichocolon,</b> dolichosigma, megarectum, coloptosis and hemorrhoidis...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{observed}} {{case of a}} young man who suffered of large and unsuspected left bowel ischemia following an elective right open hernioplasty. A 54 -year-old man had a 2 -year history of right inguinal reducible mass and was admitted to hospital for an elective day case open inguinal hernioplasty for a direct right inguinal hernia. Apart from mild hypertension controlled with ACE inhibitor, he was medically fit and well. The patient was submitted to open tension-free mesh repair with polypropylene preshaped mesh with local infiltration anesthesia and additive sedation with midazolam. The local anesthesia and surgery were uneventful and he was discharged home on the same day as per day case protocol. He was readmitted about 12 h after discharge with a history of central and left lower abdominal pain with palpable mass, and distension and fever (38 °C). After imaging and laboratory studies the patient was submitted to explorative surgery with the suspicion of left colonic ischemia. After intraoperative confirmation we performed standard left hemicolectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful; the patient was discharged in good general condition on the 7 th postoperative day. Actually, the patient is in follow-up, with normal coagulation and hemochromocytometric pattern, asymptomatic for hypercholesterolemia and atrial flutter/fibrillation. Complications relating to bowel during open techniques of hernia repair are limited to two situations: the freeing of an incarcerated or strangulated segment of bowel and inadvertent laceration of large bowel {{in the presence of a}} sliding hernia. Following this strange case of colonic ischemia, a boolean Medline search (terms: hernia, complication, repair, groin, herniorrhaphy, hernioplasty, all major MESH subjects without language restriction) revealed no previous similar cases reported. However, to our knowledge, there is another trouble hypothesis: not causality but casualty. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of large left bowel ischemia following right open hernioplasty. We can conclude that the presence of a <b>dolichocolon</b> is an added risk factor for this rare and uneventful complication, but further investigations and case reports are necessary to estabilish the real causality...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and roentgenological {{studies of}} lymph follicles of the {{terminal}} ileum were carried out in children. The results are summarized as follows : 1. Observations made in 52 normal, healthy children have revealed that lymph follicles are well developed in 5 to 8 years, that they begin to decrease in number and size in about 11 years, {{and that they are}} nearly completely degenerated in puberty. 2. Of 20 children with enlarged tonsils, 11 had larger numbers of lymph follicles of the ileum than normal. Roentgenograms revealed a marked increase in the number and size of lymph follicles in the terminal ileum of children whose tonsils were shown to contain markedly large numbers of lymph follicles on histologic examination. 3. Examinations of 8 children with dysentery showed a marked increase in the number and size of lymph follicles {{of the terminal}} ileum. 4. Of 10 children with acute nephritis concurrent with tonsillitis or impetigo, 5 showed {{an increase in the number}} and size of lymph follicles on roentgenographic examination. 5. Of children showing organic changes in the gastrointestinal tract, those with cecum mobile, ascariasis, tuberculosis of the intestines or <b>dolichocolon</b> mobile were shown to be associated with an increase in the number and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum. 6. Of 80 children with recurrent colic pains in the umbilicus, 14 were attended with a marked increase in the number and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum, tenderness and hardening of the loop of the terminal ileum and disturbed peristalsis. It was shown that colic pains in the umbilicus were attributable to this condition. 7. There were 12 children who, having been operated on for possible acute or chronic appendicitis, proved on roentgenographic examination to be the cases of an increase in the number and size of lymph follicles of the terminal ileum. 8. Conservative treatment consisting in rest, regulation of the diet, application of poultice to the ileocecal region and administration of sulfamine and some adequate remedy for intestinal disturbances had effect on the condition resulting from an increase in the number and size of lymph follicles in the terminal ileum...|$|E
