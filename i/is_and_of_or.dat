About 250,000 people travelled across the Atlantic primarily to seek economic betterment and to escape hardships <b>and</b> famine. Most <b>of</b> these came from the borderlands <b>of</b> northern Britain <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>of</b> Scots-Irish <b>or</b> Scottish descent. Many <b>were</b> poor <b>and</b> therefore accustomed to hard times, setting them apart from the other major British immigrant groups.

50|$|Condensers and {{activated}} carbon {{may also be}} used to treat the offgas from thermal screw systems. Condensers may be either water-cooled or electrically cooled systems to decrease offgas temperatures to 100 °F to 140 °F. The efficiency of condensers for removing organic compounds ranges from 50% to greater than 95%. Noncondensible gases exiting the condenser are normally treated by a vapor-phase {{activated carbon}} treatment system. The efficiency of activated carbon adsorption systems for removing organic contaminants ranges from 50% to 99%. Condensate from the condenser is processed through a phase separator where the non-aqueous phase organic component <b>is</b> separated <b>and</b> disposed <b>of</b> <b>or</b> recycled. The remaining water is then processed through activated carbon and used to rehumidify treated soil.|$|R

2500|$|In Romanesque {{domestic}} architecture, arcades {{were most}} often supported on piers.

The number before the letters indicates the number of additional multipurpose rooms. Often the rooms are separated by removable sliding doors, fusuma, so large single rooms can be created.|$|R
50|$|Daddy Frye's Hill Cemetery {{is located}} north of {{downtown}} Methuen, on a roughly rectangular block bounded by East, Arlington, Brook, and Berkeley Streets. It covers about 2.4 acre, whose borders are lined either by a mortared stone wall, or by chain-link fencing. The terrain trends gently downhill to the south, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> dotted with trees. Most of the gravestones are oriented facing west, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> slate <b>or</b> marble.

40|$|A joint {{estimator}} {{is presented}} {{for the two}} parameters that define the long-range dependence phenomenon in the simplest case. The estimator {{is based on the}} coefficients of a discrete wavelet decomposition, improving a recently proposed wavelet-based estimator of the scaling parameter [4], as well as extending it to include the associated power parameter. An important feature <b>is</b> its conceptual <b>and</b> practical simplicity, consisting essentially in measuring the slope <b>and</b> the intercept <b>of</b> a linear fit after a discrete wavelet transform is performed, a very fast (O(n)) operation. Under well justified technical idealisations the estimator is shown to <b>be</b> unbiased <b>and</b> <b>of</b> minimum <b>or</b> close to minimum variance for the scale parameter, and asymptotically unbiased and efficient for the second parameter.

2500|$|A {{very famous}} {{ciborium}} that {{apparently did not}} stand over an altar was one that apparently functioned as a quasi-reliquary shrine or symbolic tomb for the missing remains of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Hagios Demetrios, the large and important church erected in Thessaloniki over the mass grave {{in which he was}} traditionally buried. [...] This appears, from various accounts of miracles associated with it, and depictions in mosaic, to have been a free-standing roofed structure inside the church, at one side of the nave, with doors or walls in precious metal all around it. It <b>was</b> hexagonal <b>and</b> made <b>of</b> <b>or</b> covered with silver; inside there was a couch or bed. The roof had flat triangular panels rising shallowly to a central point.

2500|$|Food was {{considered}} {{significant in the}} Joseon period. Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (Yukjo, 육조) that were charged with all matters related to procurement <b>and</b> consumption <b>of</b> food <b>and</b> drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (Ijo, 이조) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (Yejo) were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds <b>of</b> slaves <b>and</b> women {{who worked in the}} palace that had tasks such as making tofu, liquor, tea, and tteok (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>of</b> commoner <b>or</b> low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or [...] "bureau" [...] such as the bureau of special foods (Saenggwa-bang, 생과방) <b>or</b> the bureau <b>of</b> cooking foods (Soju-bang, 소주방). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.|$|R
2500|$|Cost. In 2013, the Department of Energy {{estimated}} that 80-kW automotive {{fuel cell system}} costs of [...] per kilowatt could be achieved, assuming volume production of 100,000 automotive units per year and [...] per kilowatt could be achieved, assuming volume production of 500,000 units per year. [...] Many companies are working on techniques to reduce cost {{in a variety of}} ways including reducing the amount of platinum needed in each individual cell. Ballard Power Systems has experimented with a catalyst enhanced with carbon silk, which allows a 30% reduction (1mg/cm² to 0.7mg/cm²) in platinum usage without reduction in performance. Monash University, Melbourne uses PEDOT as a cathode. A 2011 published study doi: 10.1021/ja1112904 documented the first metal-free electrocatalyst using relatively inexpensive doped carbon nanotubes, which are less than 1% the cost <b>of</b> platinum <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> equal <b>or</b> superior performance. A recently published article demonstrated how the environmental burdens change when using carbon nanotubes as carbon substrate for platinum.|$|R
30|$|In acute {{toxicity}} studies, animal mortality {{could be explained}} via simple observation of clinical signs followed by necropsy [27]. Toxicity signs like a convulsion, abnormal posture, paralysis followed by abnormal necropsy findings on the brain may be pointing to targeted brain toxicity. Where mortality followed these symptoms/signs, a probable cause of death will be established [27]. In this study, ZAL and ZA nanocomposite with and without intercalated levodopa, respectively, were tested at a limit dose based on OECD guidelines 420 [24]. However, no animals exhibited any sign of clinical toxicity; the treatment did not alter their feeding or water intake. This indicated that the newly synthesized LDH-levodopa nanocomposite may be categorized as nanodelivery materials with no obvious clinical toxicity when administered orally for a short period. More than three decades ago, Clarke and Clarke described substances are to <b>be</b> safe <b>and</b> <b>or</b> <b>of</b> low toxicity if they have LD 50 of 1, 000  mg/kg body weight after an oral route administration [28].|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> black <b>or</b> midnight blue; usually <b>of</b> wool <b>or</b> a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed <b>and</b> shawl) <b>are</b> usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a satin weave, but can also be silk barathea. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel <b>and</b> shawl collar <b>are</b> equally authentic <b>and</b> correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|R
