500|$|Although Chamberlain {{racked up}} some of the most {{impressive}} statistics in the history of Northern American professional sports, because he won [...] "just" [...] two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against the Celtics teams of his on-court nemesis Bill Russell, Chamberlain was often called [...] "selfish" [...] and a [...] "loser". Frank Deford of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation: [...] "If you win, <b>everybody</b> <b>says,</b> 'Well, look at him, he's that big.' If you lose, <b>everybody</b> <b>says,</b> 'How could he lose, a guy that size?' [...] " [...] Chamberlain himself often said: [...] "Nobody roots for Goliath." [...] Like later superstar Shaquille O'Neal, Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting, an abysmal [...]511 career average, with a low of [...]380 over the 1967–68 season. Countless suggestions were offered; he shot them underhanded, one-handed, two-handed, {{from the side of the}} circle, from well behind the line, and even banked in. Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw, but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing. [...] Despite his foul line woes, Chamberlain set the NBA record (28) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100-point game.|$|E

Diaz has said, [...] "Fighters are afraid of conditioning, they are afraid of getting tired, but I don’t want to have anxiety or be afraid of anything. I can go 100 percent out there and {{never have to worry about}} getting tired. <b>Everybody</b> <b>says</b> fighting is 90 percent mental, and it's true. Knowing you can go 15 minutes or 25 minutes without any problem can help you sustain that mental advantage over your opponent..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maldonado {{withdrew from}} the race on January 16, 2014. His {{campaign}} was beset by problems: he accused Governor Brown of things that occurred years before he was elected, he struggled to raise money, his campaign's senior staff left in September 2013, and his campaign failed to gain traction after the entry of fellow Republicans Tim Donnelly and Neel Kashkari into the race. In announcing his withdrawal, Maldonado said: [...] "Now is not my time... I know it's cliché to say I am not running so I can {{spend more time with}} my family. <b>Everybody</b> <b>says</b> that. But the truth is, that is, a major factor in my decision today. I have missed some birthdays, family holidays and even anniversaries. From this day forward [...] now controls my schedule." ...|$|E
