Chromodomo - Laura White,  'Scratching Walls and Sticky Décor. '  20 September - 18 October 2009. Launch of Chromodoma and private view for Laura White: 'Scratching Walls and Sticky Decor'  20 th Sept 2009. Publication :CHROMODOMO. Published by Wandelroute T. G. V, Groningen, Netherlands, Exhibition Description:  Everything we have in our household is coloured, ranging from the cleaning cloths and sponges to the tableware. From our clothes to the <b>fly</b> <b>curtain,</b> not to mention the unrequested and often undesired advertising leaflets or packs of fruit juice. It is primarily the colourful nature of this world, which has become self-evident to us, that Laura White researches and uses in her installation for Chromodomo.  White blurs the boundaries between the existing interior, the furniture, and the new items she introduces. She creates compilations of objects with which we are thoroughly familiar, in combination with added constructions made of clay, among other things. The installation in the Wall House acquires extra significance {{due to the fact that}} White draws inspiration from the remarkably awkward drawings by John Hejduk, the architect of the Wall House, featuring animals with masks and strange angels, occasionally with reed aprons. Keeping these drawings in mind, White researches the Wall House via Hejduk’s universe. Tables may wear aprons, and by means of the mounds of clay she pulls the ‘outside’ inside once again. Hejduk would have been most amused. By Kie Ellen, Director of The Wall House # 2...|$|E
5000|$|Traveler style {{curtains}} {{can also}} be raised and lowered by a fly system, in which case they {{are referred to as}} <b>fly</b> <b>curtains</b> or, less frequently, guillotine curtains because they rise and fall much like a guillotine. When operated in this manner, they require at least as much fly space above them as the height of the curtain itself, but they allow a production to reveal or conceal the stage extremely quickly.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990-1992, Anninsky {{worked in}} Literaturnoye obozrenye (The Literature Review), then joined {{the newly formed}} Rodina {{magazine}} and in 1998 became {{the editor of the}} short-lived Vremya i my (Time And Us) project. Among his works of the time were The <b>Flying</b> <b>Curtain</b> (Essays on Georgian literature, 1990), Men of the Sixties and Our Times (subtitled: [...] "The Cinema that Made History and the One that Never Did," [...] 1991), The Bards (1999). His 1997 book The Silver and the Black (subtitled: [...] "The Russian, the Soviet, the Slavic and the Worldly in the Silver Age poetry"), on the 12 poets of the early 20th century, formed the basis for the TV documentary series of the same title. Directed by Vitaly Maksimov and premiered on Kultura TV in 2004, it brought Anninsky two TEFIs (in [...] "The Best Script" [...] and [...] "The Best TV Documentary" [...] categories). In 2010, Lev Anninsky received the [...] "White Elephant" [...] (Слон), the Russian Guild of Film Critics' award. Since 2003, Annensky {{has been a member of}} the Yasnaya Polyana Literary Award jury.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} stage {{absorption}} on reverberation times in opera houses were investigated using computer simulations and scale model measurements. The reverberation time (RT) {{was measured in}} stalls seating with and without variable stage elements (e. g., <b>fly</b> <b>curtains,</b> side curtains, cycloramas, and stage sets). The absorption coefficients of {{the walls and ceiling}} of the stage houses were varied accordingly. It was found that variable stage elements have a significant influence on reverberation times in seating areas, particularly for a reverberant stage house, due to the low absorption of the walls and ceiling in the stage house. It was also found that the absorption coefficients of the walls and ceiling should be over 0. 5 to avoid RT decreases of over 10 % due to the absorption of the variable stage elements. In addition, coupled room effects were investigated both with and without variable stage elements and the results show that double slope was not found in the opera houses investigated in this study.

60|$|The eating-house, {{the rooms}} and hallways, {{were all of}} that desolate shabbiness which comes from shiftlessness joined with poverty. The carpets were frayed and stained with tobacco-juice, and the dusty windows were {{littered}} with dead <b>flies.</b> The <b>curtains</b> were ragged, the paper peeling from the walls, and the plastering cracked into unsightly lines. Everything on which the girl's eyes fell contrasted strongly with her aunt's home on the Brandywine--not because that house was large or luxurious, {{but because it was}} exquisitely in order, and sweet with flowers and dainty arrangement of color.|$|R
50|$|A {{traveler}} curtain, {{also called}} draw curtain, bi-parting curtain, or just traveler, {{is the most}} common type of front curtain used in theaters. Traveler curtains remain at a fixed elevation and open and close horizontally, breaking in the middle, and consequently require a minimum of <b>fly</b> space. The <b>curtains</b> are typically made of velvet and decorated with a series of vertical box pleats along the top edge.|$|R
60|$|On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled {{onto the}} bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz {{curtains}} in a most flattering state of expectancy. There {{was a good deal}} of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the <b>curtains</b> <b>flew</b> apart, and the operatic tragedy began.|$|R
6000|$|Across {{an empty}} stall a green cloth was fastened, {{so high that}} {{the heads of the}} {{operators}} were not seen. A little <b>curtain</b> <b>flew</b> up, disclosing the front of a Chinese pagoda painted on pasteboard, with a door and window which opened quite naturally. This stood on one side, several green trees with paper lanterns hanging from the boughs were on the other side, and the words [...] "Tea Garden," [...] printed over the top, showed the nature of this charming spot.|$|R
60|$|So {{he opened}} more doors, {{and in a}} long drawing-room came upon five or six manservants, all in the grey house-jackets, all clean-shaven, neat, with neat black hair, all with dusters or brushes or feather brooms, and all frolicking, chattering, playing like so many monkeys. They were all of the same neat, smallish size. They were all laughing. They rolled back a great rug {{as if it were}} some {{football}} game, one <b>flew</b> at the <b>curtains.</b> And they merely looked at Aaron and went on chattering, and laughing and dusting.|$|R
5000|$|TIME {{magazine}} proclaims in its two-page spread: “With {{the crash}} of a gong, the <b>curtain</b> <b>flies</b> up and smoke billows out from the stage as a team of magicians begins 2½ hours of joyous entertainment that recalls the most opulent days of vaudeville [...] [...] [...] [...] Spectacular it is [...] [...] [...] The real magic about Le Grand David is the cast and their locale. The show goes on not on Broadway but in Beverly, Mass., a Boston suburb, though it looks as lushly endowed as any Great White Way musical,” (Jeff Melvoin, “Conjuring Only On Sundays,” TIME magazine, May 12, 1980).|$|R
2500|$|Ford premiered the Taurus in {{a resounding}} way. In mid-1985, Ford {{gathered}} executives {{and the press}} for the unveiling of the Taurus and Mercury Sable. The event {{took place at the}} MGM Studios Soundstage 85, where Gone with the Wind had been filmed. The studio was decorated in a space theme, with stars on the walls, flying saucer decorations, and refreshments served in flying saucer shaped coolers. For the unveiling, [...] "space" [...] music started playing, as projected stars floated around the room in dance floor fashion. The outlines of the cars glowed green through the curtain; as the <b>curtain</b> <b>flew</b> up, strobe lights flashed, highlighting the cars.|$|R
50|$|A <b>curtain</b> <b>flies</b> off of an {{open window}} {{as a result of}} the gust outside and Bozo slips on it into the next room, taking Buddy with him. The dog rushes through a threshold, but Buddy is knocked upwards onto a balcony, from which he can clearly see Cookie when she briefly emerges from a doorway to scream for help. Buddy finds his way over the balcony and knocks on the very door, but the Musician peeks out of a little hole in the top and taunts Our Hero. The door is locked, so Buddy simply picks up a nearby door and drops it next to the one through which he wishes to enter the room. Easily {{attaining}} access in this clever fashion, Buddy spies the Musician still standing at the door, unaware of his enemy's entrance.|$|R
500|$|Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, Are You Experienced spent 33 {{weeks on}} the charts, peaking at number two. It was {{prevented}} from reaching the top spot by the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. On June 4, 1967, Hendrix opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with his rendition of Sgt. Pepper title track, which was released just three days previous. Beatles manager Brian Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and both George Harrison and Paul McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: [...] "The <b>curtains</b> <b>flew</b> back and he came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down {{as one of the}} great honors of my career." [...] Released in the U.S. on August 23 by Reprise Records, Are You Experienced reached number five on the Billboard 200.|$|R
60|$|Just at {{the moment}} before the little bell rings and the <b>curtain</b> <b>flies</b> up, and we scuffle off to the sides (for we always stay till the very last moment), I {{was in the middle}} of the stage, making myself very affable to the fair figgerantys which was {{spinning}} and twirling about me, and asking them if they wasn't cold, and such like politeness, in the most condescending way possible, when a bolt was suddenly withdrawn, and down I popped, through a trap in the stage, into the place below. Luckily I was stopped by a piece of machinery, consisting of a heap of green blankets and a young lady coming up as Venus rising from the sea. If I had not fallen so soft, I don't know what might have been the consequence of the collusion. I never told Mrs. Coxe, for she can't bear to hear of my paying the least attention to the fair sex.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} design included a multipurpose theater {{at one end}} of the mall. Originally called The Cinema, the house contained a large orchestra seating section, a balcony, and a full stage with a <b>fly</b> area for <b>curtain,</b> scenery, and lighting grid. Early stage crews at The Cinema are credited with coining the now-standard industry term Best Boy to describe an assistant to the chief electrician. In addition to movies, in the 1950s the theater was the site of many live summer theater productions such as Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie and George Abbott and John Cecil Holm's Three Men on a Horse. It was the first movie theater in the country to take advantage of the mall parking lots to provide ample parking during evening hours. In later years, The Cinema became strictly a movie house under the ownership of General Cinema. The Cinema would add a second theater in 1963, and two more in 1974.|$|R
500|$|After {{finishing}} Sgt. Pepper, but {{prior to}} the album's commercial release, the Beatles took an acetate disc of the album to the American singer Cass Elliot's flat off King's Road in Chelsea, where at {{six in the morning}} they played it at full volume with speakers set in open window frames. The group's friend and former press agent, Derek Taylor, remembered that residents of the neighbourhood opened their windows and listened without complaint to what they understood to be unreleased Beatles music. On 26 May 1967, Sgt. Pepper was given a rushed release in the UK, where it was originally scheduled for 1 June. The US release followed on 2 June. It was the first Beatles album where the track listings were exactly the same for the UK and US versions. The band's eighth LP, it debuted in the UK at number one – where it stayed for 22 consecutive weeks – selling 250,000 copies during the first seven days. On 4 June, the Jimi Hendrix Experience opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with their rendition of the title track. Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and Harrison and McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: [...] "The <b>curtains</b> <b>flew</b> back and [...] came walking forward playing 'Sgt. Pepper'. It's a pretty major compliment in anyone's book. I put that down {{as one of the great}} honours of my career." [...] Rolling Stone magazine's Langdon Winner recalls: ...|$|R
5000|$|... center Up in the GalleryIf some frail {{tubercular}} lady circus rider were to {{be driven}} in circles around and around the arena {{for months and months}} without interruption in front of a tireless public on a swaying horse by a merciless whip-wielding master of ceremonies, spinning on the horse, throwing kisses and swaying at the waist, and if this performance, amid the incessant roar of the orchestra and the ventilators, were to continue into the ever-expanding, gray future, accompanied by applause, which died down and then swelled up again, from hands which were really steam hammers, perhaps then a young visitor to the gallery might rush down the long stair case through all the levels, burst into the ring, and cry “Stop!” through the fanfares of the constantly adjusting orchestra.But since things are not like that—since a beautiful woman, in white and red, <b>flies</b> in through <b>curtains</b> which proud men in livery open in front of her, since the director, devotedly seeking her eyes, breathes in her direction, behaving like an animal, and, as a precaution, lifts her up on the dapple-gray horse, as if she were his grand daughter, the one he loved more than anything else, as she starts a dangerous journey, but he cannot decide to give the signal with his whip and finally, controlling himself, gives it a crack, runs right beside the horse with his mouth open, follows the rider’s leaps with a sharp gaze, hardly capable of comprehending her skill, tries to warn her by calling out in English, furiously castigating the grooms holding hoops, telling them to pay the most scrupulous attention, and begs the orchestra, with upraised arms, to be quiet before the great jump, finally lifts the small woman down from the trembling horse, kisses her on both cheeks, considers no public tribute adequate, while she herself, leaning on him, high on the tips of her toes, with dust swirling around her, arms outstretched and head thrown back, wants to share her luck with the entire circus—since this is how things are, the visitor to the gallery puts his face on the railing and, sinking into the final march as if into a difficult dream, weeps, without realizing it.|$|R
60|$|I left Venice {{the next}} morning, {{as soon as}} I learned that the old lady had not succumbed, as I feared at the moment, to the shock I had given her--the shock I may also say she had given me. How {{in the world could}} I have {{supposed}} her capable of getting out of bed by herself? I failed to see Miss Tita before going; I only saw the donna, whom I entrusted with a note for her younger mistress. In this note I mentioned that I should be absent but for a few days. I went to Treviso, to Bassano, to Castelfranco; I took walks and drives and looked at musty old churches with ill-lighted pictures and spent hours seated smoking at the doors of cafes, where there were <b>flies</b> and yellow <b>curtains,</b> on the shady side of sleepy little squares. In spite of these pastimes, which were mechanical and perfunctory, I scantily enjoyed my journey: there was too strong a taste of the disagreeable in my life. I had been devilish awkward, as the young men say, to be found by Miss Bordereau {{in the dead of night}} examining the attachment of her bureau; and it had not been less so to have to believe for a good many hours afterward that it was highly probable I had killed her. In writing to Miss Tita I attempted to minimize these irregularities; but as she gave me no word of answer I could not know what impression I made upon her. It rankled in my mind that I had been called a publishing scoundrel, for certainly I did publish and certainly I had not been very delicate. There was a moment when I stood convinced that the only way to make up for this latter fault was to take myself away altogether on the instant; to sacrifice my hopes and relieve the two poor women forever of the oppression of my intercourse. Then I reflected that I had better try a short absence first, for I must already have had a sense (unexpressed and dim) that in disappearing completely it would not be merely my own hopes that I should condemn to extinction. It would perhaps be sufficient if I stayed away long enough to give the elder lady time to think she was rid of me. That she would wish to be rid of me after this (if I was not rid of her) was now not to be doubted: that nocturnal scene would have cured her of the disposition to put up with my company for the sake of my dollars. I said to myself that after all I could not abandon Miss Tita, and I continued to say this even while I observed that she quite failed to comply with my earnest request (I had given her two or three addresses, at little towns, post restante) that she would let me know how she was getting on. I would have made my servant write to me but that he was unable to manage a pen. It struck me there was a kind of scorn in Miss Tita's silence (little disdainful as she had ever been), so that I was uncomfortable and sore. I had scruples about going back and yet I had others about not doing so, for I wanted to put myself on a better footing. The end of it was that I did return to Venice on the twelfth day; and as my gondola gently bumped against Miss Bordereau's steps a certain palpitation of suspense told me that I had done myself a violence in holding off so long.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not only}} with the spirits of the dead that the warlike people of the North made war without timidity, and {{successfully}} entered into suits of ejectment. These daring champions often braved the indignation even of the superior deities of their mythology, rather than allow that there existed any being before whom their boldness could quail. Such is the singular story how a young man of high courage, in crossing a desolate ridge of mountains, met with a huge waggon, in which the goddess, Freya (i.e., a gigantic idol formed to represent her), together with her shrine, and the wealthy offerings attached to it, was travelling from one district of the country to another. The shrine, or sanctuary of the idol, was, like a modern caravan travelling with a show, screened by boards and curtains from the public gaze, and the equipage was under the immediate guidance of the priestess of Freya, a young, good-looking, and attractive woman. The traveller naturally associated himself with the priestess, who, as she walked on foot, apparently was in no degree displeased with the company of a powerful and handsome young man, as a guide and companion on the journey. It chanced, however, that the presence of the champion, and his discourse with the priestess, was less satisfactory to the goddess than to the parties principally concerned. By a certain signal the divinity summoned the priestess to the sanctuary, who presently returned, with tears in her eyes and terror in her countenance, to inform her companion that it was the will of Freya that he should depart, and no longer travel in their company. [...] "You must have mistaken the meaning of the goddess," [...] said the champion; [...] "Freya cannot have formed a wish so unreasonable as to desire I should abandon the straight and good road, which leads me directly on my journey, to choose precipitous paths and by-roads, where I may break my neck." [...] "Nevertheless," [...] said the priestess, [...] "the goddess will be highly offended if you disobey her commands, nor can I conceal from you that she may personally assault you." [...] "It will be at her own peril if she should be so audacious," [...] said the champion, [...] "for I will try the power of this axe against the strength of beams and boards." [...] The priestess chid him for his impiety; but being unable to compel him to obey the goddess's mandate, they again relapsed into familiarity, which advanced to such a point that a clattering noise within the tabernacle, as of machinery put in motion, intimated to the travellers that Freya, who perhaps had some qualities in common with the classical Vesta, thought a personal interruption of this tête-à-tête ought to be deferred no longer. The <b>curtains</b> <b>flew</b> open, and the massive and awkward idol, who, we may suppose, resembled in form the giant created by Frankenstein, leapt lumbering from the carriage, and, rushing on the intrusive traveller, dealt him, with its wooden hands and arms, such tremendous blows, as were equally difficult to parry or to endure. But the champion was armed with a double-edged Danish axe, with which he bestirred himself with so much strength and activity, that at length he split the head of the image, and with a severe blow hewed off its left leg. The image of Freya then fell motionless to the ground, and the demon which had animated it fled yelling from the battered tenement. The champion was now victor; and, according to the law of arms, took possession of the female and the baggage. The priestess, the divinity of whose patroness had been by the event of the combat sorely lessened in her eyes, was now easily induced to become the associate and concubine of the conqueror. She accompanied him to the district whither he was travelling, and there displayed the shrine of Freya, taking care to hide the injuries which the goddess had received in the brawl. The champion came in for a share of a gainful trade driven by the priestess, besides appropriating to himself most of the treasures which the sanctuary had formerly contained. Neither does it appear that Freya, having, perhaps, a sensible recollection {{of the power of the}} axe, ever again ventured to appear in person for the purpose of calling her false stewards to account.|$|R
