40|$|While the {{positive}} return differential of the United States {{has attracted a}} lot of attention in the literature, the factors underlying the dynamics of the <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> balance have so far not been systematically investigated. Here, we propose a novel decomposition framework that accounts for the changes in net <b>investment</b> <b>income.</b> This allows us to disentangle contributions of changes in yield level and yield spread from those of changes in stocks as well as composition and portfolio effects. The analysis contributes conceptually {{to the question of how}} <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> might facilitate international risk sharing. We apply our decomposition framework to a rich German dataset spanning 11 different investment classes and provide a forensic account of the increase in the German <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> balance between 1999 and 2014. Focusing exclusively on the aggregate development of external assets and liabilities falls short of explaining the growth in German net <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> and around 40 % of the increase is explained by changes in yields. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering the composition of external assets and liabilities as well as portfolio changes in order to understand the dynamics of the <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> balance...|$|R

50|$|<b>Investment</b> <b>Income</b> has fluctuated in {{the last}} 15 years, 1999-2013, with five years of losses and 10 years of gains. There were <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> gains of $17 billion in 1999, $16 billion in 2000 and five billion dollars in 2003. The stock market declines in 2001 led to <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> losses of 12 billion in 2001 and 10 billion in 2002.

40|$|This nontechnical paper {{discusses}} {{the adverse effects}} of high marginal tax rates on labor <b>income</b> and on <b>investment</b> <b>income.</b> It explains that the deadweight loss of a tax on labor income depends on the response of taxable income {{and not just the}} change in labor supply. An across the board increase in personal tax rates involves a deadweight loss of 76 cents per dollar of revenue and only collects about two-thirds of the revenue implied by a %u 201 Cstatic%u 201 D calculation. A tax on <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> brings a deadweight loss even if household saving does not respond to taxes and the net rate of return. What matters is the response of future consumption. The tax on <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> is also effectively a tax on labor supply because current work effort produces income that will be spent on future consumption and the tax on <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> reduces the future consumption that results from more work today. An appendix shows for a simple log utility case that the tax on labor income has a smaller deadweight loss than a tax on <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> with the same present value of revenue. There is a further discussion of the various ways in which capital income taxes distort economic activity. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{transmission}} of monetary policy in a large Bayesian vector autoregression based on the approach proposed by Banbura, Giannone and Reichlin (2010). The paper analyzes the impact of monetary policy shocks in the United States and Canada not only {{on a range of}} domestic aggregates, trade flows, and exchange rates, but also foreign <b>investment</b> <b>income.</b> The analysis provides three main results. First, a surprise monetary policy action has a statistically and economically significant impact on both gross and net foreign <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> flows in both countries. Against the background of growing foreign wealth and <b>investment</b> <b>income,</b> this result provides preliminary evidence that foreign balance-sheet channels might play an increasingly important role for monetary transmission. Second, the impact of monetary policy on foreign <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> flows differs considerably across asset categories and over time, suggesting that the investment instruments and the currency denomination of a country’s foreign assets and liabilities are potentially relevant for the way in which monetary policy affects the domestic economy. Finally, the results support existing evidence on the effectiveness of large vecto...|$|R
