500|$|For {{the title}} role, King {{required}} the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress Emily Blunt read the script, and aware other actresses would {{fight for the}} part, she approached King early in the search process. Blunt later admitted she had a [...] "non-existent knowledge" [...] of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen [...] "was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, {{and she was in}} a job where she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting". They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon's Daughter. Blunt noted, [...] "I thought [...] was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong-willed, was very <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> In my life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all the time. And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress." [...] After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle, where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself.|$|E

Simple things like a little picture in the window or {{the corner of the}} studio or an old stove in the kitchen have always been <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They are very much alive, these flowers and grasses with the dew on them. Stieglitz always said, [...] "What have you got to say?" [...] I think in a few small cases I've said a few things, expressed how I felt, trying to show the horror of poverty or the beauty of black people. I think that in photography what you've done is what you've had to say. In everything this has been the message of my life. A simple supper, being with someone you love, seeing a deer come around to eat or drink at the barn - I like things like that. If I could make one true, quiet photograph, I would much prefer it to having a lot of answers.|$|E

I meant to tell you not how Americans live in the spirit, illogically, blindly, and blunderingly, but how they live in the body, and more especially how they house themselves in this city of New York. A great many of them do not house themselves at all, but that is a class which we cannot now consider, and I will speak only of those who have some sort of a roof over their heads.|$|E
6000|$|After supper, {{which we}} enjoyed {{as much as}} any meal we ever ate in our lives, we each took a candle, and after {{arranging}} our bedroom for the night, we explored the old house. There were lots of curious things everywhere,--things that were apparently so [...] "old timey," [...] as my wife remarked, that David Dutton did not care to take them with him to his new farm, and so left them for his son, who probably cared for them even less than his father did. There was a garret extending over the whole house, and filled with old spinning-wheels, and strings of onions, and all sorts of antiquated bric-a-brac, which was so <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I could scarcely tear myself away from it; but Euphemia, who was dreadfully afraid that I would set the whole place on fire, at length prevailed on me to come down.|$|E

The subject has become <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have made a great many successful trials of my power, and the affair of this afternoon was nothing but a trial of my powers on a more extensive scale than anything I have yet attempted. I wanted to see if it were possible for me to hypnotize a considerable number of people without any one suspecting what I intended to do. The result was a success. I hypnotized all those people by means of the first part of my performance, which consisted of some combinations of colored glass with lights thrown upon them. They revolved, and looked like fireworks, and were strung on a wire high up on the stage.|$|E

40|$|My {{journey to}} a Ph. D. has been via the scenic route – {{challenging}} and a tad long, but immensely enjoyable {{with a wide}} variety of research experiences and several wonderful mentors. Consequently, I have many people to thank. I sincerely thank Prof. Erin Schuman, my adviser on the experimental part of this thesis, for her surprisingly, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> great belief in my ability. When I first showed up in her office three years ago, Erin accepted my complete lack of experience in experimental biology at that time without so much as a hint of hesitation and permitted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> join her lab. The underlying philosophy of her lab to pursue any question of interest in neuroscience without constraints embodies wonderfully the fundamental spirit of the scientific quest and has facilitated an exciting, fun, and stimulating research experience. Without her support and guidance, I would never have started on the path of experimental neuroscience, a field that continues <b>to</b> <b>fascinate</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> no end, and one that I wish to make my academic home. She has repeatedly encouraged me when I least expected it, and has been a great research mentor. Her deep insight and incisive intellect are qualities I aspire to...|$|R
6000|$|I don’t {{know that}} the {{prospect}} of becoming a favourite of Doña Rita’s peasant sister was very <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> If I went to live very willingly at No. 10 it was because everything connected with Doña Rita had for me a peculiar fascination. She had only passed through the house once as far as I knew; but it was enough. She {{was one of those}} beings that leave a trace. I am not unreasonable—I mean for those that knew her. That is, I suppose, because she was so unforgettable. Let us remember the tragedy of Azzolati the ruthless, the ridiculous financier with a criminal soul (or shall we say heart) and facile tears. No wonder, then, that for me, who may flatter myself without undue vanity with being much finer than that grotesque international intriguer, the mere knowledge that Doña Rita had passed through the very rooms in which I was going to live between the strenuous times of the sea-expeditions, was enough to fill my inner being with a great content. Her glance, her darkly brilliant blue glance, had run over the walls of that room which most likely would be mine to slumber in. Behind me, somewhere near the door, Therese, the peasant sister, said in a funnily compassionate tone and in an amazingly landlady-of-a-boarding-house spirit of false persuasiveness: ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived {{at the end}} of the gallery, we {{ascended the}} broad stone steps, and came to a landing twenty or thirty feet above the level of the floor we had traversed. Here Yoletta pushed a glass door aside and ushered me into another apartment--the Mother's Room. It was spacious, and, unlike the gallery, well-lighted; the air in it was also warm and balmy, and seemed charged with a subtle aroma. But now my whole {{attention}} was concentrated on a group of persons before me, and chiefly on its central figure--the woman I had so much desired to see. She was seated, leaning back in a somewhat listless attitude, on a very large, low, couch-like seat, covered with a soft, violet-colored material. My very first glance at her face revealed to me that she differed in appearance and expression from other inmates of the house: one reason was that she was extremely pale, and bore on her worn countenance the impress of long-continued suffering; but that was not all. She wore her hair, which fell unbound on her shoulders, longer than the others, and her eyes looked larger, and of a deeper green. There was something wonderfully <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in that pale, suffering face, for, in spite of suffering, it was beautiful and loving; but dearer than all these things to my mind were the marks of passion it exhibited, the petulant, almost scornful mouth, and the half-eager, half-weary expression of the eyes, for these seemed rather to belong to that imperfect world from which I had been severed, and which was still dear to my unregenerate heart. In other respects also she differed from the rest of the women, her dress being a long, pale-blue robe, embroidered with saffron-colored flowers and foliage down the middle, and also on the neck and the wide sleeves. On the couch at her side sat the father of the house, holding her hand and talking in low tones to her; two of the young women sat at her feet on cushions, engaged on embroidery work, while another stood behind her; one of the young men was also there, and was just now showing her a sketch, and apparently explaining something in it.|$|E

Bertha, the girl, was a <b>fascinating</b> secret <b>to</b> <b>me</b> still: I trembled under her touch; I felt the witchery of her presence; I yearned to be assured of her love. The fear of poison is feeble against the sense of thirst. Nay, I was just as jealous of my brother as before--just as much irritated by his small patronizing ways; for my pride, my diseased sensibility, were there as they had always been, and winced as inevitably under every offence as my eye winced from an intruding mote. The future, even when brought within the compass of feeling by a vision that made me shudder, had still no more than the force of an idea, compared with the force of present emotion--of my love for Bertha, of my dislike and jealousy towards my brother.|$|R

His life would easily lend itself to riotous romance. In the old country, in a valley below the castle perched on the rack above, he had begun life by tending his father's geese. What a contrast to [...] "Steeltown" [...] with its smells and sickening summer heat, to the shanty where Mrs. Scherer took boarders and bent over the wash-tub!

40|$|In {{this issue}} of the Canadian Respiratory Journal, Marrie et al (pages 336 - 342) present a {{database}} study of hospital admissions among First Nation Aboriginals (FNAs) in Alberta that is <b>fascinating,</b> at least <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They captured all hospital admissions for "status" FNAs from 1997 to 1999, along with data on where and how long they were hospitalized, the severity of the pneumonia, the number of comorbidities present, whether they were readmitted and the costs involved. They compared these finding with a group of age- and sex-matched non-FNAs who were also hospitalized for pneumonia. There are, of course, weaknesses in the study that commonly occur in most exercises using administrative databases. Pneumonia is a hospital record diagnosis (there is no information about chest x-rays, sputum cultures, etc). Pneumonia severity assessment relies on information regarding hospital transfers, intensive care unit admissions and events such as shock, artificial ventilation and death (there is no information available to apply an accepted grading system) (1). Further, "status" FNAs were probably not entirely representative of FNAs in general; indeed, some nonstatus FNAs may well have been included in the control group. However, I strongly doubt that these or similar objections are substantial enough to greatly influence the findings of Marrie et al...|$|R

The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really <b>fascinating</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I thought it was an idea that we hadn't seen on film and I wanted to bring it up on the screen.|$|E

Spiers argued that the focus on the fictional narrative obscures its longer history and connection with the Aborigines: At Hanging Rock we've become obsessed with the myth almost {{to the point where we}} sort of tell it as though it is a true story, but we completely ignore the true losses that have happened there. Most of the Aboriginal people living in that area died of smallpox or were murdered by colonists or removed to Coranderrk Reserve in Healesville in 1836 ...

50|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Axel Alonso {{also suggested}} a possible future crossover between Ultimate Comics: Ultimates, and whatever form the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man series takes after Death of Spider-Man.

I think it's what makes it more exciting. These kids are living in a world where the legends are dead. This is more than just 'the dream is dead,' this is, 'both sides of the argument are dead.' That is just so much more <b>fascinating.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> what was really intriguing to me about where they were now is just in that. These kids have heard both sides, and seen both sides fail miserably. A lot of X-books have been built around that idea, that we're just one step away from everything going to Hell, and in the Ultimate Universe, that's happened. We're there.

60|$|It {{was from}} this <b>fascinating</b> path--the scene <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{of so much}} delicious musing, when life was young and promised to be happy, that I {{have been unable to}} pass it over without an episodical description--it was, I say, from this romantic path that Butler saw the morning arise the day after the murder of Porteous. It was {{possible}} for him with ease to have found a much shorter road to the house to which he was directing his course, and, in fact, that which he chose was extremely circuitous. But to compose his own spirits, as well as to while away the time, until a proper hour for visiting the family without surprise or disturbance, he was induced to extend his circuit by the foot of the rocks, and to linger upon his way until the morning should be considerably advanced. While, now standing with his arms across, and waiting the slow progress of the sun above the horizon, now sitting upon one of the numerous fragments which storms had detached from the rocks above him, he is meditating, alternately upon the horrible catastrophe which he had witnessed, and upon the melancholy, and to him most interesting, news which he had learned at Saddletree's, we will give the reader to understand who Butler was, and how his fate was connected with that of Effie Deans, the unfortunate handmaiden of the careful Mrs. Saddletree.|$|R
