5|$|M-103 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state trunkline in 1932. The first version ran from SR13 at the state line northerly to the junction with US112 and US 131 in White Pigeon. At the time, US131 turned westerly along US112 before turning south to connect with SR15. This first version of M-103 was completed paved by 1934. The routings of US131 and M-103 were swapped south of US12 (successor to US112) by 1960. Since that time, M-103 has been routed between US12 and SR15 in western Mottville Township and US131 has run <b>due</b> <b>south</b> of White Pigeon to SR13.|$|E

5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and {{it was estimated that}} the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned <b>due</b> <b>south</b> to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.|$|E
5|$|By 5 April, the JTWC began issuing {{advisories}} on Gwenda, classifying it as a weak {{tropical storm}} and designating it as Cyclone 32S. Tracking southwest {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the south, Gwenda began to rapidly intensify. Its forward motion significantly decreased as it turned <b>due</b> <b>south</b> before curving towards the southeast, and in a 30-hour span, maximum winds around the centre of the storm increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph). The barometric pressure decreased by 90hPa (mbar), making Gwenda one of the fastest intensifying storms on record. At the end of the intensification phase on 7April, the Bureau of Meteorology classified the storm as a Category 5 cyclone, the third of the season, with a pressure of 900hPa (mbar). The JTWC also reported a substantial increase in intensity, classifying Gwenda as a high-end Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute sustained winds of 240km/h (150mph).|$|E

5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining {{displaced from}} the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane steadily intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of the}} cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located <b>due</b> <b>south</b> of the area of high pressure and tracking steadily towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category3 hurricane in 36hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of the Mounted and Challenge of the Yukon continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series <b>Due</b> <b>South</b> which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E
5|$|Five miles (8km) past West Shokan, NY28A intersects Monument Road, {{which used}} to connect to the reservoir's {{spillway}} and the road above the reservoir, which is closed to automobile traffic. The junction has {{been converted into a}} small parking area. A quarter-mile (0.4km) further on is the western terminus of NY213, the only other state route that NY28A intersects aside from its parent. Although NY213 is an east–west route, it actually heads <b>due</b> <b>south</b> from this junction to the nearby hamlet of Olivebridge on its way to Stone Ridge and High Falls. Continuing east, NY28A descends to cross Esopus Creek again before climbing back up to the city's watershed visitor center.

5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the zenith distances with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed <b>due</b> <b>south.</b> Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from collimating the sector.|$|E

SR202 turns east onto a pair of one-way streets, Redmond Way and Cleveland Street, at the terminus of former SR908. The streets pass the Redmond Town Center shopping center and merge onto Redmond Way, crossing over Bear Creek and under a freeway interchange with SR520. SR202 continues southeasterly along the edge of Marymoor Park near the north shore of Lake Sammamish, leaving Redmond and briefly entering the city of Sammamish.|$|E
5|$|The Students' Building was {{designed}} by the New York City architecture firm of McKim, Mead & White, representing their only project at Vassar College. The plans were drawn up by young architect Joseph Herenden Clark, a recent graduate of the Columbia School of Architecture who, upon hearing the requirement that the structure be made from brick with white trim and a slate roof, recalled Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Clark had studied Christ Church, which George Washington attended, during his days at Columbia. He trekked to Alexandria to study the interior and exterior {{of the church and}} ultimately the designs for the Students' Building, his first public plan, were inspired by its architecture and features. Bishop and Company were contracted to construct the Students' Building, an example of the Southern colonial revival style. It sits on the north edge of campus <b>due</b> <b>south</b> of the college's North Gate and southeast of residential quad dorms like Lathrop House. Noyes House was built in 1958 and rests immediately to the southeast of the Students' Building.|$|E

Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned <b>due</b> <b>south,</b> continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{originally}} designated as Route 202 in 1933. By 1934, a road headed <b>due</b> <b>south</b> from Seeley, before turning east through Calexico and curving {{slightly to the}} north and then east again through Bonds Corners. The easternmost portion of the highway was unpaved. By 1938, the road from Coyote Wells east to the then-current routing had been constructed, but was a county road; the entirety of Route 98, which was signed, was either gravel or asphalt. Between 1952 and 1954, the western portion of SR 98 was rerouted onto the county road, moving the western terminus to southwest of Coyote Wells; however, the new portion was not paved. By 1956, the entire highway was paved. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the highway was officially renumbered as Route 98. I-8 was extended to the western terminus of SR 98 by 1965, and to the eastern terminus of SR 98 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or <b>due</b> <b>south</b> (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
