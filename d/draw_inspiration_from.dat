25|$|Although his {{scholarly}} {{work was}} never subordinated to his early political beliefs, {{the school of}} thought he was associated with in interwar Romania, namely Trăirism, {{as well as the}} works of Julius Evola he continued to <b>draw</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>from,</b> have thematic links to fascism.
