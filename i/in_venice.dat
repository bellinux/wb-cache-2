5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} he had reached the limits of what he could {{accomplish}} <b>in</b> <b>Venice,</b> and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months <b>in</b> <b>Venice.</b> On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Monteverdi {{was in his}} sixties, and his rate of {{composition}} seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was published <b>in</b> <b>Venice</b> in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632.

5|$|The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{containing}} his hagiography, {{prayers to}} him, and hymns to be chanted in church services on his feast day, was printed <b>in</b> <b>Venice</b> in 1690. The book was reprinted with {{small changes in}} 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy of the Orthodox Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, {{as part of a}} compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region. A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed <b>in</b> <b>Venice</b> (1819) and Athens (1868). Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared <b>in</b> <b>Venice</b> (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of Srbljak, a compendium of akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book Lives of the Serbian Saints, published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.|$|E

Percy arrived <b>in</b> <b>Venice,</b> telling Byron {{he had the}} entire family. Mary was thus summoned to Venice to substantiate Percy's story. However, baby Clara Shelley was sick and traveling made her even more ill.

It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a British subject.|$|E
