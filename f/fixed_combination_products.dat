40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the number of {{patients}} treated for hypertension and the evolution in usage of different classes of antihypertensive medication. Methods Data from 1997 to 2009 was extracted from Pharmanet, a nation-wide database of prescriptions of reimbursed medication in Belgium. Results In 2009, 25 % of women and 20 % of men were prescribed at least one antihypertensive drug. Prescription rates rose with age but already 25 % of the population aged between 41 and 60 years were treated. More than 50 % of the Belgians above 60 years took antihypertensive medication. From 1997 to 2009, a rise in absolute prescription rate was observed for all antihypertensive drug classes. Diuretics and beta blockers remain by far the most frequently delivered drugs with stable prescription rates of 30 % over this period. The largest rise is observed for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which were only sporadically prescribed in 1997 and now account for 10. 5 % of the delivered antihypertensive drugs. A small rise is also noted for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) (12. 3 % in 1997 vs 15. 6 % in 2009). Their success comes at the expense of calcium antagonists, of which the delivered amount declined from 19. 8 % in 1997 tot 14. 1 % in 2009. A progressive rise in the prescription of <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is observed (from 15 % in 1997 to 21 % in 2009), and can probably be attributed to their growing availability but also to the recent guidelines, promoting their usage. Conclusion Above age 60, the majority of the Belgians are treated with antihypertensive medication. There is a growing tendency for the use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers and <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lumefantrine (benflumetol) is a {{fluorene}} derivative {{belonging to}} the aryl amino alcohol class of antimalarial drugs and is commercially available in <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> with b-artemether. Impurity characterization of such drugs, which are widely consumed in tropical countries for malaria control programmes, is of paramount importance. However, until now, no exhaustive impurity profile of lumefantrine has been established, encompassing process-related and degradation impurities in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished pharmaceutical products (FPPs). Methods: Using HPLC-DAD/UV-ESI/ion trap/MS, a comprehensive impurity profile was established based upon analysis of market samples as well as stress, accelerated and long-term stability results.

40|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the ability of}} atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin to improve coronary heart disease clinical outcomes. Atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin {{have been shown to}} reduce strokes. While these drugs improve clinical outcomes the absolute risk reduction is small. Fair to good strength evidence demonstrates that when statins are provided in doses that are approximately equipotent, a similar percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol can be achieved, along with comparable increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In adult patients with no known coronary heart disease there were still no head to head trials of statins or <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> containing a statin (and another lipid lowering drug) for health outcomes. There are no clinical outcome studies for <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> containing a statin and another lipid lowering agent.

40|$|Background: Topical therapies are the {{mainstay}} of treatment for psoriasis vulgaris. The fixed combination of calcipotriol (Cal) 50 mu g/g plus betamethasone 0. 5 mg/g (as dipropionate; BD) is a first-line topical treatment and available as a gel or ointment. The use of these <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> was compared in PRO-long, a long-term noninterventional study, for which interim results (4 and 12 weeks) have previously been reported. Objective: To describe and compare patients' perspectives on the fixed combination gel and ointment formulations; to include efficacy, adherence behaviour, treatment satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) aspects during long-term real-life psoriasis management. Methods: PRO-long was a multicentre, prospective, observational, 52 -week study of patients prescribed fixed combination Cal/BD gel or ointment in clinical practice. For final analysis the following were assessed at weeks 24, 36 and 52 : differences {{in the proportion of}} patients with 'mild'/'very mild' disease according to patient's global assessment of disease severity, adherence behaviour, treatment satisfaction (nine-item treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication) and HRQoL (Skindex- 29). Results: Patients (n = 328) were prescribed once-daily Cal/BD gel (n = 152) or ointment (n = 176). At week 52, a higher proportion of patients reported that the severity of their psoriasis was 'mild'/'very mild' vs. baseline (gel: 60. 2 vs. 47. 1 %; ointment: 58. 8 vs. 42. 4 %), with greater treatment satisfaction reported in patients using gel vs. those using ointment. A higher proportion of patients found the gel 'easy' to use compared with the ointment (66. 7 vs. 45. 2 %). Daily application of treatment took <= 5 min for 86. 1 % of patients using gel and 71. 0 % of patients using ointment. Conclusion: This real-life study has demonstrated similar effectiveness between the Cal/BD formulations. However, over a 52 -week treatment period, patients reported greater treatment satisfaction with the gel, which was considered easier to use, faster to apply and overall a more convenient product...|$|E
50|$|Belladonna tinctures, decoctions, and powders, {{as well as}} {{alkaloid}} salt mixtures, {{are still}} produced for pharmaceutical use, and these are often standardised at 1037 parts hyoscyamine to 194 parts atropine and 65 parts scopolamine. The alkaloids are compounded with phenobarbital and/or kaolin and pectin for use in various functional gastrointestinal disorders. The tincture, used for identical purposes, remains in most pharmacopoeias, with a similar tincture of Datura stramonium having been in the US Pharmacopoeia {{at least until the}} late 1930s. Cigarettes with belladonna leaves soaked in opium tincture were a prescription medicine as recently as 1930. The combination of belladonna and opium, in powder, tincture, or alkaloid form, is particularly useful by mouth or as a suppository for diarrhoea and some forms of visceral pain; it can be made by a compounding pharmacist, and may be available as a manufactured <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> in some countries (e.g., B&O Supprettes).

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of drugs available are of little importance in terms of fulfilling primary healthcare needs. Combination drugs {{increase the risk of}} side effects, lead to an ineffective dosage and liability to abuse and may also needlessly increase the cost.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPsoriasis vulgaris is characterised by {{epidermal}} hyper-proliferation and {{infiltration of}} immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells. The inflammation {{is driven by}} a complex interplay between immune and skin cells involving interleukin (IL) - 17 A, IL- 23 and TNF-α as key drivers. The calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate two-compound <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> is widely used for topical treatment of psoriasis. However, the mechanism behind its high efficacy has not been elucidated in detail. ObjectiveHere, we investigated and compared the immune modulatory effects of betamethasone, calcipotriol and the combination in ex vivo cultures of psoriatic skin and in vitro cultures of primary human cells that recapitulate key cellular activities of psoriatic inflammation. MethodThe immune modulatory effect of the treatments on psoriatic skin and on in vitro differentiated Th 1 /Th 17 cells, Tc 1 /Tc 17 cells, monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells and primary keratinocytes was assessed {{by a panel of}} inflammatory and phenotypic related transcription factors and cytokines. The expression was evaluated by both gene and protein analysis. ResultsCompared to vehicle control or mono-treatments, the effect of calcipotriol/betamethasone combination was significantly better in inhibiting the secretion of IL- 17 A and TNF-α in psoriatic skin. Additionally, the two components showed additive inhibitory effects on secretion of IL- 23 and TNF-α by DCs, of IL- 17 A and TNF-α by both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells and reduced inflammatory responses in Th 17 -stimulated keratinocytes. Furthermore, calcipotriol was found to enhance IL- 10 secretion in psoriatic skin and in human T cells, to induce secretion of type 2 cytokines by T cells and, lastly, to significantly modulate the differentiation of DCs and T cells. ConclusionsIn summary, we demonstrate a unique and supplementary immune modulatory effect of calcipotriol/betamethasone combination on TNF-α and IL- 23 /Th 17 immune axis, supporting the superior clinical efficacy of the <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> compared to the respective mono-treatments in psoriasis patients...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary drug {{delivery}} {{is characterized by}} short onset times of the effects and an increased therapeutic ratio compared to oral {{drug delivery}}. This delivery route {{can be used for}} local as well as for systemic absorption applying drugs as single substance or as a <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combination.</b> Drugs can be delivered as nebulized aerosols or as dry powders. A screening system able to mimic delivery by the different devices might help to assess the drug effect in the different formulations and to identify potential interference between drugs in <b>fixed</b> dose <b>combinations.</b> The present study evaluates manual devices used in animal studies for their suitability for cellular studies. Calu- 3 cells were cultured submersed and in air-liquid interface culture and characterized regarding mucus production and transepithelial electrical resistance. The influence of pore size and material of the transwell membranes and of the duration of air-liquid interface culture was assessed. Compounds were applied in solution and as aerosols generated by MicroSprayer IA- 1 C Aerosolizer or by DP- 4 Dry Powder Insufflator using fluorescein and rhodamine 123 as model compounds. Budesonide and formoterol, singly and in combination, served as examples for drugs relevant in pulmonary delivery. Membrane material and duration of air-liquid interface culture had no marked effect on mucus production and tightness of the cell monolayer. Co-application of budesonide and formoterol, applied in solution or as aerosol, increased permeation of formoterol across cells in air-liquid interface culture. Problems with the DP- 4 Dry Powder Insufflator included compound-specific delivery rates and influence on the tightness of the cell monolayer. These problems were not encountered with the MicroSprayer IA- 1 C Aerosolizer. The combination of Calu- 3 cells and manual aerosol generation devices appears suitable to identify interactions of drugs in <b>fixed</b> drug <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> on permeation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinicians {{have been}} {{reluctant}} to prescribe benzoyl peroxide concurrently with topical tretinoin due to a belief that the benzoyl peroxide may cause oxidation and degradation of the tretinoin molecule, thereby reducing its effectiveness. However, benzoyl peroxide-induced degradation of tretinoin may not necessarily apply to all topical tretinoin formulations. Objective: To evaluate the potential for benzoyl peroxide-induced degradation of an optimized aqueous gel formulation of tretinoin (0. 05 %). Methods: Tretinoin gel (0. 05 %) and benzoyl peroxide gel (6. 26 % premix concentration to produce 5 % benzoyl peroxide in a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> clindamycin <b>product)</b> were mixed together (1 : 1) at 32 ºC and samples assayed after 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 hours. Each sample was analyzed for tretinoin (expressed as % tretinoin remaining) and its degradation product content. Results: No loss of tretinoin was observed over the seven-hour time period. When tretinoin gel (0. 05 %) was combined with benzoyl peroxide, 100 percent of the initial tretinoin concentration remained after seven hours. There was no increase in the degradation products of tretinoin. Conclusions: There was no benzoyl peroxide-induced degradation of tretinoin when the optimized formulation of tretinoin gel (0. 05 %) was admixed with benzoyl peroxide gel (6. 26 %). Although the direct clinical significance of these results is unknown, clinicians may feel comfortable using this particular combination concurrently without concerns about tretinoin oxidation and degradation...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety profile}} of {{paracetamol}} and simvastatin is sufficiently well known, although no interactions {{between these two}} medicinal products have been described in the scientific literature so far. A- 66 -year-old female patient who experienced myocardial infarction and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 9 years ago was taking simvastatin at a daily dose of 10 mg. Liver enzyme tests were carried out regularly, and their results were always normal. Later on, the patient took 6 tablets of <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> medicinal <b>product</b> GripexTM (paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, and dextromethorphan) per day due to a fever. The daily dose of paracetamol taken by the patient totaled 1. 95 g. The patient developed severe jaundice, nausea, vomiting; blood bilirubin levels increased more than 3 times; ALT, more than 10 times; and AST, more than 5 times. Paracetamol is metabolized by CYP enzymes (CYP 2 E 1, 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 3 A 4) to a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone- imine (NAPQI). Under conditions of excessive NAPQI formation or reduction in glutathione stores by approximately 70 %, NAPQI covalently binds to the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins, forming NAPQI-protein adducts. Simvastatin is a substrate of CYP 3 A 4 enzyme. Clinical and pharmacological data, available in the published literature, allow the assumption that simvastatin may induce CYP 3 A 4 and result in increased hepatoxicity of paracetamol...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Combining two {{medications}} in one bottle {{may improve}} compliance {{by reducing the}} time required to administer drops and the frequency {{of the total number of}} medication bottles. Objective. To compare the efficacy of reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) and safety of <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> travoprost 0. 004 %/timolol 0. 5 % vs. <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> dorzolamide 2 %/timolol 0. 5 % in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods. Prospective randomized clinical study included 60 patients divided into 2 groups. Follow-up was done at day 14 and 45 and month 3. IOP measurements were taken at each follow-up examination at 8 am, 10 am and 4 pm. Results. Both <b>fixed</b> <b>combinations</b> reduced IOP significantly compared to initial values at all follow-ups (p< 0. 001). Mean pooled IOP at all visits and time points was slightly lower in the travoprost/timolol group compared with the dorzolamide/timolol group (16. 13 mmHg vs. 16. 15 mmHg). Mean IOP reduction from baseline ranged from - 7. 46 mmHg to - 9. 92 mmHg in the travoprost/timolol group and from - 6. 93 mmHg to - 8. 93 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol group. Mean (±standard error of the mean) reduction in diurnal IOP from baseline to 3 rd month was 8. 96 ± 2. 79 in the travoprost/timolol group versus 8. 07 ± 2. 91 in patients receiving dorzolamide/timolol <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> (p= 0. 196). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were conjunctival hyperemia in the travoprost/timolol group, and dry eye and foreign body sensation in the dorzolamide/timolol group. Conclusion. Travoprost/timolol <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> was slightly more effective than dorzolamide/timolol <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> in reducing mean diurnal IOP. Travoprost/timolol group resulted in an IOP reduction for up to 1. 07 mmHg higher than dorzolamide/timolol group. Both <b>fixed</b> <b>combinations</b> were well tolerated and safe...|$|R
40|$|This article, {{the fifth}} {{in a series}} on the {{regulation}} of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> in the US, considers {{the state of the}} quality system regulatory framework for <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> This article is not a commentary on the recently published proposed rule 1 or the previously published draft guidance 2 on quality systems for <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> Rather, it describes approaches based on existing regulations that may be taken now to establish a compliant quality system for the manufacture of a <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> in anticipation of the final rule. Manufacturers should prepare for the day when the quality system regulation for <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is final. Six months after the final rule is issued it will become an enforceable requirement. By then, FDA is also expected to have issued additional guidance explaining how manufacturers of single-entity or kit <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> may implement a quality system that combines elements from more than one quality standard (i. e., a streamlined quality system). Currently, there is no final regulation or guidance describing requirements for a <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> quality system. The principles described in the proposed rule and the draft guidance are similar. They are not final but they reflect FDA’s current thinking...|$|R
40|$|Drug-device <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> {{introduced}} a new dynamic on medical product development, regulatory approval, and corporate interaction that provide valuable lessons {{for the development of}} new generations of <b>combination</b> <b>products.</b> This paper examines the case studies of drug-eluting stents and transdermal patches to facilitate a detailed understanding of the challenges and opportunities introduced by <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> when compared to previous generations of traditional medical or drug delivery devices. Our analysis indicates that the largest barrier to introduce a new kind of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is the determination of the regulatory center that is to oversee its approval. The first product of a new class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> offers a learning opportunity for the regulator and the sponsor. Once that first product is approved, the leading regulatory center is determined, and the uncertainty about the entire class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> is drastically reduced. The sponsor pioneering a new class of <b>combination</b> <b>products</b> assumes a central role in reducing this uncertainty by advising the decision on the primary function of the <b>combination</b> <b>product.</b> Our analysis also suggests that this decision influences the nature (pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or medical devices) of the companies that will lead the introduction of these products into the market, and guide the structure of corporate interaction thereon.

40|$|Background: Calcipotriene and {{betamethasone}} dipropionate are topical treatments for psoriasis vulgaris. Their {{mode of action}} is different. Improved risk/benefit may result with concomitant use of the two compounds together. A new vehicle has been created {{with the objective of}} obtaining optimal stability of both calcipotriene and {{betamethasone dipropionate}} in the <b>combination</b> <b>product.</b> Objective. We compared the clinical efficacy of a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of calcipotriene and betamethasone clipropionate in a new vehicle to calcipotriene in the new vehicle, betamethasone in the new vehicle, and the new vehicle alone. Methods: This was an international, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 4 -week study in patients with psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical treatment. Results. The mean percentage reduction in PASI from baseline to end of treatment was 73. 2 % in the combination group (n = 301), 48. 8 % in the calcipotriene group (n = 308), 63. 1 % in the betamethasone dipropionate group (n = 312) and 28. 8 % in the new vehicle group (n = 107), (P <. 001). The mean percentage reduction in PASI during the first week was 48. 1 %, 28. 4 %, 41. 4 %, and 21. 5 %, respectively (P <. 001). Conclusion: A <b>combination</b> <b>product</b> of calcipotriene 50 mug/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0. 5 mg/g in the new vehicle shows superior efficacy with a more rapid onset of action than the new vehicle containing either constituent alone in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris...|$|R
