5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|Addiction to alcohol, as {{with any}} <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> tested so far, has been {{correlated}} with an enduring reduction in the expression of GLT1 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens and is implicated in the drug-seeking behavior expressed nearly universally across all documented addiction syndromes. This long-term dysregulation of glutamate transmission is associated {{with an increase in}} vulnerability to both relapse-events after re-exposure to drug-use triggers as well as an overall increase in the likelihood of developing addiction to other reinforcing drugs. Drugs which help to re-stabilize the glutamate system such as N-acetylcysteine have been proposed for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are common}} drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, {{particularly}} {{among those who}} may also be using other illicit drugs. The intravenous use of temazepam poses {{the greatest threat to}} those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of temazepam with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed temazepam {{at the time of their}} overdose. This is consistent with an NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. Temazepam was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. Temazepam, including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used temazepam, 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, temazepam continues to be a major <b>drug</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross & Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of the functional consequences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> are critical as large populations are afflicted with both.

Experimental studies in animal models and in vitro clearly indicate that HIV and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> cause increased neurodegeneration, glial cell activation and enhanced HIV replication. Nevertheless, most epidemiological studies and neurocognitive studies from the pre-HAART era failed to show any evidence of combined effects <b>of</b> HIV and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, these studies provided valuable insight into potential confounding factors {{in the study of}} these populations and helped identify sensitive neurocognitive tests for this population.

40|$|<b>Drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> {{share with}} {{conventional}} reinforcers the activation of specific neural pathways in the CNS {{that are the}} substrate of their motivational properties. Dopamine is recognized as the transmitter of one such neural pathway, being involved {{in at least three}} major aspects of motivation: modulation of motivational state, acquisition (incentive learning) and expression of incentive properties by motivational stimuli. <b>Drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> different pharmacological classes stimulate in the low dose range dopamine transmission particularly in the ventral striatum. Apart from psychostimulants, the evidence that stimulation of dopamine transmission by <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> provides the primary motivational stimulus for drug self-administration is either unconvincing or negative. However, stimulation of dopamine transmission is essential for the activational properties <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> and might be instrumental for the acquisition of responding to drug-related incentive stimuli (incentive learning). Dopamine is involved in the induction and in the expression of behavioural sensitization by repeated exposure to various <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> Sensitization to the dopamine-stimulant properties <b>of</b> specific <b>drug</b> classes leading to facilitation of incentive learning of drug-related stimuli might account for the strong control over behaviour exerted by these stimuli in the addiction state. Withdrawal from <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> results in a reduction in basal dopamine transmission in vivo and in reduced responding for conventional reinforcers. Although these changes are likely to be the expression of a state of dependence of the dopamine system their contribution to the motivational state <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addiction is unclear...|$|R

Acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are the biomarkers of inflammation. Hence, the interactive effect <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> with acute phase proteins in HIV-positive subjects was investigated. Methods Plasma samples were utilized from 75 subjects with METH use, cocaine use, alcohol use, and HIV-positive alone and HIV-positive METH, cocaine, and alcohol users, and age-matched control subjects. The plasma CRP and SAA levels were measured by ELISA and western blot respectively and the CD 4 counts were also measured. Results Observed results indicated that the CRP and SAA levels in HIV-positive subjects who are METH, cocaine and alcohol users were significantly higher when compared with either <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> or HIV-positive alone.

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} {{is a public}} health and social burden. Presently, the most abused illicit substance is cannabis, followed by amphetamines, cocaine and opioids, with different prevalence in different countries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> act on {{specific}} neurotransmitter pathways and by this mechanism elicit neurochemical changes that mimic some aspects of the overall pattern of the neurochemical effects of natural rewarding stimuli. Thus, <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> are biochemically homologous to specific aspects of natural rewarding stimuli. The behavioural similarity between <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> and natural stimuli, including that of being rewarding, results from their common property of activating neurochemically specific pathways. Natural stimuli accomplish this result indirectly through their sensory properties and incentive learning while drugs stimulate by a direct central action the critical reward pathways. Many <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> mimic the incentive properties of natural stimuli and their ability to stimulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways (Fig. I). Both natural rewards and <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse,</b> including amphetamine, cocaine and other psychostimulants, preferentially stimulate dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic nucleus accumbens compared with the dorsal caudate, an area related to the extrapyramidal motor system. Although many <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> mimic the incentive aspect of natural reward, this is probably not an absolute prerequisite for conferring to a drug some abuse liability. It might be predicted that certain drugs might be abused {{as a result of their}} action at sites located beyond dopamine or by mimicking other aspects of naturally rewarding stimuli such as the 'functional' (or trophotropic). This might be the case with opiates (which also mimic the 'incentive' aspect) and of benzodiazepines, as a result of activation of the central opioid reward system and of the central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -benzodiazepine system respectively. The hypothesis appears to have heuristic value as it predicts that biochemical mechanisms important for the rewarding properties <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> are expected to play a role also in natural reward. One test of this hypothesis is offered by the observation that the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) system, through 5 -HT 3 receptors, and the central opioid system, through delta-opioid receptors, can contribute to the mechanism of the dopamine-activating properties <b>of</b> certain <b>drugs</b> <b>of</b> <b>abuse.</b> On this basis it would be predicted that drugs acting on 5 -HT 3 and on delta-opioid receptors would interfere with or mimic certain aspects of natural rewarding stimul...|$|R
