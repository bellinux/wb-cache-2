40|$|Access latency {{performance}} {{is a key}} metric in distributed storage systems since it greatly impacts user experience while existing codes mainly focus on improving performance such as storage overhead and repair cost. By generating parity nodes from parity nodes, in this work we design new XOR-based erasure codes HTSC and FH HTSC to reduce access latency in distributed storage systems. By comparing with other popular and representative codes, we show that, under the same repair cost, HTSC and FH HTSC codes can reduce access latency while maintaining favorable performance in other metrics. In particular, under the same repair cost, FH HTSC can achieve lower access latency, higher or equal failure tolerance and lower computation cost compared with the representative codes while enjoying similar storage overhead. Accordingly, FH HTSC is a superior choice for applications requiring low access latency and outstanding failure tolerance capability at the same time. Both <b>direct</b> and k-access <b>reads</b> are common in distributed storage systems.

In addition, we study the latency performance of coding and replication with non-uniform data popularity in practical storage systems. Accounting for practical conditions and through extensive simulations using real service time traces from Amazon S 3, we compare the latency performance of coding and replication and find that, different from previous results, under the same storage cost, we cannot determine easily which one is better, since it depends on many conditions, especially on whether the data popularity is uniform or not. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging microscopy (FLIM) is {{a powerful}} technique to non-invasively map the physical and chemical environment within microfluidic devices. In this work FLIM {{has been used in}} conjunction with a variety of other techniques to provide a greater insight into flow behaviour and fluid properties at the microscale. The pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, fluorescein and C-SNARF 1, have been used to generate pH maps of microfluidic devices with a time-gated camera and a time-and-space-correlated single photon counting (TSCSPC) detector, respectively. Using time-gated detection and fluorescein, the fluorescence lifetime images allow <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>reading</b> of the pH. The relative contribution to fluorescence of the acid and basic forms of C-SNARF 1 was spatially resolved on the basis of pre-exponential factors, giving quantitative mapping of the pH in the microfluidic device. Three dimensional maps of solvent composition have been generated using 2 -photon excitation FLIM (2 PE-FLIM) in order to observe the importance of gravitational effects in microfluidic devices. Two fluidic systems have been studied: glycerol concentration in the microfluidic device was measured using Kiton red; water concentration in a methanolic solution was measured using ANS. The density mismatch between two solutions of different composition induced a rotation of the interface between two streams travelling side by side in a microchannel. The experiment has provided evidence of non-negligible gravitational effects in microflows. 2 PE-FLIM has superior capability than methods used previously to assess similar phenomena. FLIM and micro-particle imaging velocimetry (μ-PIV) have been implemented on a custom-built open frame microscope and used simultaneously for multimodal mapping of fluid properties and flow characteristics. It has been shown that viscosity mismatch between two streams induces a non-constant advective transport across the channel and results in a flow profile that deviates from the usual Poiseuille profile, characteristic of pressure driven flow in microfluidic devices.

40|$|They {{have huge}} {{potential}} for application in molecular-spin-transistors, molecular-spinvalves, and molecular quantum computing. SMMs {{are characterized by}} high spin ground states with zero-field splitting leading to high relaxation barriers and long relaxation times. A relevant class of molecules are the lanthanide double-decker phthalocyanines (LaPc 2) with only one metal atom sandwiched between two organic phthalocyanine (Pc) ligands. For envisaged spintronic applications {{it is important to}} understand the interaction between the molecules and the substrate and its influence on the electronic and magnetic properties. The subject of this thesis is the investigation of the adsorbed neodymium double-decker phthalocyanine (NdPc 2) by means of low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS). The molecules are deposited by sublimation onto different substrates. It is observed that a large fraction of the double-decker molecules decomposes during deposition. The decomposition probability strongly depends on the chosen substrate. Therefore it is concluded that the substrate modifies the electronic structure of the molecule leading to a stabilization or destabilization of the molecular entity. Charge transfer from the surface to the molecule is identified as a potential stabilizing mechanism. The electronic and magnetic properties are investigated in detail for adsorbed NdPc 2 molecules on Cu(100). The results of the experimental study are compared to state-of-the-art density functional theory calculations performed by our colleagues from the Peter Grünberg Institute (PGI- 1) at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. Interestingly, the lower Pc ring of the molecule hybridizes intensely with the substrate leading to strong chemisorption of the molecule, while the upper Pc ring keeps its molecular type electronic states, which can be energetically shifted by an external electric field. Importantly, it is possible to get direct access to the spin-polarized 4 f-states of the central Nd ion by means of STM and STS. This important and unique characteristic absent for late lanthanide double-decker phthalocyanine molecules opens the door <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> <b>reading</b> and writing of the molecular spin-state by purely electrical means. In view of the intended investigations of the magnetic properties of the NdPc 2 molecule coupled to ferromagnetic surfaces, spin-polarized STM investigations of the second atomic layer of Fe on W(110) are performed. Here, bulk Cr-tips are used, which were ex-situ electrochemically etched from a Cr rod. Further in-situ treatment is shown to have no essential influence on the magnetic properties of the tips. The reproducible and reliable preparation of the ferromagnetic substrate and the Cr-tips is the basis for further investigations of the NdPc 2 molecule adsorbed on the second atomic layer of Fe on W(110). Preliminary STM and STS results give strong evidence, that the direct access to the spin-polarized 4 f-states is also feasible after adsorption of the double-decker molecule on a ferromagnetic substrate. ...|$|E

As {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) technology has revolutionized the electronics industry, the integration of nanophotonic structures with CMOS technology will also transform the sensing market. However, nanophotonic sensors have to fulfill certain requirements for their integration with CMOS detectors, such as operation in the visible wavelength range, operation in normal incidence configuration, use of CMOS compatible materials, and capability to give large optical intensity change due to resonance wavelength shift.

The gratings can achieve 1 and 6 nm linewidths for the transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) polarizations, respectively, with 90 % resonance depth. The experimental linewidth is 8 nm with 55 % resonance depth, which is limited by the detector resolution.

The currently available procedures with the highest degree of specificity and precision depend on the enzymatic destruction of uric acid by uricase.

Direct effects were assessed by comparing the ToM skills of participants who read texts that were manipulated to differ {{in the amount of}} gap filling they required. Cumulative effects were assessed by considering the relationship between lifetime literary fiction exposure and ToM. Results showed no evidence <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> effects of <b>reading</b> literature on ToM. However, lifetime literary fiction exposure was associated with higher ToM, particularly cognitive ToM. Although reading a specific piece of literary fiction may thus not have immediately measurable effects on ToM, lifetime exposure to this fiction type is associated with more advanced ToM...|$|R
40|$|A study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} prequestions (questions provided prior to reading) {{and the influence of}} a prediction strategy upon the arount and types of information recalled by children in grades three through six. Subjects, 188 students in grades three through six who were reading at third grade level or above, read a 900 -word expository article written at a third grade level. Subjects were randomly assigned to the following four groups: (1) only read the passage, (2) read 16 prequestions prior to reading the passage, (3) individually predicted answers to the prequestions in a group, and (4) predicted answers to the prequestions as a group. All subjects then completed a 32 -item posttest, half of whose questions were identical to the prequestions. Results indicated that prequestions exercised no significant impact upon the total amount of recall of the children. Gains in cueing from prequestions seemed to be offset by a narrowing in focus of attention. Although predictions did not seem to overcome the. nal) rowing influence of prequestions, prequestions with predictions did seem to increase recall on cued information without any additional narrowing of attention. than was already caused by the use of questions. Although further study is needed, prediction seems a better strategy than prequestions <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> children's <b>reading.</b> (JL) * Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made * from the original document...|$|R

40|$|By {{applying}} a scattering-wave theory, the electromagnetic response of an arbitrary array of multiple slits perforated on a metallic film {{and filled with}} different slit dielectric materials can be studied in an analytical way. Here, the wavelength-dependent splitting of a light beam into two by asymmetrically filled slits in a metal film using intra- and inter-slit dual-wave interferences is fully explored. We consider a triple-slit structure perforated on a gold film, where the middle slit {{is used for the}} surface-plasmon excitation by a narrow Gaussian beam while the two side slits are used for the detection of a transmitted surface-plasmon wave propagated from the middle opaque slit either at a particular wavelength or at double that wavelength, respectively. For this proposed simple structure, we show that only one of the two side observation slits can be in a passing state for a particular wavelength, but the other blocked slit will change to a passing state at double that wavelength with a specific design for the slit depth, slit dielectric, and inter-slit distance in the deep sub-wavelength regime. In this sense, surface-plasmon mediated light transmission becomes wavelength sensitive in our model, and a single light beam can be separated into two according to its wavelength in the transverse direction parallel to the array. This provides us with a unique way <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> optical <b>reading</b> in the near-field region using a non-spectroscopic approach. Comment: 36 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} instruction {{has evolved}} from teaching decoding of texts to teaching inferential and evaluative thinking. A well-rounded reading instruction program should provide ample time for actual reading, teacher-directed instruction in comprehension techniques, collaborative learning and student-teacher sharing of reading responses.
