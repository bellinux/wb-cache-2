5|$|The {{following}} year, in July 2008, KKR {{announced a}} new plan to list its shares. The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors {{in exchange for a}} 21% interest in the firm. In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly {{in the second half of}} 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> to close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, its executives, led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.|$|E

25|$|In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, {{established}} in August 2006 {{for the purpose}} of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.|$|E
25|$|On 11 September 1996, the Republican Society (Republikeins Genootschap) {{was founded}} at Het Prinsenhof in Delft. This {{movement}} wants the Netherlands {{to become a}} republic, but does not undertake any actions to achieve it; rather, <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> this to happen naturally if the topic is discussed often enough in society. Unlike the general anti-establishment groups, its members came from within the established circles of science, business and journalism (later also politics and education), with the abolishment of the monarchy as its specific and sole goal. At first, the Republican Society decided to operate in secret, but in February 1997, the minutes of its foundational meeting were leaked to de Volkskrant, initiating a huge national media storm. Although {{the overwhelming majority of}} initial reactions was negative, the premature revelation of the Republican Society's mere existence succeeded in breaking the taboo of questioning the monarchy by sparkling nationwide public discussion on the Dutch form of government. However, due to its exclusivity and lack of activities, several dissatisfied republicans founded the New Republican Society (Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap, NRG) in 1998. Members of the NRG do organise actions against the monarchy. However, both groups are currently relatively marginal in Dutch society: the RG does have many prominent members, but not a large following; the NRG had about 2000 members in April 2013.|$|E
500|$|The flight {{instructor}} {{was created by}} programmer Andrew Grant and voiced by Tom Streit. It monitors the player's controller input during [...] "each frame of animation". If a maneuver is attempted, the instructor [...] "interpolates the initial control movements" [...] and predicts which maneuver is being performed. The instructor then gives {{advice on how to}} complete the maneuver and offers guidance if a mistake is made. Grant believed that the code is sometimes [...] "too picky", and he stated that <b>it</b> <b>expects</b> players to perform maneuvers more precisely than is humanly possible. The team initially planned to include an online multiplayer component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area—thereby giving players the ability to compete with one another. However, the feature was not implemented into the final game. The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism. Problems with artificially intelligent judges were also a factor in the feature's removal.|$|E

500|$|For example, the {{original}} window system, called 8½, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal {{by means of}} three pseudo-files: , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, , {{which can be used}} to perform textual input/output, and , writing to which enacts graphics operations (see bit blit). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which , [...] and [...] are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input. The program does not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that <b>it</b> <b>expects.</b>|$|E
