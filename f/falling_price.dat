25|$|Like {{the later}} Great Depression, the Long Depression {{affected}} different countries at different times, at different rates, and some countries accomplished rapid growth over certain periods. Globally, however, the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s were {{a period of}} <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> levels and rates of economic growth significantly below the periods preceding and following.|$|E
50|$|Further, if {{wages and}} <b>prices</b> were <b>falling,</b> people {{would start to}} expect them to fall. This could make the economy spiral {{downward}} as those who had money would simply wait as <b>falling</b> <b>prices</b> made it more valuable - rather than spending. As Irving Fisher argued in 1933, in his Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions, deflation (<b>falling</b> <b>prices)</b> can make a depression deeper as <b>falling</b> <b>prices</b> and wages made pre-existing nominal debts more valuable in real terms.|$|R

25|$|Finch Hatton used Blixen's {{farmhouse}} as a {{home base}} between 1926 and 1931. On safari with his clients, {{he died in the}} crash of his de Havilland Gipsy Moth biplane in March 1931. At the same time, the failure of the coffee plantation, as a result of mismanagement, the height of the farm, drought and the <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> of coffee caused by the worldwide economic depression, forced Blixen to abandon her beloved estate. The family corporation sold the land to a residential developer, and Blixen returned to Denmark in August 1931 to live with her mother. She remained in Rungstedlund {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
25|$|The freedmen, {{with the}} strong backing of the Freedmen's Bureau, {{rejected}} gang-labor work patterns {{that had been used}} in slavery. Instead of gang labor, freedpeople preferred family-based labor groups. They forced planters to bargain for their labor. Such bargaining soon led to the establishment of the system of sharecropping, which gave the freedmen greater economic independence and social autonomy than gang labor. However, because they lacked capital and the planters continued to own the means of production (tools, draft animals and land), the freedmen were forced into producing cash crops (mainly cotton) for the land-owners and merchants, and they entered into a crop-lien system. Widespread poverty, disruption to an agricultural economy too dependent on cotton, and the <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> of cotton, led within decades to the routine indebtedness {{of the majority of the}} freedmen, and poverty by many planters.|$|E

2500|$|P Projects' Philipp van Stratum {{compares the}} ride system {{to that of}} The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. At {{the time of the}} ride's {{installation}} in 1999, the cost of such a system would be prohibitive for most parks. He states, [...] "the <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> of technology has made these kinds of attractions much more affordable and we can confirm that the budget for Tusenfryd is a fraction of what was paid for Spider-Man all those years ago; however we have still aim to put the bar very high." [...] Ruud Koppens of ETF Ride Systems has echoed this sentiment.|$|E
2500|$|During his presidency, Obama {{described}} {{global warming}} {{as the greatest}} long-term threat facing the world. Obama took several steps to combat global warming, {{but was unable to}} pass a major bill addressing the issue, in part because many Republicans and some Democrats questioned whether global warming is occurring and whether human activity contributes to it. Following his inauguration, Obama asked that Congress pass a bill to put a cap on domestic carbon emissions. After the House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act in 2009, Obama sought to convince the Senate to pass the bill as well. The legislation would have required the US to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 and by 83 percent {{by the middle of the}} 21st century. However, the bill was strongly opposed by Republicans and neither it nor a separate proposed bipartisan compromise ever came up for a vote in the Senate. In 2013, Obama announced that he would bypass Congress by ordering the EPA to implement new carbon emissions limits. The Clean Power Plan, unveiled in 2015, seeks to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Obama also imposed regulations on soot, sulfur, and mercury that encouraged a transition away from coal as an energy source, but the <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> of wind, solar, and natural gas energy sources also contributed to coal's decline. Obama encouraged this successful transition away from coal in large part due to the fact that [...] coal emits more carbon than other sources of power, including natural gas.|$|E
6000|$|The {{argument}} of the classicists ran thus. If there is everywhere complete economic freedom, {{then there will}} ensue in consequence a r√©gime of social justice. If every man is allowed {{to buy and sell}} goods, labor and property, just as suits his own interest, then the prices and wages that result are either in the exact measure of social justice or, at least, are perpetually moving towards it. The price of any commodity at any moment is, it is true, a [...] "market price," [...] the resultant of the demand and the supply; but behind this operates continually the inexorable law of the cost of production. Sooner or later every price must represent the actual cost of producing the commodity concerned, or, at least, must oscillate now above and now below that point which it is always endeavoring to meet. For if temporary circumstances force the price well above the cost of producing the article in question, then the large profits to be made induce a greater and greater production. The increased volume of the supply thus produced inevitably forces down the price till it sinks to the point of cost. If circumstances (such, for example, as miscalculation and an over-great supply) depress the price below the point of cost, then the discouragement of further production presently shortens the supply and brings the price up again. Price is thus like an oscillating pendulum seeking its point of rest, or like the waves of the sea rising and falling about its level. By this same mechanism the quantity and direction of production, argued the economists, respond automatically to the needs of humanity, or, at least, to the [...] "effective demand," [...] which the classicist mistook for the same thing. Just as much wheat or bricks or diamonds would be produced as the world called for; to produce too much of any one thing was to violate a natural law; the <b>falling</b> <b>price</b> and the resulting temporary loss sternly rebuked the producer.|$|E

30|$|The {{stock market}} gives {{facilities}} to gain both from rising prices {{as well as}} from <b>falling</b> <b>prices.</b> In stock markets, there are only two forces namely the bulls and the bears. Bulls are those traders who always want the market prices to go higher and gain profit from rising prices. Bears are those traders who always want the market prices to go lower and gain profit from <b>falling</b> <b>prices.</b> If bulls outnumber the bears then the market sentiment becomes bullish and we can see the market prices rising. Similarly, if bears outnumber the bulls then the market sentiment becomes bearish and we can see the market <b>prices</b> <b>falling.</b> When bulls and bears are unable to overpower each other then the market becomes neutral and we can see market prices move in a range-bound fashion, without a specific trend.|$|R
