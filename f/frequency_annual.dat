30|$|Fire frequency, area burned, {{and fire}} {{severity}} are important attributes {{of a fire}} regime, but few studies have quantified the interrelationships among them in evaluating a fire year. Although area burned {{is often used to}} summarize a fire season, burned area may not be well correlated with either the number or ecological effect of fires. Using the Landsat data archive, we examined all 148 wildland fires (prescribed fires and wildfires) > 40 ha from 1984 through 2009 for the portion of the Sierra Nevada centered on Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We calculated mean fire frequency and mean annual area burned from a combination of field- and satellite-derived data. We used the continuous probability distribution of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values to describe fire severity. For fires > 40 ha, fire <b>frequency,</b> <b>annual</b> area burned, and cumulative severity were consistent in only 13 of 26 years (50 %), but all pair-wise comparisons among these fire regime attributes were significant. Borrowing from long-established practice in climate science, we defined “fire normals” to be the 26 year means of fire <b>frequency,</b> <b>annual</b> area burned, and the area under the cumulative probability distribution of dNBR. Fire severity normals were significantly lower when they were aggregated by year compared to aggregation by area. Cumulative severity distributions for each year were best modeled with Weibull functions (all 26 years, r 2 ≥ 0.99; P < 0.001). Explicit modeling of the cumulative severity distributions may allow more comprehensive modeling of climate-severity and area-severity relationships. Together, the three metrics of number of fires, size of fires, and severity of fires provide land managers with a more comprehensive summary of a given fire year than any single metric.|$|E

Results published from {{the first five years}} of this study focused on the contrast between annual and triennial burns conducted in early spring during 2006 to 2010, and showed that burning when dominant perennial grasses have already initiated growth in the spring can reduce their productivity (Scheintaub et al. 2009), while burning when dominant grasses are still dormant does not (Scheintaub et al. 2009, Augustine et al. 2014 a).

30|$|Fire frequency, fire extent, {{and fire}} {{severity}} {{are three of}} the seven fire regime attributes of particular importance to ecologists and land managers (Sugihara et al. 2006) who closely monitor changes and trends in natural processes. Changes in fire regimes can alter vegetation type (van Wagtendonk and Fites-Kauffman 2006), species composition (Lutz et al. 2009 b), forest structure (Peterson et al. 2005), and regeneration patterns (Swanson et al. 2011), which in turn all affect carbon cycling (Hurteau and North 2010), smoke production (Tarnay and Lutz 2011), vertebrate habitat (Roberts et al. 2008), and recreation amenity values (Boxall and Englin 2008). Changing fire regimes also impact efforts to manage (Kolden and Brown 2010) and suppress fire. Projections of increased fire activity associated with climate change (e.g., Littell et al. 2010, Wotton et al. 2010) have increased {{the need to develop}} historical fire regime baselines and methods to monitor change. However, few frameworks have been proposed to help land managers quantitatively examine these changes over time or between areas. We propose a set of fire regime metrics—annual fire <b>frequency,</b> <b>annual</b> area burned, and cumulative fire severity distribution—that can be monitored on a purely statistical basis using data available from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database (Eidenshink et al. 2007).|$|E

We demonstrate this by linking natural variation in storms with measured changes in kelp forest food web structure in the Santa Barbara Channel using structural equation modeling (SEM). We then match predictions from statistical models to results from a multiyear kelp removal experiment designed to simulate frequent large storms. Both SEM models and experiments agree: if large storms remain at their current <b>annual</b> <b>frequency</b> (roughly one major kelp‐removing storm every 3. 5 years), periodic storms help maintain the complexity of kelp forest food webs. However, if large storms increase in <b>annual</b> <b>frequency</b> and begin to occur year after year, kelp forest food webs become less diverse and complex as species go locally extinct. The loss of complexity occurs primarily due to decreases in the diversity and complexity of higher trophic levels.

40|$|Atmospheric {{blocking}} in mainland Europe {{is often cited}} {{as the cause of}} extremely high temperatures lasting several days. By definition, extreme temperatures are rare, and yet the theory of extreme value statistics has seldom been applied to quantify the influence of atmospheric blocking on hot spells. Similarly, a comparison of the relative influence of other well-known atmospheric drivers, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), has seldom been explored. We applied a novel combination of extreme value and geometric distributions to observed daily temperature maxima from 74 stations across Europe, covering 1951 − 2010, to establish a stationary model of the expected magnitude, frequency and duration of hot spells that did not explicitly account for atmospheric drivers. Monthly time series of NAO, ENSO and 4 coherent atmospheric blocking regions were then incorporated as nonstationary covariates in the distribution parameter estimates to assess the dependence of hot spells on atmospheric covariates. We concluded that ENSO does not have a significant influence on hot spell magnitude or frequency; the NAO is a significant driver of hot spell magnitude (maximum attained temperature), <b>frequency</b> (<b>annual</b> event count) and duration (length of event) in northern Europe and Atlantic bordering stations; and atmospheric blocking is a significant driver of all aspects of hot spells in all parts of Europe.

This study investigates and compares the varieties of different model response of three hydrological models (PROMET, Hydrotel, HSAMI), each representing a different model complexity in terms of process description, parameter space and spatial and temporal scale. The study is performed in the Ammer watershed, a 709 km 2 catchment in the Bavarian alpine forelands, Germany. All models are driven and validated by a 30 -year time-series (1971 – 2000) of observation data. It is expressed by objective functions, that all models, HSAMI and Hydrotel due to calibration, perform almost equally well for runoff simulation over the validation period. Some systematic deviances in the hydrographs and the spatial patterns of hydrologic variables are however quite distinct and thus further discussed. Virtual future climate (2071 – 2100) is generated by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (vers 3. 7. 1), driven by the Coupled Global Climate Model (vers. 2) based on an A 2 emission scenario (IPCC 2007). The hydrological model performance is evaluated by flow indicators, such as flood <b>frequency,</b> <b>annual</b> 7 -day and 30 -day low flow and maximum seasonal flows. The modified climatic boundary conditions cause dramatic deviances in hydrologic model response. HSAMI shows tremendous overestimation of evapotranspiration, while Hydrotel and PROMET behave in comparable range. Still, their significant differences, like spatially explicit patterns of summerly water shortage or spring flood intensity, highlight the necessity to extend and quantify the uncertainty discussion in climate change impact analysis towards the remarkable effect of hydrological model complexity. It is obvious that for specific application purposes, water resources managers need to be made aware of this effect and have to take its implications into account for decision making.

Prescribed fire is increasingly being {{viewed as a}} valuable tool for mitigating the ecological consequences of long-term fire suppression within fire-adapted forest ecosystems. While the use of burning treatments in northern temperate conifer forests has at times received considerable attention, the long-term (> 10 years) effects on forest structure and development have not been quantified. We describe the persistence of prescribed fire effects in a mature red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) -dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA over a ~ 50 year period, {{as well as the}} relative roles of fire season and frequency in affecting individual tree and stand-level structural responses. Burning treatments were applied on 0. 4 ha compartments arranged in a randomized block design with four blocks. Burning treatments crossed fire season (dormant, summer) and <b>frequency</b> (<b>annual,</b> biennial, and periodic), and include an unburned control for comparison. Treatments were applied from 1960 to 1970, with no further management interventions occurring since. Data were collected periodically from 1960 to 2014. Forest structural development trajectories were significantly altered by the application of fire treatments. Our results indicate that the effects of burning treatments on structural dynamics are not ephemeral, but rather alter stand development trajectories in the long-term. Further, burning altered shrub layer dynamics and community composition both in the short- and long-term. Both season and frequency of burning were important drivers of the response of the understory, with frequent summer season burns having the largest impact, including the greatest control of hazel brush. The persistent nature of these effects highlights their potential as a tool for long-lasting structural alterations in treated stands without compromising overstory tree growth and vigor. The lack of red pine recruitment throughout the duration of the study suggests that prescribed fire alone cannot regenerate this species, and that further alteration to overstory and seedbed conditions would be needed to secure new cohorts of this species...|$|E

40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} {{measurements of}} carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations from a shallow ice core of the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling project (NEEM- 2011 -S 1). An optical-feedback cavity-enhanced absorption spectrometer (OF-CEAS) coupled to a continuous melter system performed continuous, online analysis during a four-week measurement campaign. This analytical setup generated stable measurements of CO concentrations with an external precision of 7. 8 ppbv (1 σ), based on repeated analyses of equivalent ice core sections. However, this first application of this measurement technique suffered from a poorly constrained procedural blank of 48 ± 25 ppbv and poor accuracy because an absolute calibration was not possible. The NEEM- 2011 -S 1 CO record spans 1800 yr and the long-term trends within the most recent section of this record (i. e., post 1700 AD) resemble the existing discrete CO measurements from the Eurocore ice core. However, the CO concentration is highly variable (75 – 1327 ppbv range) throughout the ice core with high <b>frequency</b> (<b>annual</b> scale), high amplitude spikes characterizing the record. These CO signals are too abrupt and rapid to reflect atmospheric variability and their prevalence largely prevents interpretation of the record in terms of atmospheric CO variation. The abrupt CO spikes are likely the result of in situ production occurring within the ice itself, although the unlikely possibility of CO production driven by non-photolytic, fast kinetic processes within the continuous melter system cannot be excluded. We observe that 68 % of the CO spikes are observed in ice layers enriched with pyrogenic aerosols. Such aerosols, originating from boreal biomass burning emissions, contain organic compounds, which may be oxidized or photodissociated to produce CO within the ice. However, the NEEM- 2011 -S 1 record displays an increase of ~ 0. 05 ppbv yr − 1 in baseline CO level prior to 1700 AD (129 m depth) and the concentration remains elevated, even for ice layers depleted in dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Thus, the processes driving the likely in situ production of CO within the NEEM ice may involve multiple, complex chemical pathways not all related to past fire history and require further investigation...|$|E

Dust devils were observed between 09 : 09 and 17 : 34, were most active between 12 : 00 and 13 : 00, and were significantly more active during the first than during the second part of day. Temperature lapse rates of at least 0. 76 °C/m were required for dust devil formation, and dust devils became more frequent with temperature lapse rates increasing up to a value of 1. 2 °C/m. Dust devil frequency remained constant with further increases in temperature lapse rate. Dust devils were observed in the wind speed range of 0. 1 – 7. 5 m/s, and showed a positive relation with wind speed up to a value of 2 m/s. For values of the wind speed higher than 3 m/s, the relation became negative.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) evaluate the long-term impact of five K rates, application <b>frequency</b> (<b>annual</b> or biennial), soil depth, and the soil K budget (net K addition/removal) on soil exchangeable K (Kexch) levels; 2) to quantify the effects of K application frequency and K rates on grain yields, and evaluate currently established Kexch critical levels for corn and soybean; and 3) to evaluate the long-term effect of K fertilization rates, net K addition/K removal, and residual K fertilizer on subsoil Kexch. Soil sampling during the growing season (0 - 20 cm) was synchronized to immediately precede the rapid K accumulation that corresponds to greatest growth rates. Post-harvest sampling was performed with a hydraulic soil probe to obtain intact cores to a depth of 60 + cm. Grain yield and grain K concentrations were measured to calculate crop K removal rates at harvest. Soil Kexch increases with net K additions varied across sites, in which differences were not related to differences in soil cation exchange capacity as indicated in the current recommendation. Within each site, the rate of Kexch decrease (as a function of the soil K budget) in soils with net K removal was smaller in magnitude than the increase observed in soils per unit net K addition. Additionally, annual K additions proved more effective in building-up soil Kexch than biennial applications. However, yield differences across application frequencies were not observed. Yield response to K additions was not observed in soils with Kexch considered limiting according to the recommendation framework. Non-linear models suggested that lower than currently-recommended Kexch levels can be risked at the 0 - 10 and 0 - 20 cm depths without significantly affecting grain yields. However, analysis of yield as a function of Kexch could not clearly identify a critical level or range in soil Kexch levels, irrespective of location or soil depth increment. Potassium fertilizer applied remained in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile. Subsoil Kexch depletion was observed at all sites, which resulted from crop K removal exceeding K rates additions. However, for near-maximum net K removals between 700 - 450 kg ha- 1, long-term subsoil K exch declines at the 20 - 30 cm depth layer were less or equal than ≤ 16 mg kg- 1 across sites. Consequently, the often reported lack of topsoil Kexch change in soils with large net K removals could not be attributed to subsoil Kexch dynamics or cycling. ...|$|E

In these invaded areas, restoration is fundamental to recovering plant community structure and function of once productive and diverse systems. Seeding is a management practice that accelerates revegetation of perennial plants in annual grass invaded ecosystems. However, seeding generally produces poor establishment and patchy plant communities that are quickly replaced by invaders. Identifying and overcoming the processes limiting desirable plant recovery should increase restoration success in annual grass invaded ecosystems. Seed dispersal dynamics, including propagule pressure and priority effects, strongly influence plant establishment and community assembly, especially during invasion and restoration because they can control recruitment of newly arriving species by influencing safe site occupation. The overall objective of this research was to identify the role of propagule pressure and priority effects on seedling emergence, plant life history, and plant community assembly. My study involved three experiments that were evaluated on seeded annual grass invaded sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in eastern Oregon. First, in order to identify the role of propagule pressure, or number of viable seeds in the seed bank, and annual grass dispersal timing, I conducted a factorially arranged experiment that tested the priority effects of seeding annual grasses in autumn or spring, adding water, and varying annual and perennial grass propagule pressure by seeding 150, 1, 500, 2, 500, or 3, 500 seeds m⁻². My results suggested that providing perennial grasses a priority seeding effect by delaying annual grass seeding until spring initially facilitated perennial grass density; however, this effect did not persist into the second-year following seeding. In addition, when annual grass propagule pressure exceeded 150 seeds m⁻², an ecological threshold was crossed which limited perennial grass recruitment regardless of perennial grass seeding rate. When water availability was high, perennial grass establishment was high because safe site availability increased, but perennial grass establishment depended on annual grass propagule pressure. These results demonstrated that restoring perennial grasses to annual grass invaded ecosystems may be possible when perennial grass seeding rates and water availability are high. However, if annual grass propagule pressure exceeds 150 seeds m⁻², an ecological threshold occurs, where, perennial grass recruitment will be limited regardless of seeding strategy. A second factorial experiment was designed to identify the priority effects of perennial grass seeding time and <b>frequency,</b> <b>annual</b> and perennial grass propagule pressure, and water availability on seedling emergence and annual and perennial grass density and biomass two-years following seeding. In this experiment, my results indicated that seeding perennial grasses seasonally split between the autumn and spring produced higher perennial grass density and biomass compared to seeding perennial grasses exclusively in either period. In addition, results supported my hypothesis that perennial grass density and biomass in seasonally split applications would be higher where perennial propagule pressure was high and annual grass propagule pressure was low. However, I found that there was a threshold between 150 - 1, 500 annual grass seeds m⁻², where regardless of perennial grass seeding strategies, perennial grass density and biomass was low. When water was added, annual and perennial grass density was higher than in plots without additional water, suggesting that higher water availability facilitates the growth of all seeded species. Collectively, these results suggested that modifying perennial grass seeding times and frequency increased perennial grass recruitment to annual grass invaded ecosystems, but only if annual grass propagule pressure was below 1, 500 annual grass seeds m⁻². Third, a life history approach was used to identify and quantify the effect of ecological processes on plant population demography when annual grass seeding times varied (autumn or spring), annual and perennial grass propagule pressure was modified by 150, 1, 500, 2, 500, or 3, 500 seeds m⁻², and watering occurred (ambient or water added treatments). In this study, we found that all species had low emergence rates, even though seedling germination was relatively high. Based on prior research, this suggests that freeze-thaw cycles, pathogen attack, and soil crusts may strongly inhibit plant growth from the germination to emergence growth stages. Alternatively, my finding that perennial grass germination rates were higher when they were seeded with annual grasses in autumn compared to delaying annual grass seeding until spring suggests that perennial grass germination is facilitated by neighboring annual grasses during this life history stage. Following seedling emergence, my data indicated that adding water enhances the establishment and growth of all species and that providing perennial grasses a priority seeding effect by delaying annual grass seeding until spring yields higher perennial grass density. However, delaying annual grass seeding until spring only provided perennial grasses a priority effect when annual grass propagule pressure was high. When annual grass propagule pressure was low, seeding perennial grasses in autumn yielded the highest perennial grass density through their life history suggesting low numbers of neighboring annual grasses facilitates the density of perennial grasses. By the second growing season, annual grass density was two-times higher than initial annual grass seeding rates and over four-times higher than perennial grass density, suggesting that annual grass interference may increase during the second growing season. Plant community assembly of restored shrub-steppe ecosystems degraded by annual grasses will likely be determined by the establishment of seeded species in the first growing season. Because perennial grasses are facilitated by annual grasses in the germination stage, and by small numbers of neighboring annual grasses in later growth stages, if perennial grasses establish in areas with low annual grass propagule pressure in the first growing season, they will likely persist to become adults. Alternatively, high annual grass propagule pressure limits perennial grass recruitment regardless of seeding strategy because of their preemptive occupation of safe sites and soil resources and high density by the second growing season...|$|E

Tu et al. (2009) showed that TC frequency over the Taiwan-East China Sea region has been increasing since 2000 because of northward shift of TC track over western North Pacific (WNP)–East Asian region. Landsea et al. (1996) claimed that the frequency of intense hurricanes in the Atlantic had been decreasing for the previous 50  years. Ho et al.

As an extension of the study by Chan and Shi (1996) after analyzing TC-frequency data for the Northwest Pacific that had been updated through the early 2000 s, Chan (2005) showed that the frequency of TCs had actually decreased since the mid- 1990 s.
