For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

25|$|Sussex {{recorded}} {{a big victory}} at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling them out twice for a pittance, which did not exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence {{a week before the}} first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 - the highest score of the English first class season so far - which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> by a bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy - who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.|$|E
25|$|On lap 173, Earnhardt {{drove his}} {{familiar}} black No. 3 car in third place, {{with two of}} his team's cars, the blue No. 15 Chevrolet driven by Michael Waltrip and the red No. 8 Chevrolet driven by his son Dale Earnhardt, Jr., running first and second in front of him. On that lap, a huge crash on the back straightaway eliminated 18 cars in a spectacular fashion. Those involved in the crash were Jason Leffler, Steve Park (another of Earnhardt's drivers), both Rusty (who would rally back to finish third) and Kenny Wallace, Jeff and Robby Gordon, both Bobby (the defending Cup Champion) and Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Tony Stewart, Elliott Sadler, Jeff and Ward Burton (who had led the most laps in the race so far with 53), Jerry Nadeau, John Andretti, Buckshot Jones, Dale Jarrett (the defending Daytona 500 winner), and Andy Houston. The crash began when R. Gordon turned W. Burton at the exit of turn 2. Stewart <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> by W. Burton, turned backwards against the outside wall, and was pushed airborne over R. Gordon. Stewart then flipped over twice, hooking to B. Labonte's hood, and stood on his front wheels before coasting to a stop in the infield, while W. Burton's car turned sideways and collected most of the field behind him. Earnhardt, Ron Hornaday, Jr., Ricky Rudd and Ken Schrader were four of the few drivers who escaped the crash scene. The race was red-flagged to remove cars from the racetrack, and clean up debris.|$|E

25|$|He {{started the}} 2008–09 season with two goals against Linfield in a {{qualifier}} for the UEFA Cup. In the 2008–09 Prva HNL, Mandžukić was the league's top goalscorer, bagging 16 goals in 28 appearances. He also scored three {{goals in the}} season's UEFA Cup. This was the season of his rise in the Croatian national team as well, as he collected eight caps in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. After the 2008–09 season had finished, he was linked with German side Werder Bremen, but the €12 million offer {{was rejected by the}} Dinamo board, who were of opinion that Mandžukić's worth was at least €15 million. He started the 2009–10 season by scoring a goal in a Champions League play-off match against Red Bull Salzburg. Mandžukić received red card in the last minutes of the game. After he told the referee that he <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> by the bottle that somebody threw from the stands, he gave him his second yellow card and ruled him out of the game. On 17 September 2009, after Dinamo lost 2–0 at home to Anderlecht in Europa League, Mandžukić was controversially fined €100,000 after being accused of poor effort. It {{was the first time in}} the history of the club that a player was financially fined. On 20 September, Mandžukić captained Dinamo to a 6–0 victory against HNK Rijeka in Prva HNL. In a post–match interview, Mandžukić rejected any speculation about him leaving the club after the fine, stating that it was his childhood dream to captain the Dinamo side and that he gives his best in any match he plays for the club. During that season, he appeared in 24 league matches, scoring 14 goals. He appeared in five Europa League matches as well.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match of}} Triplemanía XX {{was also a}} Hair vs. Hair match, contested for the hairs of Joaquín and Dorian Roldán. Joaquin led his team of Electroshock and L.A. Park into the arena, {{followed}} by Dorian {{and his team of}} Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle. The rudo team was also accompanied by Karen Jarrett, Jeff's wife and the former wife of Angle. Towards the end of the match, as referee Piero was busy keeping Karen out of the ring, Dorian entered and attacked Electroshock, which led to also his father entering the ring and telling him to get out. Dorian looked like he was about to leave the ringside area, only to return with La Sociedad member and half of the AAA World Tag Team Champions, Abyss, by his side. After a hot tag, L.A. Park was in control of his opponents, which led to Abyss entering the ring, only for Park to dropkick him out and hit him with a suicide dive. At this point, Dorian again entered the ring, but was followed by Joaquín, who dropped his son with a clothesline. As Jarrett went for diving crossbody, Park moved, which resulted in him taking out referee Piero instead. Park rolled Jarrett in an inside cradle, but Piero was unable to make the count. Abyss then once again entered the ring and hit Park with a chokeslam. He went to perform the same move on Electroshock, but <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> with a cutter instead. Electroshock then countered Angle's finishing maneuver, the Angle Slam, into an arm drag, before hitting him also with the cutter. Electroshock pinned Angle, as Park jumped on top of him, and scored the three count for the win, forcing Dorian Roldán to have his head shaved bald. However, before the shaving took place, Joaquín asked his son to disband La Sociedad and return to AAA, which led to Dorian apologizing for his actions and agreeing to disband the rudo stable. Jarrett tried to protest, but was shut down by Electroshock. Joaquín then announced {{that he did not want}} his son to be shaved, drawing the ire of L.A. Park. Suddenly, Dorian attacked his father, while Jarrett and Angle did the same to Electroshock and Park. Dorian then shaved his father's head, before leading La Sociedad out of the ring. Park, infuriated by what had happened, went to AAA president Marisela Peña Roldán, the wife of Joaquín and the mother of Dorian, and told her that she should have never let Joaquín get his hands on Antonio Peña's company.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the machine}} was {{complete}}d, the filming, using a single Steadicam, took two days to complete on February 11 and 12, with an estimated 60 takes for the machine to properly function. The first day of filming included 47 takes, none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming. Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process, {{at the start of}} the song's chorus, where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine. Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take, a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran. There were no significant injuries during filming; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end, while the Steadicam operator nearly <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video.

Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he <b>got</b> <b>hit</b> twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E
