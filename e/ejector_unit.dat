40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the construction and}} performance of a novel combined system intended for natural gas transportation and power production, and for cooling of gas transported in a gas-main pipeline. The proposed system includes a gas turbine compressor, a combined electrogenerating plant and an <b>ejector</b> refrigeration <b>unit</b> operating with a hydrocarbon refrigerant. The combined electrogenerating plant consists of a high-temperature steam-power cycle and a low-temperature hydrocarbon vapor power cycle, which together comprise a binary vapor system. The combined system is designed for the highest possible effectiveness of power generation and could find wide application in gas-transmission systems of gas-main pipelines. Application of the proposed system would enable year-round power generation and provide cooling of natural gas during periods of high ambient temperature operation. This paper presents the main results of a theoretical study and design performance specifications of a low-grade heat-driven pilot ejector refrigeration machine operating with butane and isobutane. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

2500|$|The F-111K was to {{be based}} around the {{airframe}} of the original F-111A version built for the U.S. Air Force, but was to feature a number of alterations and adaptations. Structurally, the aircraft {{would be similar to}} F-111A with the heavy duty undercarriage from the strategic bomber version. This allowed for a greater gross weight to be designed into the aircraft. The other major design change from the F-111A was in its avionics, with the design calling for the Mark II package developed for the F-111D version, which featured a new inertial navigation and attack system, incorporating the Rockwell International AN/APQ-130 attack radar, an IBM on-board computer, the Marconi AN/APN-189 doppler navigation radar and the Sperry Corporation AN/APQ-128 terrain following radar. The plan was then to pair this avionics package with British designed and developed mission systems, of which the main elements were the reconnaissance capability and weapon carriage. The F-111K was to feature a revised weapons bay, containing a new removable centreline weapons pylon, which was beneficial given the design of the underwing pylons – the F-111 had four stations under each wing, but only the inner pair were designed to pivot, meaning that the outer pair could not be used with the wings in full sweepback mode. All of the weapon pylons featured British designed <b>ejector</b> rack <b>units.</b> The aircraft was given provision for a pallet inside the weapons bay that would feature a British designed reconnaissance system, with three camera windows located next to the nosewheel undercarriage (which the US versions were not fitted with). The aircraft was designed with an aerial refuelling probe compatible with the [...] "probe and drogue" [...] system used by the RAF, similar to the one fitted to the F-111B, although mounted differently.|$|R
40|$|Ejector {{systems have}} been applied for many decades in {{refrigeration}} systems and {{this is still a}} very active field of research. More recently, ejector technology has been applied to transcritical refrigeration systems. Pressure energy recovery is particularly interesting for R 744 refrigeration and heat pump technologies compared to conventional refrigerants, since a relatively larger fraction of the cycle losses are related to throttling losses. Some of the Japanese heat pump water heaters do apply <b>ejectors</b> in transcritical <b>units</b> with R 744 as the working fluid. The new test facility of SINTEF/SUT in Trondheim makes it possible to experimentally investigate a wide range of ejectors and detailed measurement results are obtained. The design of specific ejectors is an on-going task for the research team at SINTEF. Identification of internal ejector losses are important when developing new ejector concepts. When applying CFD analysis, these losses can be identified and possibly reduced to a minimum value. The objective of the project work is to adapt a CFD ANSYS model to the measured ejector geometries. Thereafter a detailed loss analysis of the existing ejectors can be performed and suggestions for performance improvement can be given. </p...|$|R

The basic advantages of the <b>ejector,</b> as a <b>unit</b> for mixing, the simplicity, safety and which has no moving parts. To work the ejector is necessary to have the terminal consumers significant difference in effort between supply and return water heat networks, at the expense of that is getting increased water velocity at the exit of the ejector nozzle, it is necessary to create the effect of injection (mixing). Therefore, the flow of water in the local heating system will change in direct proportion to the flow of water from the thermal network through the ejector nozzle. Serious deficiencies schemes with the absence of a ejector independent circulation of water in the local heating plant. When you cut the flow of water from the heat network in the ejector nozzle, for example, the exclusion of the thermal network fault, the interrupted water circulation in the installation of heating, which can lead to the freezing of water in service. When the account pressure drop in heating systems and 15, 000 Pa usually applied ejector, and more pressure is used centrifugal pumps...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Dioxide, CO 2 (R 744) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{commonly}} applied working fluids in the infancy of refrigeration more than 100 years ago. In contrast to ammonia it mainly disappeared after the first generation of synthetic refrigerants have been introduced to the market after 1930. One reason was that the transition from low-rpm belt driven compressors towards the direct electrical motor driven compressors (50 - 60 Hz) was not performed for CO 2 compressors before the revival introduced by Gustav Lorentzen in the 90 is of last century. Since 1988 an enormous R & D effort has been made to further develop CO 2 refrigeration technology in spite of the opposition from the chemical industry. Today CO 2 refrigeration and heat pumping technologies are accepted as viable and sustainable alternatives for several applications like commercial refrigeration, transport refrigeration, vehicle air conditioning & heat pumping, domestic hot water heat pumps and industrial applications. For some applications, the current threshold to introduce R 744 technology can be overcome when the system design takes into account the advantage of the thermo dynamical- and fluid properties of CO 2. I. e. The system is designed for transcritical operation with all it pros and cons and takes into consideration how to minimize the losses, and to apply the normally lost expansion work. Shortcut-designs, i. e. drop in solutions, just replacing the H(C) FC refrigeration unit with an CO 2 systems adapted for higher system pressures will not result in energy efficient products. CO 2 systems do offer the advantage of enabling flooded evaporators supported with adapted <b>ejector</b> technology. These <b>units</b> offer high system performances at low temperature differences and show low temperature air mal-distributions across evaporators. This work gives an overview for the development possibilities for several applications during the next years. Resulting in a further market share increase of CO 2 refrigeration and heat pump systems, as energy efficient alternatives to current systems not applying natural working fluids. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
