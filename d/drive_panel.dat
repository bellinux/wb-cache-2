40|$|Abstract — The {{technology}} of {{thin film transistor}} liquid crystal display (LCD) has become more popular due to great demand for worldwide consumer electronic products. Driver integrated circuit (IC) is a critical device that is embedded sophisticated circuits to <b>drive</b> <b>panels.</b> Since narrow border design on display products is current trend, dimensions of driver ICs are shrunken. In the high-density LCD driver ICs, the operation of wafer sawing is essential and needs accurate yield assessment. However, inevitable process variance changes could arise from sawing machine, material, operation, and workmanship, {{and may not be}} detected within short time. Conventionally, manufacturing yield is evaluated applying typical yield measure index method under the assumptions that the processes are stable and normal. To assess manufacturing yield for Gamma wafer sawing processes more accurately, we present a modified yield measure index method. Using the proposed method, the magnitudes of the undetected variance change, which are functions of the detection power of the S 2 chart, are incorporated into the evaluation of manufacturing yield. In addition, we demonstrate, mathemati-cally, that the accommodation would not be affected by the scale parameter of Gamma distribution. For illustration purpose, a real-world case in a wafer sawing factory which is located on th...|$|R

40|$|In {{the north}} of Sweden, three new concert halls have {{been built in the}} last few years. The three halls are; Studio Acusticum in Piteå (2007), Kulturens hus in Luleå (2007) and Norrlandsoperan in Umeå (2002). The Acoustics of the halls have been {{designed}} by Tunemalm Akustik. There are noticeable differences between the halls. Studio Acusticum is a multipurpose concert hall where the variable acoustics is realized by a height adjustable ceiling and absorbing curtains. Variable volume is an unusual solution, which permits good acoustics without many of the drawbacks normally associated with multipurpose halls. Kulturens hus is also a multipurpose hall, but here the variable acoustics is realized by variable absorption. The walls can be changed from reflective to absorptive by a system of motor <b>driven</b> <b>panels.</b> The acoustic properties of the ceiling can also be changed. To attain very short reverberation times, absorptive curtains can be lowered on the stage and side walls. Norrlandsoperan does not have any means of varying the acoustics during concerts. It is thus a "true" concert hall, built to fulfill the requirements of symphonic music. Good acoustics is thus achieved on the cost of versatility. During the winter of 07 / 08, a thorough investigation of the acoustics in these halls has been made. The investigation showed that each hall has its own distinct character, making them more or less suitable for different music. The measurements were made in accordance with ISO 3382 : 1997, which describes the acoustic parameters used for objective concert hall evaluation. One of these parameters, Lateral Fraction (LF), was found to have reproducibility issues. Godkänd; 2008; 20080929 (ricokv...|$|R

The physical and geometrical characteristics of the system studied have been chosen {{similar to those of}} the fuselage of a civil aircraft. The total sound power transmitted by the double panel system has been used to evaluate the active control performance considering three different configurations for the control system: first, active mounts connecting the two <b>panels</b> <b>driven</b> to cancel the out-of-plane velocities at the connecting points on the radiating panel; second, loudspeakers placed between the two <b>panels</b> <b>driven</b> to cancel the acoustic pressure at specific points near to each control loudspeaker and third, simultaneous use of the active mounts and control loudspeakers systems. Also, the performance of the three control devices have been evaluated when total sound power radiation is minimised. The simulations carried out have shown that the control loudspeakers are able to produce large attenuation of the sound transmission at frequencies close to the mass-air-mass resonance of the double panel. The performance is significantly better if the loudspeakers are driven to minimise radiated sound power, rather than cancel pressure between the panels...|$|R

40|$|A Dual Layer high {{dynamic range}} LCD display can be built by {{stacking}} two panels {{one on top of}} the other.

In such a system, the conversion stage is unique due to the absence of a boost chopper. The conducted analysis leads to the interesting conclusion that the inverter used in the plant presents two degrees of freedom, easy to exploit in a control system in which the inverter simultaneously realizes the interconnection to the grid and the MPPT control. The structure of the control system is then presented, discussed and validated by means of numerical simulations...|$|R
