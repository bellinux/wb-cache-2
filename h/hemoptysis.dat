5|$|Payne's law {{practice}} {{continued to be}} successful through the early 1840s, but after suffering from attacks of <b>hemoptysis</b> (bleeding in the lungs), {{he was forced to}} curtail his activities. Instead, he devoted his time to business affairs and local politics. He began to promote the extension of railroads into Cleveland. Along with a few associates, Payne founded the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad in 1851, and served as its president. He also invested in several other local railroads. He resigned the railroad presidency in 1854, but the following year became president of a different railroad, the Painesville and Ashtabula. That same year, Payne became one of Cleveland's first water works commissioners. He also invested in real estate, and in 1888 arranged for the construction of the Perry-Payne Building in the present-day Warehouse District.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{their time}} at the academy, {{astronaut}} candidates must overcome numerous physical and mental trials. Readers discover from a pre-serialization story that Asumi's mother dies following the Lion disaster, {{but this is not}} known to Asumi's friends until Kei discovers the obituary listing in a newspaper article. Marika is revealed to be the genetic copy of a deceased Marika Ukita despite a standing ban on human cloning. Fuchuya suffers from red-green color blindness after his eyes are exposed to an exploding firework at close range in a childhood accident. Unknown to the group, Shu suffers from hereditary <b>hemoptysis</b> (coughing up of blood) and dies from the condition soon after his selection as an exchange student to the American space program. This tragedy reveals Kei's feelings for him, which she keeps hidden for much of the series.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, <b>hemoptysis,</b> impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{laceration}} {{is usually}} accompanied by <b>hemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood or of blood-stained sputum).|$|E
25|$|Some {{complications}} of treated tuberculosis like recurrent <b>hemoptysis,</b> destroyed or bronchiectaic lungs and empyema (a collection of pus in the pleural cavity) are also amenable to surgical therapy.|$|E
25|$|Lung {{involvement}} is typically {{in the form}} of <b>hemoptysis,</b> pleuritis, cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life-threatening if the outlet pulmonary artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs. Nodules, consolidations, cavities and ground glass lesions are common in patients with pulmonary involvement. Pulmonary artery thrombosis may occur.|$|E
25|$|ABPA {{should be}} {{suspected}} {{in patients with}} a predisposing lung disease—most commonly asthma or cystic fibrosis— and {{is often associated with}} chronic airway limitation (CAL). Patients generally present with symptoms of recurrent infection such as fever, but do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. Poorly-controlled asthma is a common finding, with a case series only finding 19% of ABPA patients with well-controlled asthma. Wheezing and <b>hemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood) are common features, and mucus plugging is seen in 3169% of patients.|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include pain, oozing from the puncture wounds, local swelling that may increase {{for up to}} 36 hours, bruising that spreads from the bite site, blisters, numbness, mild fever, headache, bleeding from the nose and gums, <b>hemoptysis,</b> gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, impaired consciousness and tenderness of the spleen. In untreated cases, local necrosis frequently occurs and may require amputation. In 12 fatal cases, {{the cause of death}} was sepsis (5), intracranial hemorrhage (3), acute renal failure with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis (2) and hemorrhagic shock (1).|$|E
25|$|People in {{this low}} risk {{category}} {{without any of}} these criteria may undergo no further diagnostic testing for PE: Hypoxia — SaO2 <95%, unilateral leg swelling, <b>hemoptysis,</b> prior DVT or PE, recent surgery or trauma, age >50, hormone use, tachycardia. The rationale behind this decision is that further testing (specifically CT angiogram of the chest) may cause more harm (from radiation exposure and contrast dye) than the risk of PE. The PERC rule has a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 21.9% with a false negative rate of 1.0% (16/1666).|$|E
25|$|Early {{detection}} {{of lung cancer}} is valuable. The 5-year-survival-rate of lung cancer has stagnated in the last 30 years and is now at approximately just 15%. Lung cancer takes more victims than breast cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer together. This {{is due to the}} asymptomatic growth of this cancer. In the majority of cases it is too late for a successful therapy if the patient develops first symptoms (e.g. chronic croakiness or <b>hemoptysis).</b> But if the lung cancer is detected early (mostly by chance), there is a survival rate at 47% according to the American Cancer Society.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, <b>hemoptysis,</b> hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes <b>hemoptysis.</b> Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight loss and pneumonitis have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the early}} 1890s, Demetrescu's {{condition}} worsened, and he sought treatment for tuberculosis in the Alpine climate regions of German Empire and in Austria-Hungary. In 1894, {{he was in}} Munich and later at the Rheyer Villa in Bad Reichenhall. He subsequently traveled to Vienna, where he visited the Cathedral of Saint Stephen. The following year, he was present in the Bukovinan town of Solca, where he attempted to cure his illness by living in the close proximity of firs and breathing in the scented air. Tradem's efforts were fruitless, and he died one year later, {{at the age of}} 29, after a particularly severe episode of <b>hemoptysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In later stages, {{changes in}} the {{architecture}} of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways (bronchiectasis), further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other signs include coughing up blood (<b>hemoptysis),</b> high blood pressure in the lung (pulmonary hypertension), heart failure, difficulties getting enough oxygen to the body (hypoxia), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as bilevel positive airway pressure machines or ventilators. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients. In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung disease. Among these is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, in which the body's response to the common fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with Mycobacterium avium complex, a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis, which can cause lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|He then {{appeared}} alongside Road Dogg to help CM Punk {{clear out}} The Shield in aid of Roddy Piper on Old School Raw on January 6, 2014. On the January 10 episode of SmackDown, the Outlaws teamed with CM Punk in a six-man tag match against The Shield in a losing effort. On the January 13 episode of Raw, the Outlaws again teamed with Punk in a rematch against The Shield, only to abandon Punk and lose the match, thus turning heel in the process. On the January 20 episode of Raw went {{one on one}} with CM Punk which Gunn lost. This would be Punk's final singles match in his professional wrestling career. On January 26 during the Royal Rumble Kickoff Show, Gunn and Road Dogg as the New Age Outlaws beat Cody Rhodes and Goldust to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. This marks Gunn's 11th tag team championship reign in WWE. The next night on Raw the New Age Outlaws retained the championship against Rhodes and Goldust via disqualification when Brock Lesnar attacked the brothers. The next week on Raw the New Age Outlaws retained the championship against Rhodes and Goldust in a steel cage match. On March 3, the Outlaws lost the Tag Team Championship to The Usos. Gunn sustained <b>hemoptysis</b> after he and his New Age Outlaws partner, Road Dogg, suffered a double-Triple Powerbomb by The Shield at WrestleMania XXX.|$|E
500|$|Bacterial and viral {{cases of}} {{pneumonia}} usually present with similar symptoms. Some causes {{are associated with}} classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion, while pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum, and pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as [...] "currant jelly". Bloody sputum (known as <b>hemoptysis)</b> may also occur with tuberculosis, Gram-negative pneumonia, and lung abscesses {{as well as more}} commonly with acute bronchitis. Mycoplasma pneumonia may occur in association with swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, joint pain, or a middle ear infection. Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with wheezing than does bacterial pneumonia. Pneumonia was historically divided into [...] "typical" [...] and [...] "atypical" [...] {{based on the belief that}} the presentation predicted the underlying cause. However, evidence has not supported this distinction, thus it is no longer emphasized.|$|E
500|$|Vascular malformations in {{the lungs}} may cause a number of problems. The lungs {{normally}} [...] "filter out" [...] bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT {{is the most common}} cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause <b>hemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms of {{pulmonary}} embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or {{many of the}} following: dyspnea (shortness of breath), tachypnea (rapid breathing), chest pain of a [...] "pleuritic" [...] nature (worsened by breathing), cough and <b>hemoptysis</b> (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability because of decreased blood flow through the lungs and into {{the left side of}} the heart. About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE.|$|E
2500|$|The {{medical history}} {{includes}} obtaining {{the symptoms of}} pulmonary TB: [...] productive, prolonged cough of three or more weeks, chest pain, and <b>hemoptysis.</b> Systemic symptoms include low grade remittent fever, chills, night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, easy fatiguability, and production of sputum that starts out mucoid but changes to purulent. [...] Other parts of the medical history include prior TB exposure, infection or disease and medical conditions that increase risk for TB disease such as HIV infection. Depending on the sort of patient population surveyed, as few as 20%, or as many as 75% of pulmonary tuberculosis cases may be without symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Pulmonary {{embolism}} classically presents with {{an acute}} onset of shortness of breath. Other presenting symptoms include pleuritic chest pain, cough, <b>hemoptysis,</b> and fever. Risk factors include deep vein thrombosis, recent surgery, cancer, and previous thromboembolism. It {{must always be}} considered in those with acute onset of shortness of breath owing to its high risk of mortality. Diagnosis however may be difficult and Wells Score {{is often used to}} assess the clinical probability. [...] Treatment, depending on severity of symptoms typically start with anticoagulants, presence of ominous signs (low blood pressure), may warrant the use of thrombolytic drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Ill-fed {{and exposed}} to the cold climate, Tonegaru found {{adjusting}} to the regimen impossible, and eventually fell ill with a lung disease marked by severe bouts of <b>hemoptysis.</b> His mother made repeated attempts to have her son pardoned, but did not receive a favorable reply. Confronted with his disease, and unwilling {{to be seen as}} responsible for his death, the prison officials reconsidered their plans to extend the term of his sentence as an [...] "administrative penalty", and allowed Tonegaru to go free. The poet died soon after, as a result of complications, and was buried in Bucharest's Sfânta Vineri Cemetery. Modern Romanian critic Ioan Stanomir mentions a [...] "final humiliation" [...] to which the regime exposed Tonegaru, one originally recounted by Chihaia, who was present at the funeral: the poet's body decomposed in his house during the four or five days it took Bucharest City Hall to allocate a casket, and the one it eventually sent was significantly shorter than required.|$|E
50|$|A chest X-ray {{is usually}} {{performed}} on people with fever and, especially, <b>hemoptysis</b> (blood in the sputum), {{to rule out}} pneumonia and get information on {{the severity of the}} exacerbation. <b>Hemoptysis</b> may also indicate other, potentially fatal, medical conditions.|$|E
