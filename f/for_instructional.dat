25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} neon <b>for</b> <b>instructional</b> laboratories {{is that the}} tube can be used at room temperature. However, the wavelength of the visible emission is much longer than predicted by the Bohr relation and the 18.7 V interval. A partial explanation for the orange light involves two atomic levels lying 16.6 eV and 18.7 eV above the lowest level. Electrons excited to the 18.7 eV level fall to the 16.6 eV level, with concomitant orange light emission.|$|E

25|$|The S.27 {{served as}} the basis of various Shorts {{aircraft}} which followed. These differed from the S.27 in having strut-braced extensions to their upper wings, increasing the upper wingspan by , a strengthened wing structure, and a reduced span front elevator without the sections outboard of the booms. They were powered by a 50 or 70hp (37 or 52kW) Gnome rotary engine. One (S.35) was built with a nacelle for the pilot and passenger, seated in tandem: a similar nacelle was later fitted to S.34. Some were built with dual controls <b>for</b> <b>instructional</b> purposes. Many of the aircraft built were later extensively rebuilt, in effect becoming different types.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} XP-9, marked A 028-386, {{was first}} flown on 18 November 1930. It had impressive stats on the specification sheet, but {{it quickly became}} apparent that its large (6ft chord) wing, which was placed atop the fuselage {{directly in front of}} the pilot, obstructed downward visibility so badly that simple landing maneuvers were hazardous. Test pilots at the Army Test Centre at Wright Field found that the XP-9's inherent instability was so severe that immediate modifications were requested to increase the size of the vertical tail. An enlarged vertical tail surface with smooth metal skinning was introduced, but failed to effect any significant improvement, and this revised XP-9 was grounded <b>for</b> <b>instructional</b> airframe use in August 1931, after only 15 hours of test flying.|$|E
25|$|Frustrated by poor {{conditions}} such as insufficient textbooks and dilapidated facilities during the late 1990s, students at Balboa became members of the class-action lawsuit Williams v. California. Filed in 2000 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the State of California, the suit alleged a failure to provide adequate facilities, textbooks, and teachers for the poorest schools in the state. The case was named after Eliezer Williams, a middle school student age 12 at the time, who {{would go on to}} graduate from Balboa. The lawsuit was resolved in 2004, with the administration of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger agreeing to provide US$138 million <b>for</b> <b>instructional</b> material, US$50 million for critical facility repairs at nearly 2,400 state schools, and to reimburse school districts for future repairs of deficient facilities. Estimates indicate California may be liable for up to US$1 billion in reimbursements over several years.|$|E

25|$|Tacoma School of the Arts, {{opened in}} 2001 in {{downtown}} Tacoma, is an arts-focused {{high school that}} serves as a national model for educational innovation. SOTA is a public school, part of the Tacoma Public Schools {{and is one of the}} nation's first schools to implement standards-based instruction, influencing the design of many schools in the nation. SOTA is in multiple venues around Downtown Tacoma and uses Community Museums and Universities <b>for</b> <b>instructional</b> space. In 2009, SOTA's staff expanded to a second, STEM-based high school located in Point Defiance Park, the Science and Math Institute. In 2017, the school district opened a third non-traditional high school in the same vein as SAMI and SOTA, called iDEA (Industrial Design, Engineering, and Art) in south Tacoma. SAMI and SOTA are the only schools in Tacoma to offer University of Washington in the Classroom college credit options from the University of Washington. Lincoln High School reopened in the fall of 2007 after a $75 million renovation and expansion.|$|E

[...] Langley thought it important that the work include spectral information about the colors to be cataloged, and he proposed physicist and color theorist Ogden Rood as a co-editor of the work. [...] In 1901, however, the tension between the committee's broad vision of commercial applications for the project and Ridgway's narrow objective of a naturalist's reference book ended the Ridgway-Smithsonian collaboration in the endeavor.|$|E
