5|$|The <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were criticised by some Australians, who {{compared}} them to {{the light}} sentence given to Abu Bakar Bashir, the Indonesian leader of the terrorist group which carried out the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people including 88 Australians. Both <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were cheered by some of those in court.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{government}} {{refused to}} carry out <b>death</b> <b>sentences,</b> as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and {{was regarded as a}} relic of Mussolini's Fascist regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended to meet the expectations of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General Sir John Harding, who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, {{that there should be no}} more <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> imposed on von Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while von Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952. Kesselring was moved from Mestre prison near Venice to Wolfsberg, Carinthia, in May 1947. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to Werl Prison, in Westphalia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the close}} of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947–48, charged with crimes against {{humanity}} and war crimes. Fourteen <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and two life sentences were handed out. Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.|$|E

50|$|The writ {{petition}} {{which was}} filed in Supreme Court of India in April 2013 was only against the plea that delay in execution of <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> {{should be a}} ground for converting <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> into life imprisonment. The Supreme Court rejected the plea in April 2013, by holding that in terror crime cases pleas of delay in execution of <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> cannot be a mitigating factor.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|By February 2010, {{the number}} of <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> issued had {{increased}} to at least 26, including at least one Han and one female Uyghur. Nine of the individuals sentenced were executed in November 2009; based on previous government statements, eight were Uyghur and one was Han.|$|E
5|$|Chan and Sukumaran {{launched}} final {{appeals to}} have their <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> reduced in August 2010. Chan lost his appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court on 10 May 2011 and Sukumaran's appeal was dismissed on 6 July 2011. Both made pleas for clemency to the Indonesian President that were rejected in December 2014 and January 2015.|$|E
50|$|Currently, it is {{estimated}} that there are about 5 individuals on death row in Brunei. The last known <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> was handed out in 2015, and one <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> was commuted in 2009.|$|R
50|$|In {{the words}} of Aftab Kazie and Roedad Khan, Zia hated Bhutto and had used {{inappropriate}} language and insults to describe Bhutto and his colleagues. The Supreme Court ruled four to three in favour of execution. The High Court {{had given him the}} <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> on charges of the murder of the father of Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a dissident PPP politician. Despite many clemency appeals from foreign leaders requesting Zia to commute Bhutto's <b>death</b> <b>sentence,</b> Zia dismissed the appeals and upheld the <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> On 4 April 1979, Bhutto was hanged, after the Supreme Court upheld the <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> as passed by the Lahore High Court.|$|R
50|$|The court {{sentenced him to}} 10 {{years in}} prison, but Reza Shah insisted on his <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> Major General Sarteep Sheibani (a friend of Puladeen's) refused {{to carry out the}} <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> and {{resigned}} from his post.|$|R
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's <b>death</b> <b>sentences.</b> Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its <b>death</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially incarcerated in Utah in 1975 for aggravated {{kidnapping}} and attempted criminal assault, Bundy became {{a suspect in}} a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978. He received three <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in two separate trials for the Florida homicides.|$|E
50|$|In July 2012, the Singapore {{government}} {{agreed to}} ratify {{changes to the}} mandatory <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> for drug trafficking and murder offenses - those currently on death row may apply to have their <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> reduced to life imprisonment.|$|R

50|$|The <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> in the Mellon {{case was}} {{overturned}} by the South Carolina Supreme Court because {{the jurors were}} not told that Tucker was ineligible for parole. A second sentencing phase was therefore carried out, resulting in another <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
5|$|On April 11, 2012, the Connecticut House of Representatives {{voted to}} repeal capital {{punishment}} for future cases (leaving past <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in place). The Connecticut Senate had already {{voted for the}} bill, and on April 25 Governor Dan Malloy signed the bill into law. In August 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court declared all capital punishment inconsistent with the state constitution, effectively commuting the killers' sentences to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked down hard on the rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Two {{others were}} also charged and {{found guilty of}} Brett's murder, Thomas Maguire and Edward O'Meagher Condon, but their <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> were overturned: O'Meagher Condon through the intercession of the United States government– he was an American citizen– and Maguire because the {{evidence}} given against him was considered unsatisfactory. Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien were publicly hanged on a temporary structure built {{on the wall of}} Salford Gaol, on 23 November 1867, in front of a crowd of 8,000–10,000.|$|E
5000|$|Jackson's <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> was {{commuted}} in 1977 due to {{a mistake}} in jury instructions.

5000|$|The {{local court}} judged her as guilty of sorcery and <b>sentenced</b> her to <b>death.</b> The {{national}} high court revoked the <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> However, the monarch, who {{had the authority to}} confirm or revoke any <b>sentence,</b> confirmed the <b>death</b> <b>sentence,</b> despite the high court's recommendation that she should be spared the <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> because she was old and confused and [...] "full with mad imaginations". She was described as remorseful and [...] "very devout in her prays and invocation".|$|R
5|$|After {{the close}} of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the Einsatzgruppen were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947–48, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials held under United States {{military}} authority. The men were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional Einsatzgruppe leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.|$|E
5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received <b>death</b> <b>sentences.</b>|$|E

5|$|Criminal {{trials for}} the accused {{commenced}} in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Three {{of the four}} arrested at the Melasti Bungalows, Nguyen, Chen and Norman, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. All defendants faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty. The trials were often delayed due to the defendants complaining of illness, headaches and nausea. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian government would oppose any <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> imposed.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of <b>death</b> <b>sentences</b> given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E
5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see the Thirteen as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and <b>death</b> <b>sentences.</b> To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, the Thirteen are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} reports {{an analysis}} of prosecution, sentencing, and execution data for the Republic of South Africa during the late 1980 s. The data are of special interest for three reasons. First, we document the operation of a judicial system that was administering a <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> statute that was essentially a mandatory model in cases of murder. Second, the statistics show a pattern of selectivity depending on the race of a homicide victim that is as extreme as any {{to be found in}} the world literature on the <b>death</b> <b>sentence.</b> Finally, the outcome seriously challenges the constitutionality not only of the <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> dispensation that was the focus of the study, but even more pertinently of the present South African <b>death</b> <b>sentence</b> dispensation with its wider discretion...|$|R
