50|$|Thomashuxleya {{was about}} 1.3 m {{in length and}} {{weighted}} an estimated 113 kg, with a heavy body and strong limbs. Its large skull had 44 teeth in its jaws, <b>including</b> large <b>tusks</b> {{which may have been}} used to dig around in earth. It had four toes on each foot, and probably walked somewhat like a modern peccary. It was a relatively generalised animal, not specialised for any particular way of life.There's an almost complete skeleton of this animal in exhibition in the American Museum of Natural History. This skeleton was discovered during the Scarrit expedition to Patagonia, Argentina, that was led by the paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson. Fossils of Thomashuxleya have been found in the Sarmiento and Casamayor Formations of Argentina.|$|R

Rodgers, {{commander}} of the Naval Air Development Unit, flew a Skyhook-equipped P2V to Point Barrow, Alaska, to conduct pickup tests {{under the direction of}} Dr. Max Brewer, head of the Navy's Arctic Research Laboratory. With Fulton on board to monitor the equipment, the Neptune picked up mail from Floating Ice Island T-3, also known as Fletcher's Ice Island, retrieved artifacts, <b>including</b> mastodon <b>tusks,</b> from an archaeological party on the tundra, and secured geological samples from Peters Lake Camp. The high point of the trials came when the P2V dropped a rescue package near the icebreaker [...] Retrieved by a ship's boat, the package was brought on deck, the balloon inflated, and the pickup accomplished.|$|R
2500|$|At birth, {{elephants}} have a {{total of}} 28 molar plate-like grinding teeth not <b>including</b> the <b>tusks.</b> [...] These are organized into four sets of seven successively larger teeth which the elephant will slowly wear through during its lifetime of chewing rough plant material. [...] Only four teeth are used for chewing at a given time, and as each tooth wears out, another tooth moves forward {{to take its place}} in a process similar to a conveyor belt. [...] The last and largest of these teeth usually becomes exposed when the animal is around 40 years of age, and will often last for an additional 20 years. When the last of these teeth has fallen out, regardless of the elephant's age, the animal will {{no longer be able to}} chew food and will die of starvation.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{vertebrate}} fossil discovery in North America {{to attract the}} attention of formally trainer scientists occurred just a few decades later. In July 1739 a French military expedition comprising 123 French soldiers and 319 Native American warriors left Quebec under the command of Charles Le Moyne, Baron de Longueuil to help defend New Orleans from the Chickasaw, who were attacking the city on behalf of England. While on their journey down the Ohio River towards the Mississippi, they camped in what is now Kentucky. Some of the expeditions Native members formed a hunting party and embarked to acquire that evening's meal. When they returned that evening their canoes were laden with massive fossils <b>including</b> long <b>tusks,</b> massive teeth, and a thighbone almost as tall as a person. The source of their fossils was the site now known as Big Bone Lick.|$|R
2500|$|The Middle Holocene {{occupation}} {{is associated}} with the Ténérians, who settled the area 1000 or more years after the Kiffians, 6250 BCE to 2550 BCE (8200 to 4500 BP). According to Sereno, [...] "Their crania are long, high and narrow, and their faces are taller with considerable alveolar prognathism." [...] This was a nomadic herding culture. Artifacts found in association <b>include</b> bones and <b>tusks</b> from fauna, projectile points, ceramics, ivory, bone and shell ornaments. There are also middens with remains of catfish, tilapia, hippos, antelope, soft shell turtles, crocodile, and domesticated cattle.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, a {{buyer for}} Harvey Nichols {{approached}} Leane {{with a view to}} stocking his first collection.

In 1999, Leane founded Shaun Leane Jewellery, a company producing jewellery collections alongside his large-scale fashion pieces, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern design and computer-aided design techniques. His designs are sold online and at retailers in Britain, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. Shaun Leane collections <b>include</b> Entwined, Signature <b>Tusk</b> and Cherry Blossom.|$|R
50|$|Imagotaria is {{an example}} of a {{primitive}} walrus that does not grossly appear similar to a modern walrus. However, the walrus family (the Odobenidae) is a more inclusive group, that <b>includes</b> walruses without <b>tusks</b> (e.g. Imagotaria), walruses with upper and lower tusks (the subfamily Dusignathinae), and walruses with upper tusks like the extant walrus (subfamily Odobeninae, tribe Odobenini). It is possible to classify these pinnipeds as walruses because they share many other skull features (besides tusks) as well as many skeletal features, all of which indicate common ancestry.|$|R
50|$|O. Trumper, {{the then}} {{owner of the}} site, carried {{out a series of}} {{excavations}} between 1925 and 1928, which were successful in revealing the bases of twin towers either side of the castle entrance, and a large building (containing an annexe and bailey) to the east of the castle. Evidence was also discovered for a southern tower, guardroom and portcullis, alongside a section of the curtain wall. Findings from the excavations of this period unrelated to the castle <b>included</b> a boar's <b>tusk,</b> wolf vertebra, and a Roman brooch.|$|R
50|$|The grave {{contained}} {{a total of}} seven burials: three children, a teenager and three men. Analysis of the skulls suggests that {{the men and the}} teenager were related to each other. The eldest man was buried in a crouched position with the bones of the others scattered around him and their skulls resting at his feet. They became known as the Bowmen because several flint arrowheads were placed in the grave. Other grave goods <b>included</b> a boar's <b>tusk,</b> a bone toggle, flint tools, and eight Beaker vessels, an unusually high number.|$|R

5000|$|Predatory creatures, {{including}} eagles, lions, griffins, {{bears and}} boars, are often armed {{of a different}} tincture, referring to the colour of the creature's claws or talons and beak, teeth or tusks. In {{the case of the}} boar, its armaments <b>include</b> only its <b>tusks,</b> but not its hooves, which may be unguled of another tincture. [...] Deer and moose are antler-bearing herbivores, so their antlers are not considered armaments but their attire, so these may be attired of a distinct tincture, while horn-bearing beasts such as bulls, rams and goats may be armed.|$|R
