50|$|Hardware {{is also an}} {{expression}} used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the (electronic computer) hardware from the software that runs on it. But hardware, within the automation and software engineering disciplines, need not simply be a computer of some sort. A modern automobile runs vastly more software than the Apollo spacecraft.

50|$|The West Brick School {{is located}} in northwestern Oakham, {{on the north side}} of Old Turnpike Road, between Scott Road and the Old West Cemetery. The school is a small 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof and a stone foundation. The gable ends are {{finished}} in wooden clapboards, with a window opening (typically covered by batten shutters) at the center of the south one. The front (south-facing) facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the left bay, topped by a transom window. Windows are set in all sides except the west side, which has no openings. The interior has a small entry hall, which opens into a single room occupying most of the interior. A storage space along the west wall was probably intended for storage of firewood. The interior has original flooring and walls, including vertical wainscoting and plaster. Interior doors retain original <b>hardward</b> and fastenings. The property includes the remnants of an old outhouse, and an organized roughly dome-shape pile of dressed stone that may have served as a base for a flagpole.|$|E

40|$|A method lor the {{determination}} of lightness from image intensity is presented. For certain classes ot images, lightness corresponds to reflectance, while image intensity {{is the product of}} reflectance and illumination intensity. The method is two-dimensional and depends on the different spatial distribution of these two components of image intensity. Such a lightness-judging process is required for Land's retinex theory of color vision. A number of physical models are developed and computer simulation of the process is demonstrated.

40|$|A LANDSAT digital mosaic {{data base}} for the State of Pennsylvania was {{prepared}} {{for use in the}} development of an automated system to annually estimate the extent and severity of Gypsy Moth defoliation of <b>hardward</b> forests. The techniques for detecting the defoliation and development of a geographic information system (GIS) to assess damage is being developed jointly by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and Pennsylvania State University using the JPL prepared mosaic base. The JPL processing involved the use of ground control points from the Master Data Processor for planimetric control, resampling of the LANDSAT data to 57 x 57 meter pixels, realignment to north, and reprojection to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection in UTM zones 17 and 18. The completed mosaic for each UTM zone was subdivided into 1 degree of latitude by 2 degrees of longitude quadrangles for easy data handling. Consideration is given to the issues of mapping standards, sensor and spacecraft platform characteristics, and their implication to geographic information systems operation. Methods for obtaining measures of accuracy for LANDSAT mosaics are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} new architectures for {{the efficient}} computation of redundant manipulator kinematics (direct and inverse). By calculating {{the core of}} the problem in hardware, we can make full use of the redundancy by implementing more complex self-motion algorithms. A key component of our architecture is the calculation in the VLSI <b>hardward</b> of the Singular Value Decomposition of the manipulator Jacobian. Recent advances in VLSI have allowed the mapping of complex algorithms to hardware using systolic arrays with advanced computer arithmetic algorithms, such as the coordinate rotation (CORDIC) algorithms. We use CORDIC arithmetic in the novel design of our special-purpose VLSI array, which is used in computation of the Direct Kinematics Solution (DKS), the manipulator Jacobian, as well as the Jacobian Pseudoinverse. Application-specific (subtask-dependent) portions of the inverse kinematics are handled in parallel by a DSP processor which interfaces with the custom hardware and the host machine. The architecture and algorithm development is valid for general redundant manipulators and a wide range of processors currently available and under development commercially.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{body of work}} exists {{showing that}} providing a nonlinear programming (NLP) solver with expressions for the problem constraint gradient substantially increases the speed of program execution and can also improve the robustness of convergence, especially for local optimizers. Calculation of these derivatives is often accomplished through the computation of spacecraft's state transition matrix (STM). If the two-body gravitational model is employed as is often done {{in the context of}} preliminary design, closed form expressions for these derivatives may be provided. If a high fidelity dynamics model, that might include perturbing forces such as the gravitational effect from multiple third bodies and solar radiation pressure is used then these STM's must be computed numerically. We present a method for the power <b>hardward</b> model and a full ephemeris model. An adaptive-step embedded eight order Dormand-Prince numerical integrator is discussed and a method for the computation of the time of flight derivatives in this framework is presented. The use of these numerically calculated derivatieves offer a substantial improvement over finite differencing {{in the context of a}} global optimizer. Specifically the inclusion of these STM's into the low thrust missiondesign tool chain in use at NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center allows for an increased preliminary mission design cadence...|$|E
40|$|Network {{connectivity}} {{is critical}} in Arizona, where travel distances are great, academic programs dispersed, and health care practitioners often geographically isolated. Accordingly, the University of Arizona (UA) applied for $ 50, 000. 00 in National Library of Medicine/National Science Foundation (NLM/NSF) Connections Program funding to promote statewide collaboration in supporting UA's health sciences education and research programs by expanding network connectivity to hospitals and other health-related institutions. The proposal outlined three strategies: Each major nonuniversity teaching hospital would secure and maintain a leased communications line dedicated to network connectivity, and NSF funds {{would be used to}} buy some necessary <b>hardward.</b> NSF funds would be used to establish a modern bank for dial-up Internet access by rural practitioners and teaching sites. Co-principal investigators of the project would promote and support the use of this new statewide connectivity and foster its continued expansion. The proposal was based on a conservative philosophy: familiar technologies and, where possible, existing networks and equipment would be used. The proposal was approved, and NSF funds hastened creation of an expanded health information network in Arizona. Once that network was in place, participants moved quickly from managing the mechanics of connectivity to planning for a computing and communications platform with services. Private funds were obtained to help organize the Arizona Health Information Network to direct these expanded services...|$|E
40|$|Memory {{corruption}} attacks {{continue to}} be a major vector of attack for compromising modern systems. Strong defenses such as complete memory safety for legacy languages (C/C++) incur a large overhead, while weaker and practical defenses such as Code Pointer Integrity (CPI) and Control Flow Integrity (CFI) have their weaknesses. In this thesis, we present attacks that expose the fundamental weaknesses of CPI and CFI. CPI promises to balance security and performance by focusing memory safety on code pointers thus preventing most control-hijacking attacks while maintaining low overhead. CPI protects access to code pointers by storing them in a safe region that is isolated by <b>hardward</b> enforcement on 0 x 86 - 32 architecture and by information-hiding on 0 x 86 - 64 and ARM architectures. We show that when CPI relies on information hiding, it's safe region can be leaked and thus rendering it ineffective against malicious exploits. CFI works by assigning tags to indirect branch targets statically and checking them at runtime. Coarse-grained enforcements of CFI that use a small number of tags to improve the performance overhead {{have been shown to be}} ineffective. As a result, a number of recent efforts have focused on fine-grained enforcement of CFI as it was originally proposed. In this work, we show that even a fine-grained form of CFI with unlimited number of tags is ineffective in protecting against attacks. We show that many popular code bases such as Apache and Nginx use coding practices that create flexibility in their intended control flow graph (CFG) even when a strong static analyzer is used to construct the CFG. These flexibilities allow an attacker to gain control of the execution while strictly adhering to a fine-grained CFI. by Ulziibayar Otgonbaatar. Thesis: M.
