25|$|Ryder {{used his}} {{materials}} liberally and without care. His paintings, which he often worked on {{for ten years}} or more, were built up of layers of paint and varnish applied {{on top of each}} other. He would often paint into wet varnish, or apply a layer of fast-drying paint over a layer of slow-drying paint. The result is that paintings by Ryder remain unstable and become much darker over time; they crack readily, do not fully dry even after decades, and sometimes completely disintegrate. Because of this, and because some Ryder paintings were completed or reworked by others after his death, many Ryder paintings appear very <b>different</b> <b>today</b> than they did when first created. Many of his paintings suffered damage even during Ryder's lifetime, and he tried to restore them in his later years.|$|E
25|$|Montreal and Toronto {{were well}} suited {{to benefit from the}} {{development}} of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in Quebec and Ontario, these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very <b>different.</b> <b>Today</b> New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding Halifax, but a contracting population in industrial Cape Breton, and several smaller centres in Bridgewater, Kentville, Yarmouth, and Pictou County. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and Summerside. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.|$|E
500|$|The London Borough of Barnet, on the {{northern}} outskirts of London, is mainly residential, but it has large areas of green space and farmland. The spread of suburban development into the countryside was halted by the designation of a statutory Green Belt around London after the Second World War, and almost one third of Barnet's area of [...] is Green Belt. Without this control, Barnet would be very <b>different</b> <b>today,</b> and this list of nature reserves would be much shorter.|$|E

500|$|In Groucho and Me, Groucho Marx called Skelton [...] "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and [...] "the logical {{successor}} to [...] Chaplin", {{largely because of}} his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. [...] "With one prop, a soft battered hat", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, [...] "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." [...] He added that Skelton also [...] "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors." [...] In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. [...] "It's all so very <b>different</b> <b>today.</b> The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton." [...] Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures also praised Skelton, saying, [...] "He's a clown in the old tradition. He doesn't need punch lines. He's got heart." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less {{than the sum of its}} parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very <b>different</b> <b>today,</b> if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, but it works, and the program is consistently fun".|$|E
2500|$|It was Machiavelli {{who gave}} us the modern word [...] "state" [...] and fleshed it out to our present {{conception}} of it.

This is <b>different</b> <b>today.</b> The right is based on the will of the state.|$|E

2500|$|Technology {{has long}} since left the horse-drawn King Road Drag far behind. The King Road Drag made {{possible}} {{the use of the}} motor vehicle and, ironically, the motor vehicle doomed the King Road Drag, at least in its horse-drawn form. The motor-powered road grader quickly rendered its horse-drawn predecessor obsolete. However, without the road improvements brought about by the King Road Drag in its day and the subsequent advent of the automobile, American life would be <b>different</b> <b>today</b> in ways that cannot be easily imagined. For instance, how many people living today never would have been born, if bad roads and poor transportation had prevented so much as one set of their ancestors from meeting or even meeting later than they did? With that thought in mind, how many people living in America and elsewhere unsuspectingly owe their very existence to David Ward King and his King Road Drag? ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called [...] "day care wars" [...] of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed. As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than {{was the case in the}} past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be <b>different</b> <b>today</b> than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2004, in {{the case}} of MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Grokster's favor due to its [...] "substantial noninfringing uses".

The Supreme Court decision of June 27, 2005 reversed the decision of the Ninth Court of Appeals [...] "Because substantial evidence supports MGM on all elements, summary judgment for the respondents was error. On remand, reconsideration of MGM's summary judgment motion will be in order." [...] pp.23–24 380 F.3d 1154, vacated and remanded. The Supreme Court unanimously concurred that Grokster could be liable for inducing copyright infringement. In the opinion, Justice Souter stated that [...] "he rule on inducement of infringement as developed in the early cases is no <b>different</b> <b>today.</b> dvertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use, show an affirmative intent that the product be used to infringe, and a showing that infringement was encouraged overcomes the law's reluctance to find liability when a defendant merely sells a commercial product suitable for some lawful use…" ...|$|E
