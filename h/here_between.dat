Another {{connection}} with the Philippines is that many meetings were held <b>here</b> <b>between</b> President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.|$|E

The railroad line eventually runs farther to the south of Route 57 before the route crosses County Route 519 (Uniontown Road).|$|E

The readily apparent semantic differences result from alternative strategies for interpreting the difficult verse and relate to differences in vowelization and punctuation of the consonantal text.|$|E

25|$|Excavations have {{revealed}} {{evidence of a}} prehistoric culture.

One end of the Indus Valley Civilization flourished <b>here</b> <b>between</b> the 23rd and 18th centuries BC. Later the area was an early settlement of the Aryan community. A Buddhist town once existed in the region.

25|$|There is also furniture, {{household}} objects, {{arms and}} armour, {{as well as}} the Canterbury Pendant: a Saxon silver portable sundial which was lent briefly in 2009 to Canterbury Cathedral for an exhibition. It was made {{in the form of a}} pendant, is ascribed to the silversmith St Dunstan (909−988AD), and could probably only indicate the time accurately at noon. It was used to measure the time of prayer. It was found in the Cathedral cloisters during excavations in 1948. The pendant is temporarily not on display, due to security reasons. The Invicta locomotive is housed <b>here.</b> <b>Between</b> 2009 and 2012, Canterbury Heritage Museum held many of The Beaney's exhibits during its refurbishment, including the Sir Basil Dixwell by Van Dyck bought for £1 million by Canterbury in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The current SEPTA Regional Rail {{station at}} Fern Rock Transportation Center, located along the SEPTA Main Line, {{was built in}} March 1992 to {{accommodate}} Regional Rail commuters displaced during SEPTA's 1992/1993 Railworks reconstruction project. The new station replaced former Reading Railroad stations Fern Rock and Tabor, respectively located {{north and south of}} the new station. It has high-level platforms and is handicap-accessible, being directly connected to the subway station by a ramp from the subway platform. While passengers can readily transfer between the Broad Street Line and the Regional Rail Lines at Fern Rock, such a transfer requires payment of a separate fare of the subway and regional rail, unless the rider possesses a SEPTA Trailpass, which can be used for travel on both subway and regional rail. A small track connection exists <b>here</b> <b>between</b> the SEPTA Regional Rail Lines and SEPTA's Broad Street Line.|$|E
25|$|However, {{just east}} of Blackwall, at the {{crossing}} of the River Lea, there is a TOTSO (turn-off to stay on) with the A1261 East India Dock Link Tunnel, and the road changes character dramatically, becoming a dual three-lane expressway. This grade-separated route continues {{all the way to}} the Greater London Boundary. Notable junctions include Canning Town, and the A406 junction near Beckton, as well as the single carriageway Lodge Avenue flyover near Barking, where the old A13 route (Ripple Road) merges with the new. Grade-separated in 2002-2004, the dual carriageway section through Newham is Newham Way, while through Barking it is Alfreds Way, both comprising the East Ham & Barking Bypass, and originally dualled by the 1960s. This section is structurally sound and built to high standards, but was subject to a 40mph (64km/h) speed limit. Prior to grade-separation, the speed limit was 50mph (80km/h). Works involved inserting new underpasses at Prince Regent and Movers Lane, a new flyover at Beckton Alps, and expanding Canning Town flyover from two lanes either way to three. Also inserted was the free-flow link to the A1261 tunnel. London Bus route 173 is the only route to use the A13 <b>here,</b> <b>between</b> Beckton Alps and Ripple Road. However, the speed limit was increased back to 50mph in 2011.|$|E
