The mathematical models considering the detailed synchronizer working process which can explain the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> failure, long time <b>gear</b> <b>shifting,</b> and frequent synchronizer failure phenomenon in HEV were derived.

The model of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism was developed to analyze the travel map of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> lever and the model of the synchronizer was developed to obtain the force-time curve of the synchronizer during the slipping time. The model of the synchronizer was used to investigate the relationship between the performances of the transmission and the variation of parameters during <b>gear</b> <b>shifting.</b> The mathematic models of the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> mechanism and the synchronizer provided a rapid design and verification method for the transmission with ring spring...|$|R

5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent <b>gear.</b> The foot <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> <b>selector</b> mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>shifting</b> {{strategy}} of vehicle is important {{aid for the}} acquisition of dynamic performance and high economy. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to optimize the <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> schedule for off-road vehicle by using an objective function that weighs fuel use and trip time. The optimization is accomplished through discrete dynamic programming and a trade-off between trip time and fuel consumption is analyzed. By using concave and convex surface road as road profile, an optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> strategy is used to control the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle.

40|$|Currently, most hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) equipped with automated mechanical transmission (AMT) are implemented with the conventional two-parameter <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule based on engineering experience. However, this approach cannot {{take full advantage}} of hybrid drives. In other words, the powertrain of an HEV is not able to work at the best fuel-economy points during the whole driving profile. To solve this problem, an optimization method of <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule for HEVs is proposed based on Dynamic Programming (DP) and a corresponding solving algorithm is also put forward. A <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule that can be employed in real-vehicle is extracted from the obtained optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> points by DP approach and is optimized based on analysis of the engineering experience in a typical Chinese urban driving cycle. Compared with the conventional two-parameter <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule in both simulation and real vehicle experiments, the extracted <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> schedule is proved to clearly improve the fuel economy of the HEV...|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} in passenger vehicles {{has become more}} important due to the significant increase of fuel cost and the {{awareness of the environmental}} impact. Thus finding optimal speed profiles and <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategies to cover a distance in order to decrease fuel consumption is an important issue. The optimization problem is presented and solved by means of dynamic programming and using a quasistatic vehicle model approach. Different models are presented in order to solve the problem with different assumptions. For one model the <b>gear</b> <b>shifts</b> are assumed to be instantaneous, and for another model used the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> maneuver requires a certain time. For the second model, the influence of taking into account a realistic way to compute the losses during a <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> maneuver is also developed and studied. Comparing the results provided by the two models, this method to compute the <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> losses in the optimization problem has influence in the optimal speed profiles compared to the models that do not take into account losses during the <b>gear</b> <b>shift.</b> There are two engine models used in this project, a Willans approximatio...|$|R
40|$|Older {{people may}} be advised to switch from manual to {{automatic}} <b>gear</b> <b>shifting,</b> because they may have difficulties with dividing their attention between <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> and other driving tasks such as perceiving other traffic participants. The question is whether older drivers show a better driving performance when using automatic <b>gear</b> <b>shifting</b> instead of manual <b>gear</b> <b>shifting.</b> Twenty young and twenty older drivers participated in a driving simulator study. Each participant drove both in the manual and the automatic gear conditions. Young drivers reported significantly higher risk taking behaviour in traffic than the older drivers. The older drivers experienced more collisions in the driving simulator than the young participants, but this was only true in the manual gear condition. Older participants swerved more than young participants in both gear conditions. Altogether, the driving performance of the older drivers was better in the automatic gear condition compared with the manual gear condition. This research supports the advice for older drivers to use automatic <b>gear</b> <b>shifting...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{designing}} optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> {{strategies for}} conventional passenger {{vehicles equipped with}} discrete ratio transmissions. In order to study quantitatively an optimal trade-off between the fuel economy and the driveability, the vehicle driveability is addressed in a fuel-optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> algorithm based on dynamic programming by three methods: method 1, weighted inverse of power reserve; method 2, constant power reserve; method 3, variable power reserve. Furthermore, another method based on stochastic dynamic programming is proposed to derive an optimal <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategy {{over a number of}} driving cycles in an average sense, hence taking into account the vehicle driveability. In contrast with the dynamic-programming-based strategy, the obtained <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> strategy based on stochastic dynamic programming is real time implementable. A comparative analysis of all proposed <b>gear</b> <b>shift</b> methods is given in terms of the improvements in the fuel economy and the driveability.
