40|$|First-lactation test-day yields from New York, Wisconsin, and California herds {{with low}} (11, 340 kg) annual milk yields were {{adjusted}} additively for age and lactation stage. Two random regression models with third-order Legendre polynomials for permanent environmental and genetic effects were used. The second model {{also included a}} random effect with the same polynomial regressions for 2 -yr intervals within herd (herd-stage effect). Mean adjusted test-day milk yields were 35. 4 kg (75, 838 test days in 9108 lactations) for high-yield herds, 28. 8 kg (74, 845 test days in 8887 lactations) for medium-yield herds, and 25. 6 kg (71, 996 test days in 8490 lactations) for low-yield herds. Although estimated phenotypic variances also declined with <b>herd</b> <b>yield,</b> those variances were surprisingly similar for medium- and low-yield herds. Herd-stage effect on phenotypic variance was negligible. Heritabilities for high- and medium-yield herds initially decreased and then gradually increased across lactation stages. Maximum heritability (0. 33, high-yield herds; 0. 30, mediumyield herds) was reached from 200 to 300 d in milk. Heritabilities were lower for low-yield herds but increased rapidly (maximum of 0. 22 at lactation end). Introduction of a herd-stage effect eliminated the heritability decrease in early lactation for high- and medium-yield herds and reduced the increase in late lactation for low-yield herds. Heritabilities generally were lower with inclusion of a herd-stage effect, which indicated that variances for this effect were partly considered genetic in the less complete model. Herd-stage variances relative to phenotypic variance were highest at the beginning (12 %) and end of lactation (7 %) for medium-yield herds. <b>Herd</b> <b>yield</b> and stage had a large effect on variance size and change across lactation stages during first lactation and should be considered when accounting for heterogeneous variances in genetic evaluations.

The fodder salt technique has been developed by the Tropical Zootechnical Rsearch Group at the Centro de Ciências Agrárias Ambientais e Biológicas da Universidade Federal do Recôncavo da Bahia (CCAAB/UFRB). Defined as a mixture of mineral salt and ground eudocotyledon forage hay, among them, some xerophitas species, the"fodder salt" consisting to a low cost technique with high applicability potential for ruminant production in semiarid environment. The salt controls consumption, for it facilitates the offer of eudicotyledon hay. When added to the mixture, it becomes salty, and the animals ingest it slowly and repeatedly. This behavior results in a reduction of feed intake, in less fighting among animals, and allows a better even distribution of feed for all of them.

40|$|During a 12 -month {{longitudinal}} study, bulk-tank milk {{was collected}} from organic (n= 17) and conventional (n= 19) dairy {{farms in the}} UK. Milk samples were analysed for vitamin A (retinol), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta-carotene content. The farming system type, herd production level and nutritional factors affecting the milk fat vitamin content were investigated by use of mixed model analyses. Conventionally produced milk fat had a higher mean content of vitamin A than organically produced milk fat, although {{there were no significant}} differences in the vitamin E or beta-carotene contents between the two types of milk fat. Apart from farming system, other key factors that affected milk fat vitamin content were season, <b>herd</b> <b>yield</b> and concentrate feeding level. Milk vitamin content increased in the summer months and in association with increased concentrate feeding, whilst higher-yielding herds had a lower milk vitamin E and beta-carotene content. Thus, conventional dairy farms in the UK produced milk with a higher vitamin A content, possibly owing to increased vitamin A supplementation in concentrate feeds. However, knowledge of the effects of season, access to fresh grazing or specific silage types and herd production level may also be used by all producers and processors to enhance the vitamin content in milk...|$|E

More specifically, we consider self– organized herding as the process of moving a set of individuals to a given number of locations (cluster centers) without any external control. We formally describe the relation between herding and clustering and show that any clustering model can be used to control herding processes. For the specific case of the fuzzy c–means model we derive the equations of the fuzzy c–means herding algorithm using a gradient descent approach with limited step size.

The Parmesan payment system resulted in the highest marginal value of milk with average composition in situations without herd output limitation. With aherd output limitation considering milk yield and fat content, marginal value decreased by 47 to 52 %. The economic value of fat relative to that of protein ranged from - 0. 031 to 0. 135 without herd output limitation and - 0. 432 to - 0. 020 with herd output limitation. The relative economic value of carries ranged from - 0. 012 to 0. 07 without and - 0. 020 to 0. 042 with herd output resctriction. The sensitivity analysis revealed taht the average <b>herd</b> <b>yield</b> levels for fat, and especially protein, are the main factors influencing the relative economic values.

40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{describe}} the interactions between the development of body condition in course of lactation and various descriptors of yield and fertility. Taking other investigations into consideration it was aimed to identify an optimal conditional range to be used in herd management which combines high milk yield with acceptable fertility traits and minimal health disorders. For this purpose, backfat thickness was measured by ultrasound at 46111 dairy cows on 78 different farms and was subsequently related to production variables. The development of body condition in course of lactation is influenced by parity, breed and average <b>herd</b> <b>yield.</b> Backfat thickness generally is lower for younger animals, especially in late lactation and in the dry period. With cows of third and higher parity growth effects disappear. On the other hand, those elderly animals are at higher risk of being overconditioned in late lactation. Negative energy balance is more intense and also more prolonged in Holstein-Friesians compared with crossbred german black pied x HF cows. Nevertheless those animals of high genetic merit generally manage to restore their energy reserves until subsequent parturition. In low-yielding herds attention particularly should be directed to adequate feeding and energy supply in relation to milk yield in late lactation and in the dry period. In some cases it can be beneficial taking the season-depending forage quality into consideration. Negative energy balance is getting more intense and prolonged with increasing milk yield. However a conditional nadir below 10 mm leads to decreasing milk production. Adequate feeding adjusted to milk yield seems to be a problem within herds. After depletion of nearly all their energy deposits high-performance animals are not able to restore an adequate amount of fat reserves until next parturition. On the other hand, the low-producing herdmates are predisposed to becoming excessively fat in late lactation. To reach a high production level without an increasing incidence of health disorders, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm RFD on herd average. Lower values only lead to negligibly higher milk yields but cause a distinctively higher risk of culling and an extreme energy deficit. High herd yields do not have to be at expense of reproductive performance and can be achieved without extreme body condition losses. The development of body condition in course of lactation is strongly related to the milk protein content. The average protein percentage of total lactational milk should range between 3, 5 and 3, 8 %. Values below 3, 2 % refer to an extreme energy deficit in early lactation. Dairy cows experiencing an intense negative energy balance post partum start lactation with elevated fat percentages, which decrease to values lower than average later in lactation. Intervals to first artificial insemination and to conception as well as calving intervals extend with increasing amounts of body fat losses in early lactation. Those animals losing the largest amounts of body fat and showing the longest intervals to conception conceive again about two months after returning to positive energy balance. On the other hand, those with only slight energy deficit become pregnant again around nadir of body condition. To achieve profitable reproductive performance, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm RFD on herd average, body fat loss in the first 4 weeks p. p. should not increase above 0, 14 mm per day. Body condition in the dry period and around parturition has a stronger influence on milk yield and solids in early lactation than on total lactational yield. Independent of dairy merit mean body condition in the dry period should range between 22 and 24 mm. Those cows show high reproductive efficiency and low culling risks later on. Condition scores above 35 mm RFD have to be avoided because of the highly increasing culling risk as well as decreasing milk production. Simultaneously excessive body fat reserves lead to longer intervals to first insemination. Conditional nadir should reach about 13 mm RFD. Lower values can increase individual milk yield related to herd average but at expense of higher culling risks and lower reproductive performance. Dairy cows should return to positive energy balance after a 100 days in milk maximum and another 100 days later a distinct regeneration of body fat reserves should be realised. At drying off, animals should have regained calving condition. However high producing dairy cows moderately have to gain body condition in the dry period, because replenishment of body energy reserves during late lactation becomes increasingly difficult. The validity of body condition scoring is limited concerning the individual, but it is a powerful management tool to assess the nutritional status of a dairy herd. It is a practical instrument in controlling the physiological loss of body fat reserves in early lactation and to allow the cow an adequate replenishment of body tissue reserves in anticipation of the subsequent lactation. An efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility, which commonly is combined with an increasing milk yield. Standard curves throughout lactation to be used in dairy herd management are in figure 57 and 58...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{significant}} disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle and is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare concern. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. This study examined the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment in the prevention of mastitis and quantified the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had on the number of clinical cases of mastitis on somatic cell counts within herds. Context and background Organic dairy farming is a significant industry with milk being the largest single organic product in the UK. Organic milk is produced to defined standards which meet the Advisory Committee on Organic Standards (ACOS) criteria. These standards ‘emphasise animal welfare and, by avoiding artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other non-natural chemicals, and prohibiting the routine use of antibiotics and other conventional drugs, also ensure care for the environment, and promote the highest standards of food quality and safety’ (Omsco 2005). As part of the management of organic dairy cattle with reduced use of conventional pharmaceutical treatments, many organic farmers use homeopathic and other complementary therapies on their animals. Mastitis is recognised as the main animal health problem in organic milk production systems (Bennedsgaard et al 2003). Whilst mastitis levels appear to be similar to those found in conventional production (Hovi and Roderick, 2000) specific problem areas in mastitis control under organic management standards have been identified. One of the overall goals of organic animal husbandry is to avoid disease through management, husbandry, breeding and feeding. According to the EC-Regulation No. 1804 / 1999 governing organic livestock production, animal health management should be based on disease prevention. However, the preventive use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products like dry cow antibiotics is not permitted. In organic units, phytotherapeutic and homeopathic products and trace elements are to be used in preference to antibiotic and prolonged withdrawal periods need to be observed after conventional medicine use. As a consequence of these requirements, organic dairy farmers look for alternatives to conventional therapy and prophylaxis (Hektoen 2004). Homeopathy is widely used for the treatment of mastitis within UK organic dairy herds and prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes, either continuously or just during housing, is practised on many organic dairy farms and is thought to offer general protection against mastitis and to reduce somatic cell counts (SCC). Research into the effectiveness of homeopathic treatments {{was one of the most}} important research requirements identified in a recent MAFF review of animal health within organic herds (Hovi & Roderick 1999). The range of homeopathic treatments used on farm today is wide, with treatment practices either focussing on the needs of the individual animal, which is known as constitutional treatment and which employs individual remedies, or aimed at groups of animals using specific remedies, or ‘nosodes’, which are considered to be a very specific form of homeopathy - isopathy (iso - all the same, pathy – treatment/exposure). Unlike specific remedies, nosodes do not account for the individual needs of each animal, but create the potential for protective treatment for a herd or group, they are generally applied in drinking water, and may be used on individual animals, usually by vulval spray. Benefit for the sector and for Defra Mastitis {{is the most}} significant disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle, and management and control of mastitis is an important facet of practical dairy herd management. Mastitis is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare problem in dairy cattle. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. The Study Ninety-six farms participated in a double-blind trial to compare a homeopathic nosode and an inactive control treatment (carrier alone). Treatments were at the farm level and took place over a period of 12 months or 24 months (some farms were swapped to the opposite treatment during a second year). The treatments were randomised to each farm by a third party. During the trial, where available, records were collected of farm monthly bulk tank somatic cell count (BMSSC), a monthly cell count based on National Milk Recording data (NMR) and the annual number of cases of mastitis as recorded by the farmer. Additional farm level data were collected and their relationship to the level of mastitis on the farms investigated. Objectives of the Study The study described in this report explores the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment, a nosode, in the prevention of mastitis and quantifies the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had in reducing the number of clinical cases of mastitis and also quantifying any effect that the use of a nosode has on somatic cell counts within herds. •	To quantify the effectiveness of the prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes for the treatment of mastitis in reducing the incidence of clinical mastitis and the concentration of somatic cells in milk. •	To survey management practices on organically managed farms. •	To investigate associations between the homeopathic treatment, farm management practice and the incidence of different types of mastitis and to provide guidance for mastitis control in organic dairy herds. Materials and methods In testing the efficacy of a homeopathic nosode it was determined that the study should: •	Look at a nosode already being commonly used and commercially available. •	Not ask for new recording systems to be used for data collection but to use the existing systems which are in place. •	Not interfere in the ‘normal’ practises carried out by the farms, by, for example, repeated prompting of farmers to carry out treatments, or ask them to adopt prescribed ways for describing, recording or treating mastitis. There are three commonly used measures of the udder health of milking cows: a) 	The bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC, commonly referred to as SCC) gives a count (in 000 ’s cells / ml) of white cells and desquamated cells shed by the udder. The BMSCC is not an accurate indicator for the presence of clinical mastitis, but may give information on sub-clinical (undetected) mastitis. b) 	Somatic cell counts for individual cows from farms which subscribe to commercial milk recording services (ICSCC). c) 	The number of cases of mastitis. The incidence rate for clinical mastitis (IRCM) is the number of distinct cases of mastitis in 100 cows in a year. The response variables that were measured were: •	Farmers’ own record of mastitis cases. •	Bulk milk SCC. •	Individual cow somatic cell records (ICSCC) if the farms were on a milk recording service. •	Farmer’s opinion of his/her success in controlling mastitis. •	A large number of variables, recorded using a questionnaire at the farm visits, which could influence mastitis and the effectiveness of the treatment. After visiting a number of homeopathic pharmacies, an agreement was made with Crossgates homeopathic pharmacy 1, and Freemans Homeopathic Pharmacy 2 (Appendix D) to make the individual herd specific nosode remedies for the farms. The trial was double-blinded, with blinding carried out by the creation of a randomly generated list of A and B’s. As each new farm was recruited, it was allocated to the next A or B in the sequence, the farms being allocated to either nosode treatment or control, one by one, in chronological order. Articles were written in the organic press, Organic Farming, and The Turning Worm, inviting farms to take part in the study. It was clear that farms should only join the study voluntarily and would not be ‘cold called’ or pressurised to join. One hundred and four farms responded to the call, and 96 of these farms went on to take part in the study. The 8 farms which declined to take part either went out of milk production before the study started, or changed their minds about inclusion in the trial before the start of the study. The 96 farms were visited and the study introduced. Farmers were issued with a kit to collect milk from high cell count cows for preparation as a nosode. An 80 part questionnaire (Appendix A) was used to gather the information needed to understand the possible factors that may influence mastitis. During visits the farmers were also asked whether they were willing to fill in a self assessment of their personality type. Number of farms recruited 			= 96 Total farms completing the study period	= 88 Number of farm years followed		= 206 Average herd size			= 101 cows Number of cows followed in the study 	= 9, 680 Number of cows receiving remedy (R) 	= 4, 734 Number of cows receiving control (P) 	= 4, 946 Total cow years followed			= 21, 580 cow years (Some farms two years, some 3 years) Farms lost during study			= 8 (due to sale of the herd, or going out of milk production and into, for example, heifer rearing) Results The data collected were subject to a number of different analyses:- 1. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the cell count in milk. 2. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the annual cases of mastitis. 3. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with increased cell count in milk. 4. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with higher levels of mastitis. No effect of nosode in reducing either the incidence of cases of mastitis or the somatic cell counts in the milk were detected. The following risk factors were found to be associated with composite cell counts:- •	A decrease in cell count with increased culling of high cell count cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use complementary therapies on dry cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use dry cow therapy, including teat sealants, on dry cows •	An increased cell count for farms which did not pre-wipe before milking or pre-wiped the teats with a cloth before milking •	An increase in cell count for farms which pre-wipe only the udders of cows which are visibly dirty before milking The following risk factors were found to be associated with the number of cases of mastitis:- •	Increasing <b>herd</b> <b>yield</b> is associated with increased mastitis case numbers •	Increased calving of cows indoors in a calving box was associated with increased numbers of mastitis cases •	Use of an in line clot filer was associated with reduced numbers of mastitis cases •	Having an abreast parlour (as opposed to a herringbone or rotary parlour) was associated with a reduced numbers of mastitis cases The extent to which the objectives set have been achieved The effectiveness of homeopathic nosodes in treating mastitis and lowering cell count is quantified and described (Objective 1) and the survey results of management practices on organically managed dairy farms are described (Objective 2). Additionally, the associations between homeopathic treatment, farm management practices, mastitis incidence and cell count are quantified (Objective 4) and management controls which show a reduction in mastitis cases or cell counts are identified as risk factors and described in the report (Objective 5). Conclusions •	There was no significant effect of the herd specific nosode on either the cell count of milk or the number of cases of mastitis. •	That there were strong ‘within farm’ correlations of cell count and cases i. e. between farms, farms tend to stay at the same level of cases and average cell count from year to year. •	That there was a characteristic pattern of seasonal change in cell counts (this is already widely recognised). •	The study provides useful and interesting statistics on organic dairy farm production. •	The study identified an association between decreased cell count and culling for high cell count, the use of complementary dry cow therapy and the use of traditional dry cow therapy. •	The study identified an association between increased cell count and not pre-wiping the udder, pre-wiping using a cloth and only pre-wiping dirty cows. •	The study identified an association between higher numbers of mastitis cases and higher average yield and also with higher percentage of cows calving in a calving box. •	An association was identified between decreased numbers of mastitis cases and the use of an in-line clot filter and also with farms with an abreast parlour (rather than a herring-bone parlour). •	Eighty five per cent of farmers in the survey responded that they did believe in non-conventional remedies, and 62 per cent of farmers responded that they used non-conventional remedies on their own family. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a stochastic simulation model {{to compare the}} herd sensitivity (HSe) of five testing strategies for detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) in Midwestern US dairies. Testing strategies were ELISA serologic testing by two commercial assays (EA and EB), ELISA testing with follow-up of positive samples with individual fecal culture (EAIFC and EBIFC), individual fecal culture (IFC), pooled fecal culture (PFC), and culture of fecal slurry samples from the environment (ENV). We assumed that these dairies had no prior paratuberculosis-related testing and culling. We used cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis to compare the cost to HSe of testing strategies for different within-herd prevalences. HSe was strongly associated with within-herd prevalence, number of Map organisms shed in feces by infected cows, and number of samples tested. Among evaluated testing methods with 100 % herd specificity (HSp), ENV was the most cost-effective method for herds with a low (5 %), moderate (16 %) or high (35 %) Map prevalence. The PFC, IFC, EAIFC and EBIFC were increasingly more costly detection methods. Culture of six environmental samples per <b>herd</b> <b>yielded</b> ≥ 99 % HSe in herds with ≥ 16 % within-herd prevalence, but was not sufficient to achieve 95 % HSe in low-prevalence herds (5 %).

40|$|Title of the paper: Body {{condition}} and metabolic stability as basis of high milk yield, reproductive performance, and general health in dairy cows The target {{of this study}} was to describe the interactions between body {{condition and}} various descriptors of yield and fertility. It was aimed to identify an optimal conditional range to be used in herd management which combines high milk yield with acceptable fertility traits and general health. For this purpose, backfat thickness was measured by ultrasound at 46111 dairy cows on 78 different farms and was subsequently related to production variables. Negative energy balance is getting more intense and prolonged with increasing milk yield. However a conditional nadir below 10 mm leads to decreased milk production. To reach a high production level without an increasing incidence of health disorders, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm backfat thickness on herd average. Lower value only lead to negligibly higher milk yield but cause a distinctively higher risk of fertility problems and culling. High <b>herd</b> <b>yields</b> do not have to be at expense of reproduction performance and can be achieved without extreme body condition losses. An efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility, which commonly is combined with increasing milk yield. It is suggested a standard curve for backfat thickness throughout lactation to be used in dairy herd management...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the suitability of 3 different modeling techniques for the prediction of total daily <b>herd</b> milk <b>yield</b> from a <b>herd</b> of 140 lactating pasture-based dairy cows over varying forecast horizons. A nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous input, a static artificial neural network, and a multiple linear regression model were developed using 3 yr of historical milk-production data. The models predicted the total daily <b>herd</b> milk <b>yield</b> over a full season using a 305 -d forecast horizon and 50 -, 30 -, and 10 -d moving piecewise horizons to test the accuracy of the models over long- and short-term periods. All 3 models predicted the daily production levels for a full lactation of 305 d with a percentage root mean square error (RMSE) of ≤ 12. 03 %. However, the nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous input was capable of increasing its prediction accuracy as the horizon was shortened from 305 to 50, 30, and 10 d [RMSE (%) = 8. 59, 8. 1, 6. 77, 5. 84], whereas the static artificial neural network [RMSE (%) = 12. 03, 12. 15, 11. 74, 10. 7] and the multiple linear regression model [RMSE (%) = 10. 62, 10. 68, 10. 62, 10. 54] were not able to reduce their forecast error over the same horizons to the same extent. For this particular application the nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous input can be presented as a more accurate alternative to conventional regression modeling techniques, especially for short-term milk-yield predictions...|$|R
40|$|Anaplasma marginale {{infection}} in Europe {{has been limited}} to the Mediterranean and eastern countries, to Austria and to very sporadic cases in Switzerland. There are no reports of its occurrence in the countries north of Switzerland. A severe outbreak of anaplasmosis in August 2002 in a cattle farm in the canton Grisons, Switzerland, north of the Alps, with more than 300 cattle {{that had to be}} culled, came unexpected and gave reason to hypothesize presence of an increased yet undetected prevalence of A. marginale in Switzerland. Randomly selected bovine serum samples collected in 1998 and 2003 were tested using a competitive inhibitory ELISA (cELISA) to test the hypothesis. Our validation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this test, done in the outbreak <b>herd,</b> <b>yielded</b> 99. 2 and 83. 3 %, respectively, probably underestimating the true specificity. The true seroprevalence of anaplasmosis in Swiss cattle determined by cELISA was likely to be zero with upper 95 % confidence limits of 2. 49 % in the canton Grisons and 1. 17 % in the rest of Switzerland, respectively, in 1998. For 2003, these estimates were even lower. There {{was no significant difference in}} apparent prevalences between 1998 and 2003. In search of a possible reservoir, three chamoises out of 46 free ranging wild ruminants from the Swiss National Park, Grisons, tested positive in the cELISA.

40|$|A herd-based {{survey of}} Salmonella in pigs was {{carried in a}} major pig {{producing}} region of Spain. Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from the carcasses of 25 pigs from each of 80 herds at time of slaughter. Salmonella spp. were isolated from 31 % of animals and 94 % of herds. Within-herd prevalence ranged from 4 to 88 %, with the prevalence in most herds being greater than 10 %. A large diversity of Salmonella serotypes was found, with Typhimurium, 4,[5], 12 :i: 2, and Rissen being the most prevalent. Two or more serotypes coexisted in 73 % of the herds. Salmonella Typhimurium was present in 68 % of the herds. Most (82 %) of the Salmonella isolates belonged to serogroups targeted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for pig salmonellosis. Resistance {{to at least one}} antimicrobial agent was detected in 73 % of the strains, and one or more resistant strains were recovered from pigs in 93 % of the herds. Antimicrobial agent resistance (AR) was more frequent among the most prevalent than it was among the rarer serotypes. Twenty-five multi-AR patterns were found. Resistance to three or more families of antimicrobial agents was found in 75 % of AR strains. The finding that many of the <b>herds</b> <b>yielded</b> isolates of several multi-AR patterns indicates that Salmonella infections were acquired from multiple sources. High prevalence of Salmonella in herds was associated with lack of rodent control programs, herds from farms with only finishing pigs, herds managed by more than one full-time worker, herds for which the source of drinking water was not a city supply, and relatively long fattening times. © International Association for Food Protection.

Predicted yields were compared with actual measurements. If the error of prediction, or innovation, exceeded ± 2 times its standard deviation, the observation was considered to be significantly different from the former yield level. The data comprised 30, 199 records for 135 cows and 366 d. Effects fitted in the model were test day, breed, and lactation class as fixed effects and cow within lactation number as a random effect. A lactation curve was fitted within lactation class. Of the observed milk yields, 9. 2 % deviated significantly from the expected value in a negative direction. None of the innovation of the fixed-day effect exceeded the threshold of two standard deviations. Compared with the results of rolling average, which were calculated as the average of a 10 -d period, over 20 % of the observations of the daily milk yield were classified differently by the two methods. The mixed-model method for recursive estimation takes better account of environmental and lactational effects influencing daily milk yields as the rolling average. The mixed-model recursive estimation method was applicable for the detection of suspicious (i. e., outside a specified prediction interval) observations of individual cows {{at the time of the}} actual recording.

Whereas, most of the cattle farming in the country is carried out in rural areas, where 5 - 6 million rural households keeps cattle for draft power and use milk as a by product for family consumption or sale. In case of buffaloes, lactation milk yield per milking female range from about 1350 liters in rural subsistence house holds to 3450 liters in commercial peri-urban operations. Similarly, in case of cows, the lactation yield range from a low of 450 liters in barani areas to 1800 liters in the peri-urban milk producing units and to 2500 liters obtained by the progressive farmers.

Traits analyzed were age at first calving (n = 4631), days to first breeding, and days open (n = 1992) during the first lactation. A proportional hazard model was used that included fixed effects of herd-year, year-season, breed type, herd weight, and heifer weight. Body weights were recorded at 390 d of age, on average. The model for days open and days to first breeding included two additional fixed effects of herd and heifer milk yield at 100 d. A significant effect of heifer weight category on age at first calving was found. The chance of calving was consistently higher for herds and heifers with higher body weight at 390 d and decreased linearly from the top to the lowest quartiles. The effects of herd weight category on days to first breeding and days open were significant. Heifers in herds with a higher average body weight {{were less likely to}} be bred, and heifers in herds with lower average body weight were less likely to get pregnant.

40|$|Pain is an {{important}} indicator of poor welfare of livestock. Despite this, pain has largely gone unrecognized in farm animals due to attitudes of producers and veterinarians, although they {{play a key role}} in monitoring and managing the perception of animal pain. Producer attitudes toward animal welfare influence livestock management and production. The aim was to quantify dairy producer attitudes to the painfulness of various cattle diseases and disbudding, a painful routine procedure performed on farm to ensure safer handling of cattle. A questionnaire on disbudding-related opinions and practices was sent to 1, 000 Finnish dairy producers (response rate: 45 %). Attitudes toward disbudding were gauged using a 5 -point Likert scale and attitudes to cattle pain scored on an 11 -point numerical rating scale. Principal components analysis was used to assess the loadings, which were further tested for differences between producer gender and housing systems with Mann-Whitney U-tests, and between <b>herd</b> milk <b>yield,</b> <b>herd</b> size, and age and work experience of producers with a Kruskal-Wallis test. Four main factors were identified: factor I (“taking disbudding pain seriously”), factor II (“sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases”), factor III (“ready to medicate calves myself”), and factor IV (“pro horns”). Female producers took disbudding pain more seriously, were more sensitive to pain caused to cattle by diseases, and were more ready to medicate disbudded calves than male producers. Producers with tie-stalls favored horns over producers with freestalls. Male producers with tie-stalls were sensitive to cattle pain and preferred horns over male producers with freestalls. Female producers with freestalls were more ready to medicate calves, but did not prefer horns more than female producers with tie-stalls. Taking disbudding seriously correlated with sensitivity to pain caused by cattle diseases. Producers with low-milk-yielding herds were less willing to medicate calves and more willing to keep cattle with horns than producers with higher-yielding herds. Older producers were more sensitive to cattle pain than middle-aged and younger producers. No effect was established for taking disbudding pain seriously: the pro-horn factor was associated with work experience, age, and herd size. Women rated pain higher and were more positive toward pain medication for animals than men. Maintaining horns are more important for producers with tie-stalls than for those with freestalls...|$|R
40|$|High {{lactating}} cows fall more frequently, that is {{the main}} view yet. Research in literature brought {{a high number of}} journal essays and proceedings picking it out as a central theme. The results and views of the authors could not be more different. They vary from milk yield stimulates fertility and health positively or no existing relation to significant antagonistic relations. The Clinic for Ruminants and Pigs of the Free University Berlin introduced a database in 1995. It contains 3925 sets (until 2010) of 743 visits on 489 farms in 6 federal countries of Germany. These visits took place by request of the farms. A survey of herd specific data like milk yield and fertility as well as possible herd problems was made and therefore samples of blood, urine, hair and food have been taken. Furthermore back fat thickness was measured. To answer the question which parameter (year, country, <b>herd</b> size, milk <b>yield)</b> influences the animal heath and fertility, the data base was analysed on possibly relations under special consideration of milk yield as well as the data collected in anamnesis. Calculations of correlations, regressions and some more tests have been done by using different statistical procedures. As a result of this interpretation an antagonistic relation could only be found for the fertility. The health of udder, metabolism and claws is not or even favourable linked with the milk yield. All variables set into relation with milk yield were analysed as well on a link to herd size, location and year of sampling. This resulted partly in significant correlations which is an allusion to the environmental dependency of the parameters. Summing up this thesis comes to the conclusion that a high milk yield is not the only cause for the growing number of herd problems or insufficient fertility rates. Moreover the healthy herds have the higher milk yield. A high milk yield should be seen as an indicator of animal health (BUSCH, 2004). Thus, the maintaining of herd health by an animal-friendly environment and a conscientious management is of out most importance whereat the level grows with higher <b>herd</b> milk <b>yield...</b>|$|R

Although reranking of dairy sires based on the level of feeding of their daughters has been reported, detecting the genetic mutations that cause this genotype by environment interaction has not been previously attempted. In our experiment to find genetic markers for such mutations, we selected 388 Holstein bulls from the Australian dairy bull population and genotyped them for 9, 919 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Production data, consisting of first-lactation test-day records for milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, protein percentage, and fat percentage, from the daughters of the genotyped bulls were used to estimate the effect of each SNP, which was modeled as a regression on <b>herd</b> mean test-day <b>yield,</b> where <b>herd</b> mean test-day <b>yield</b> is a descriptor of the environment. Data were analyzed with 4 models; in 2 models, daughter records were analyzed directly, with and without taking sire relationships into account.

The results showed that using daughter records directly and accounting for sire relationships was necessary to obtain high power and {{to limit the number of}} false positives. With this approach, SNP with significant effects were found for all traits. Log transformation of the data did not affect the power of gene detection.
