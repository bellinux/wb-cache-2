500|$|As the Nixon {{presidency}} slowly collapsed, Voorhis {{spoke out}} more frequently. In 1972, he said, [...] "Sour grapes {{to criticize the}} man who beat me, but I just wouldn't be human <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I liked spending {{the second half of}} my life as 'the man who Nixon beat'". After Nixon resigned as President, Voorhis, noted, [...] "Here is the philosophy of doing-anything-to-win receiving its just and proper reward." [...] Voorhis, believing he had been labeled a subversive by Nixon, [...] "took some satisfaction" [...] in stating that Nixon himself had been the subversive, seeking, according to Voorhis, to impose [...] "a virtual dictatorship" [...] on the country.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the album's release, musicians {{who had worked with}} Idol in the past were asked to comment on the failure of Cyberpunk. Tony James of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, a pop-cyberpunk band, and former bassist for Generation X, weighed in. Though sympathetic to his former band mate, he felt the stylistic change didn't fit Idol. [...] "Billy is always cool but he does Billy Idol rebel yellin the best, i felt cyberpunk was a wrong turning for him..he has his sound..stay great as u are Bill..." [...] In 2001 Steve Stevens was asked if Idol's declining popularity and the failure of Cyberpunk was related to their split. Stevens rejected the idea, saying of the failed album, [...] "I think the Cyberpunk record people didn't get. I think I would be doing Billy and his fans a great disservice <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that he needed me for his popularity." ...|$|E

The two teams had played {{each other in a}} scrimmage in the preseason. They had also met in the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament when the Owls earned an 84–72 victory in the Sweet Sixteen. Coming into the game, Fran Dunphy had a NCAA tournament record 11-game losing streak, at Penn and Temple Owls. [...] "I probably think about it less than others do," [...] said Dunphy, [...] "but you think about it. I would be lying <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I didn't.

500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
500|$|Havers {{returned}} to Coronation Street on 17 February 2012. While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis would have a lot of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that it was wonderful to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— as you can imagine. And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E

500|$|The Dark Knight was {{nominated}} for eight Academy Awards for the 81st Ceremony, breaking the previous record of seven held by Dick Tracy for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip, or graphic novel. The Dark Knight won two awards: Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger and Best Sound Editing. It was additionally nominated for six others, these being Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Film Editing. Heath Ledger was the first posthumous winner of the Best Supporting Actor award, and only the second posthumous acting winner ever (Peter Finch posthumously won the Best Actor award for his performance in the 1976 film Network). In addition, Ledger's win marked the first win {{in any of the}} major Oscar categories (producing, directing, acting, or writing) for a superhero-based film. Notably, Richard King's win in the Sound Editing category blocked a complete awards sweep of the evening by the eventual Best Picture winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Although it did not receive a Best Picture nomination, the show's opening song paid homage to The Dark Knight along with the five Best Picture nominees, including host Hugh Jackman riding on a mockup of the Batpod made out of garbage. In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the Best Picture nominee list, prompting controversy and led many to criticize the Academy Awards for [...] "snubbing" [...] the film. There was speculation that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later changed their number of Best Picture nominees to ten, instead of the traditional five, because of the film's omission. In a question-and-answer session that followed the announcement, the Academy's then president Sidney Ganis said; [...] "I would not be telling you the truth <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> the words Dark Knight did not come up." ...|$|E

[...] In 2004, Joe Higgins {{described}} Ahern's response to questions as [...] "like playing handball against a hay stack. You hear a dull thud but the ball never comes back to you". Ahern features as one of the main characters portrayed in spoof radio comic strips Gift Grub and Nob Nation. The fortnightly magazine The Phoenix featured [...] "De Diary of a Nortsoide Taoiseach", a satirical column written from Ahern's point of view in a phonetic transliteration of his broad north Dublin accent. His idiosyncratic delivery made Ahern a doyen of satirists and impersonators, from Dermot Morgan (in the 90's) to Mario Rosenstock (RTÉ 2 TV, 2012). Ahern was satirised in a spoof publication Bertie's little book of ethics.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end".

2500|$|After the September 11 {{attacks in}} 2001, {{performances}} by the Boston Symphony Orchestra of excerpts from Klinghoffer were canceled. BSO Managing Director Mark Volpe remarked of the decision: [...] "We originally programmed the choruses from John Adams’ The Death of Klinghoffer {{because we believe}} in it {{as a work of}} art, and we still hold that conviction. ... explained that it was a purely human reason, and that it wasn’t in the least bit a criticism of the work." [...] Adams and Klinghoffer librettist Alice Goodman criticized the decision, and Adams rejected a request to substitute a performance of Harmonium, saying: [...] "The reason that I asked them not to do 'Harmonium' was that I felt that 'Klinghoffer' is a serious and humane work, and it's also a work about which many people have made prejudicial judgments without even hearing it. I felt that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'OK, [...] "Klinghoffer" [...] is too hot to handle, do [...] "Harmonium,"' that in a sense I would be agreeing with the judgment about 'Klinghoffer.'"
