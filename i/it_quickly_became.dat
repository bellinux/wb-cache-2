The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle {{began as}} a {{vigorous}} tropical wave over Africa. As the wave emerged into the Atlantic, <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> more organized due to favorable conditions, including low wind shear. The circulation consolidated and spawned Tropical Depression Four {{on the morning of}} August13 south-southeast of the Cape Verde islands. The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E
5|$|Late on December 29, {{more than}} four weeks after the {{official}} end to the season, a tropical disturbance developed in the east-central Atlantic. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> more organized and was declared Tropical Depression Thirty on December 30. The next day, Thirty was declared a tropical storm naming it Zeta. Zeta made a turn toward the west but stalled and gradually weakened until dissipating on January 6, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The Palace Pier was {{constructed}} {{as a replacement}} for the Chain Pier, which collapsed in 1896 during construction. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> popular, and had become a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it continued to hold regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various fairground rides and roller coasters.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} and an upper level trough interacted on October 10 {{to the south}} of Bermuda, and formed an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on October 12, {{producing}} hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on October 12 and a tropical cyclone on October 13. Karen strengthened to reach 80mph (130km/h) winds as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> extratropical.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> apparent that the MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the third largest party, Clegg had {{announced}} that the Liberal Democrats would enter talks with whichever party held the greater number of seats. A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a major obstacle to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karen was a {{hurricane}} of non-tropical origin that formed in October of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed {{out of the}} interaction between a cold front and an upper level trough on October 10 located to the south of Bermuda, and quickly strengthened as an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on October 12, producing hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on the 12th and a tropical cyclone on the 13th. Karen strengthened to reach 80mph (130km/h) winds as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> extratropical.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> {{evident that}} the {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Portions of JSOC {{units have}} made up the {{constantly}} changing special operations task force, operating in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as Task Force 121, it was formed {{in the summer of}} 2003, when the military merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The Charing Cross Hotel, {{designed}} by Edward Middleton Barry, opened on 15 May 1865 {{and gave the}} station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street {{as well as the}} front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe {{on the other side of}} Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the two parts of the hotel together.|$|E
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} marketed and {{sold by the}} Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. <b>It</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> popular with professional jazz musicians in organ trios, a small group centered on the Hammond organ. Organ trios were hired by jazz club owners, who found that organ trios were a much cheaper alternative to hiring a big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock, and reggae, {{as well as being}} an important instrument in progressive rock.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and <b>it</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E
