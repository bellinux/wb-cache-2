The uncertainty and unpredictability lead to high interest rates to cover for any eventual loss. High interest rates may lead to high cost of capital, low investment, reduction in aggregate supply {{of goods and services}} and a vicious circle that reduces economic growth. It also reduces credit availability and increase the risk of speculation and adverse selection. These problems result in lower standard of living due to reduced disposable income.

Secondly, to examine how expected return on bonds relative to alternative assets influence pricing of loanable <b>funds</b> <b>by</b> commercial banks in Kenya.
