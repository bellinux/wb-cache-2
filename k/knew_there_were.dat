25|$|In July, {{a warrant}} was issued to the ATF to search NCCF {{headquarters}} for 60 {{machine guns and}} 180 sticks of dynamite. The warrant was based on information provided to agent Thomas Sledge by a 12-year-old girl, Marialice Clark, who was the sister of Linda Clark, a girlfriend of Ed Poindexter. Sledge spelled Clark's name incorrectly in his affidavit as Mary Ellis Clark. Sledge claimed that Clark watched five men make a bomb out of dynamite, including Frank and Will Peak, two cousins of Duane Peak, a 16-year-old {{who would be the}} state's main witness against Rice and Poindexter. The affidavit claimed the men planted the bomb at Components Concepts Corporation, took a photograph of it there, and came back to NCCF headquarters and showed the photograph to Marialice Clark. The Omaha FBI called the Justice Department in Washington because they had an informant in the NCCF chapter and <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no machine guns or dynamite located there. The Justice Department ordered the US Attorney in Omaha, J. William Gallup, to rescind the warrant and cancel the raid. An attorney in the criminal division of the DOJ told him that due to the murders of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in Chicago in December, 1969, the DOJ wanted no more raids on Black Panther houses.|$|E

[...] "I can't understand the population. [...] They're not using them." [...] According to Brooks, most of the over one billion Kennedy half dollars containing silver had been hoarded by the public.

That, too, was dismissed when the California Superior Court ordered the police to provide protection as they would for any other group.
