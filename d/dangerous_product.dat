25|$|In June 2005, the {{retailer}} received fines and costs totalling almost £4,400 after pleading guilty at Barnsley Magistrates Court of supplying dangerous frying pans.

25|$|With eukaryotes, {{attempts}} to clone segments of DNA using recombinant DNA technology from warm-blooded vertebrates genomes {{were to be}} performed only with vector-host systems that had demonstrably restricted growth capabilities outside the laboratory and in a moderate risk containment facility. This was because they potentially contained cryptic viral genomes that were potentially pathogenic to humans. However, unless the organism made a <b>dangerous</b> <b>product,</b> recombinant DNAs from cold-blooded vertebrates and all other lower eukaryotes could be constructed and propagated with the safest vector-host system available in low risk containment facilities. Additionally, purified DNA from any source that performed known functions and was judged to be non-toxic could be cloned with available vectors in low risk containment facilities.|$|E

The most important measures to prevent accidents to be taken by the transport company were also surveyed. It was observed that the majority of accidents with <b>dangerous</b> <b>products</b> may have occurred due to human error caused by lack of appropriate knowledge of the drivers, mechanical failure of equipments or bad conditions of the roads...|$|R

40|$|Despite a law {{requiring}} manufacturers {{to provide the}} Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) with "immediate" notification of <b>dangerous</b> <b>products,</b> the agency typically delays nearly seven months after learning of <b>dangerous,</b> defective <b>products</b> before telling the public.

Perhaps as shocking, the CPSC then took an average of 209 additional days before disclosing {{the information to the}} public [...] even though each case concerned a <b>product</b> defect so <b>dangerous</b> that the item was recalled.

50|$|Poppy Cultivation and the Opium Trade {{have been}} said {{to have had a}} more {{significant}} impact on the civilians in Afghanistan than the impact of wheat farming and livestock trading. As farmers in Afghanistan were once heavily reliant on wheat farming to make sufficient income, the development of poppy cultivation has given many of these farmers a boost in capital, even though the Opium Trade may be a more <b>dangerous</b> <b>product</b> to distribute. In addition, as the demand for Opium has elevated, women have more opportunity to work in the same setting as their male counterpart.|$|E

50|$|While {{there were}} {{organized}} efforts {{to hunt down}} refractory priests and organized protests of religious ceremonies, many revolutionary leaders began to see all this as detrimental to the movement. Some were vehemently ethically opposed, such as Maximilien Robespierre, who argued that atheism was a <b>dangerous</b> <b>product</b> of aristocratic decadence, and believed that a moral society should at least acknowledge the provenance of a Supreme Being. Others had more practical objections, knowing that deep-seated religious beliefs would not be eliminated quickly, and that mobilizing popular support for the Revolution was of top importance. Dividing and alienating the masses over religious issues was unhelpful.|$|E

As she is falling into a pier, she dies but is then revived by Egyptian cats that grant her with superhuman cat-like abilities.
