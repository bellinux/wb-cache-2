5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for {{no longer than}} three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with the}} development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. <b>Dapsone</b> is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical <b>dapsone</b> is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and <b>dapsone</b> (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of <b>dapsone.</b> If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dapsone</b> (also called diphenylsulfone, DDS, or avlosulfon) is an {{anti-infective}} sulfone drug. <b>Dapsone</b> {{may also}} be helpful in treating lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and as a second-line treatment for ITP. The mechanism by which <b>dapsone</b> assists in ITP is unclear but an increased platelet count is seen in 4060 percent of recipients.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} leprostatic agents are {{available}} for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, treatment with daily <b>dapsone</b> and monthly rifampicin for six months is recommended. While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases, treatment with daily <b>dapsone</b> and clofazimine along with monthly rifampicin for 12 months is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide {{has also}} been used due to its immune-modifying effect. <b>Dapsone</b> and {{rebamipide}} have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for mucocutaneous lesions.|$|E
25|$|The causative {{agent of}} leprosy, M. leprae, was {{discovered}} by G. H. Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it the first bacterium {{to be identified as}} causing disease in humans. The first effective treatment (promin) became available in the 1940s. In the 1950s, <b>dapsone</b> was introduced. The search for further effective antileprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and <b>dapsone,</b> intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. MDT combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three antileprosy drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dapsone,</b> an antibiotic, is {{commonly}} used in the United States and Brazil {{for the treatment of}} necrosis. There have been conflicting reports with some supporting its efficacy and others have suggested it should no longer be used routinely, if at all.|$|E
25|$|Leprosy is curable with a {{treatment}} known as multidrug therapy. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy {{is with the}} medications <b>dapsone</b> and rifampicin for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, <b>dapsone,</b> and clofazimine for 12 months. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization. Globally in 2012, the number of chronic cases of leprosy was 189,000, down from some 5.2 million in the 1980s. The number of new cases was 230,000. Most new cases occur in 16 countries, with India accounting for more than half. In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy. About 200 cases are reported {{per year in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|In South America, <b>dapsone</b> {{has been}} tried at 100mg/day for one week, unless there is active {{hemolysis}} or G6PD deficiency. No controlled trials have been reported; the practice is controversial, but clinical experience in Per√∫ and several limited studies support this practice. Systemic corticosteroids are often considered, but without clinical trials to support the practice.|$|E
25|$|Identified by {{methenamine}} silver stain of lung tissue, type I pneumocytes, {{and type}} II pneumocytes over-replicate and damage alveolar epithelium, causing death by asphyxiation. Fluid leaks into alveoli, producing an exudate seen as honeycomb/cotton candy appearance on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Drug {{of choice is}} Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, pentamidine, or <b>dapsone.</b> In HIV patients, most cases occur when the CD4 count is below 200 cells per microliter.|$|E
25|$|In {{otherwise}} healthy individuals, the protective enzyme systems normally present in {{red blood cells}} rapidly reduce the methemoglobin back to hemoglobin and hence maintain methemoglobin levels at {{less than one percent}} of the total hemoglobin concentration. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, <b>dapsone,</b> and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{treatment}} {{should include}} immobilization {{of the affected}} limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used {{with varying degrees of}} success, including hyperbaric oxygen, <b>dapsone,</b> antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Antipneumocystic {{medication}} is used with concomitant steroids {{in order to}} avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used {{medication is}} trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include pentamidine, trimetrexate, <b>dapsone,</b> atovaquone, primaquine, pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} cases, recluse bites are self-limited and {{typically}} heal without any medical intervention. Recommendations {{to limit the}} extent of damage include elevation and immobilization of the affected limb, application of ice. Both local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis are simple standards. There is no established treatment for more extensive necrosis. Many therapies have been used including hyperbaric oxygen, <b>dapsone,</b> antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments conclusively show benefit. Studies have shown surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcome. Excision may delay wound healing, cause abscesses, and lead to objectionable scarring.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, <b>dapsone,</b> fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, <b>dapsone,</b> and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
25|$|From 1936 to 1958, Browne {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed {{a wide range of}} roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients {{with a wide variety of}} ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and Onchocerciasis. Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use <b>Dapsone</b> in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, when he discovered it was caused by a black fly that bred on crabs. After having the crabs caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the black fly population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, travelling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot. The doctors of Yakusu were often called to surrounding areas to provide medical care to acutely ill or injured patients.|$|E
2500|$|In presumed {{cases of}} recluse bites, <b>dapsone</b> {{is often used}} for the {{treatment}} of necrosis, but controlled clinical trials have yet to demonstrate efficacy. However, <b>dapsone</b> may be effective in treating many [...] "spider bites" [...] because many such cases are actually misdiagnosed microbial infections. There have been conflicting reports about its efficacy in treating brown recluse bites, and some have suggested it should no longer be used routinely, if at all.|$|E
2500|$|Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. [...] Classical drug {{causes of}} methemoglobinaemia include {{antibiotics}} (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and <b>dapsone),</b> local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine), and aniline dyes, metoclopramide, rasburicase, [...] chlorates, and bromates. Ingestion of compounds containing nitrates (such as the patina chemical bismuth nitrate) {{can also cause}} methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley George Browne [...] (8 December 1907 ‚Äì 20 January 1986), {{also called}} [...] "Bonganga" [...] by the {{community}} members with whom he worked, was a British medical missionary and leprologist known for his work and his many research achievements throughout the 20th century in the Belgian Congo, Nigeria, and India including his early use of <b>Dapsone.</b> He received numerous awards throughout his academic and professional career. He {{is also known as}} an academic for his early publications surrounding his findings of leprosy of which he published about 150 articles and five books.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapsone</b> is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} and prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS patients who are allergic to or intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Acedapsone is a derivative of <b>dapsone</b> that has little activity against M. leprae but is converted to an active <b>dapsone</b> metabolite. It is a long-acting intramuscular repository form of <b>dapsone</b> with a half-life of 46 days. It may prove useful in leprosy patients who cannot tolerate long-term oral <b>dapsone</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|Toxic {{hepatitis}} and cholestatic jaundice {{have been}} reported by the manufacturer. Jaundice may also occur {{as part of the}} <b>dapsone</b> reaction or <b>dapsone</b> syndrome (see below). <b>Dapsone</b> is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system, specifically isozymes CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. <b>Dapsone</b> metabolites produced by the cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapsone</b> is an {{effective}} treatment for most patients. DH responds to <b>dapsone</b> so quickly (itching is significantly reduced within 2-3 days) that this response may almost be considered diagnostic. However, <b>dapsone</b> treatment {{has no effect on}} any intestinal damage (see coeliac disease) that might be present.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dapsone</b> {{had been}} {{reported}} {{in a few cases}} to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. For many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of <b>dapsone</b> that would be as effective against acne as oral <b>dapsone,</b> but without the hemolysis side effect. This was difficult to accomplish because <b>dapsone</b> is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. In the early 2000s QLT USA developed Aczone, a 5% <b>dapsone</b> gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with G6PD deficiency. [...] In February 2016, the FDA approved a 7.5% <b>dapsone</b> gel. This higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dapsone</b> is {{the drug}} of choice. For {{individuals}} with DH unable to tolerate <b>dapsone</b> for any reason, alternative treatment options may include the following: ...|$|E
50|$|Beyond its solubility, however, promin {{was later}} {{found to have}} no real {{advantages}} over the simpler compound <b>dapsone</b> (which is administered in tablet form). Promin and other sulfones can also {{not be used as}} substitutes for <b>dapsone</b> when intolerance develops, as this is a general reaction to sulfones, and not specific to <b>dapsone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapsone</b> (also called diphenylsulfone, DDS, or avlosulfon) is an {{anti-infective}} sulfone drug. <b>Dapsone</b> {{may also}} be helpful in treating lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and as a second-line treatment for ITP. The mechanism by which <b>dapsone</b> assists in ITP is unclear but an increased platelet count is seen in 40 - 60 percent of recipients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapsone</b> is the {{recommended}} treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral <b>dapsone</b> alone {{was effective in}} 80% of early cases of the disease. However, <b>dapsone</b> can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective.|$|E
5000|$|A {{single case}} report {{suggested}} that oral <b>dapsone</b> {{may be useful}} for prevention. However, the efficacy of oral <b>dapsone</b> as prevention has not been demonstrated very clearly until now.|$|E
50|$|Other {{options for}} {{refractory}} symptoms of chronic urticaria include anti-inflammatory medications, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants. Potential anti-inflammatory agents include <b>dapsone,</b> sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine. <b>Dapsone</b> is a sulfone antimicrobial agent and {{is thought to}} suppress prostaglandin and leukotriene activity. It is helpful in therapy-refractory cases and is contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency. Sulfasalazine, a 5-ASA derivative, is thought to alter adenosine release and inhibit IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, Sulfasalazine is a good option for people with anemia who cannot take <b>dapsone.</b> Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent that suppresses T lymphocytes. It has a low cost however it takes longer than <b>dapsone</b> or sulfasalazine to work.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} side-effects of this drug are dose-related hemolysis (which {{may lead to}} hemolytic anemia) and methemoglobinemia. About 20% of patients treated with <b>dapsone</b> suffer hemolysis and the side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination Lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. A case of hemolysis in a neonate from <b>dapsone</b> in breast milk has been reported. Agranulocytosis occurs rarely when <b>dapsone</b> is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. Abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are {{the cause of the}} majority of deaths attributable to <b>dapsone</b> therapy.|$|E
50|$|As an antibacterial, <b>dapsone</b> {{inhibits}} bacterial {{synthesis of}} dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate {{for the active site}} of dihydropteroate synthase. Though structurally distinct from <b>dapsone,</b> the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also {{work in this}} way.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dapsone</b> by {{mouth was}} one of the first {{medications}} used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. A topical form of <b>dapsone</b> is also effective with potentially less side effects.|$|E
50|$|Acedapsone is {{conveniently}} {{prepared by}} acetylation of <b>dapsone.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} leprostatic agents are {{available}} for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases, treatment with daily <b>dapsone</b> and monthly rifampicin for six months is recommended. While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases, treatment with daily <b>dapsone</b> and clofazimine along with monthly rifampicin for 12 months is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Mycobacterium leprae was {{sensitive}} to <b>dapsone</b> (diaminodiphenylsulfone, the first effective treatment which was discovered for leprosy in the 1940s), but resistance against this antibiotic has developed over time. Therapy with <b>dapsone</b> alone is now strongly contraindicated. Currently, a multidrug treatment (MDT) is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization, including <b>dapsone,</b> rifampicin and clofazimine. In patients receiving the MDT, {{a high proportion of}} the bacilli die within {{a short amount of time}} without immediate relief of symptoms. This suggests many symptoms of leprosy must be due in part to the presence of dead cells.|$|E
