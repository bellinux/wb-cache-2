40|$|The enterolignans {{enterolactone}} and <b>enterodiol</b> are phytoestrogens {{that are}} formed from plant lignans by microorganisms {{in the human}} colon. Enterolignans circulate in plasma as conjugates. We hypothesized that conjugation of enterolignans takes place in colon epithelial cells, and studied {{the time course of}} uptake and metabolism of enterolactone and <b>enterodiol</b> in three human colon epithelial cell lines. In addition, the conjugates were identified by mass spectrometry with accurate mass measurement (LC/QTOFMS/MS). Intracellular levels of conjugated enterolactone and <b>enterodiol</b> in HT 29 cells rose immediately after starting the exposure. This was accompanied by a rapid decrease in free enterolactone and <b>enterodiol</b> in the exposure medium of HT 29 and (un) differentiated CaCo- 2 but not of CCD 841 CoTr cells. Conjugation and excretion of enterolactone and <b>enterodiol</b> was complete within 8 h, except for <b>enterodiol</b> in CaCo- 2 cells (48 h). Enterolactone appears to be more rapidly metabolized and/or excreted than <b>enterodiol,</b> and also the appearance of conjugated enterolactone in medium is less affected by the presence of <b>enterodiol</b> than vice versa. Total (free plus conjugated) enterolignan concentrations remained constant throughout the experiments.

Twelve healthy volunteers ingested a single dose of purified SDG (1. 31 ¿mol/kg body wt). Enterolignans appeared in plasma 8 - 10 h after ingestion of the purified SDG. <b>Enterodiol</b> reached its maximum plasma concentration 14. 8 ± 5. 1 h (mean ± SD) after ingestion of SDG, whereas enterolactone reached its maximum 19. 7 ± 6. 2 h after ingestion. The mean elimination half-life of <b>enterodiol</b> (4. 4 ± 1. 3 h) was shorter than that of enterolactone (12. 6 ± 5. 6 h). The mean area under the curve of enterolactone (1762 ± 1117 nmol/L·h) was twice as large as that of <b>enterodiol</b> (966 ± 639 nmol/L·h). The mean residence time for <b>enterodiol</b> was 20. 6 ± 5. 9 h and that for enterolactone was 35. 8 ± 10. 6 h.

In conclusion, a substantial part of enterolignans becomes available in the blood circulation and is subsequently excreted. The measured mean residence times and elimination half-lives indicate that enterolignans accumulate in plasma when consumed 2 - 3 times a day and reach steady state.

This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7 -week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52 – 82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (<b>enterodiol,</b> enterolactone, and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0 -gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of <b>enterodiol</b> by 1, 009 and 2, 867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21, 242 and 52, 826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (<b>enterodiol</b> 1 enterolactone 1 matairesinol) by 24, 333 and 60, 640 nmol/day, respectively.

40|$|Aims: Oestrogens {{are known}} to act {{on a number of}} tissues {{throughout}} the body via classical oestrogen receptors, alpha (ER-a) and beta (ER-beta). Previous research has shown that oestrogens can regulate skeletal muscle glucose uptake cellular proliferation. Thus, oestrogens and related molecules provide an interesting focus for research into possible therapies for the treatment of metabolic disorders and sarcopenia. <b>Enterodiol</b> and enterolactone are plant derived mammalian enterolignans which share a struc- tural similarity to the human oestrogen oestradiol. Methods: In the present study we incubated the differentiated rat skeletal muscle cell line L 6 concentration ranges of both com- pounds in the presence/absence of oestrogen receptor antagonists and measured glucose uptake using the non-metabolised glucose analogue 2 -NBDG. Cellular proliferation was also measured using a modified MTS assay. Results: Enterolactone was seen to cause a significant increase in cellular proliferation after 48 h (a maximal 25 % at 0. 1 nmol/l), in an ER-a dependent mechanism. Incubation with 10 nmol/l and 100 nmol/l <b>enterodiol</b> caused significant increases in 2 -NBDG (5000 % compared with control, p < 0. 001) and 2 h glucose depletion from media (15 % increase compared with control, p < 0. 05), also in an ER-a dependent way. These results suggest these dietary derived oestrogen-like molecules might be of potential use in targeting metabolic disorders or sarcopenia.

In the present study, we examined the associations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count with lignans, which are more frequent in the Western diet than isoflavones. METHODS: Our analysis included 2, 028 participants of NHANES 2005 - 2008 and 2, 628 participants of NHANES 1999 - 2004 aged 18 years and older.

30|$|Enterolactone is a biphenol, {{which can}} {{function}} as anti-oxidant. A {{study shows that}} high serum enterolactone level is associated with reduced CVD mortality (Vanharanta et al., 2003). Furthermore, low serum enterolactone is associated with increased in vivo lipid peroxidation, assessed by plasma F 2 -isoprostane concentrations (Vanharanta et al., 2002). In addition, urinary total and individual phytoestrogens were significantly inversely associated with serum C-reactive protein (CRP; an inflammation biomarker) (Reger et al., 2017). Phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen receptors (Morito et al., 2001), which either mimics estrogen or works as antagonist (Fitzpatrick, 1999). Thus, the effects of phytoestrogens can be biphasic: for example, phytoestrogens both increases vasodilation and nitric oxide metabolism that may have a favorable impact on vascular health; on the other hand, phytoestrogen may also have some prothrombotic or proinflammatory effects that may offset other benefits (Herrington, 2000). Both enterolactone and <b>enterodiol</b> can alleviate the effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes activated by lipopolysaccharide (Corsini et al., 2010). Such lymphocytes activation leads to inhibitory-κB (I-κB) degradation and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation thereby resulting in TNF-α production (Corsini et al., 2010).

We investigated the association between in utero exposure to phytoestrogens and early menarche (defined as < 11. 5 years of age at onset) using data from a nested case-control study within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a longitudinal study involving families living in the South West of England. Concentrations of six phytoestrogens were measured in maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between tertiles of phytoestrogen concentrations and menarche status, with adjustment for maternal age at menarche, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), child birth order, duration of breastfeeding, and gestational age at sample collection. Among 367 mother-daughter dyads, maternal median (interquartile range) creatinine-corrected concentrations (in 25 g/g creatinine) were: genistein 62. 1 (27. 1 - 160. 9), daidzein 184. 8 (88. 8 - 383. 7), equol 4. 3 (2. 8 - 9. 0), O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) 13. 0 (4. 4 - 34. 5), <b>enterodiol</b> 76. 1 (39. 1 - 135. 8), and enterolactone 911. 7 (448. 1 - 1558. 0). In analyses comparing those in the highest tertile relative {{to those in the}} lowest tertile of in utero phytoestrogen exposure, higher <b>enterodiol</b> levels were inversely associated with early menarche (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 47; 95...|$|E

Results were compared with those from 178 healthy men matched by age and date of recruitment. Levels of seven phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, <b>enterodiol,</b> and enterolactone) were measured in spot urine and serum samples. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COMT, CYP 19, ESR 1, and SHBG genes were genotyped. Urinary levels of all phytoestrogens correlated strongly with serum levels. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 63 (glycitein) to 0. 88 (daidzein) (...|$|E

Four Norwegian Red Cows where allocated in a 4 x 4 latin square with four different silages. Silages had different botanical composition; red clover, botanical diverse, perennial ryegrass and timothy. The concentration of phytoestrogens was measured in feeds, omasum phases, feces, urine and milk by using the liquid chromatography (LC) -mass spectrometry (MS) /MS technique. Metabolism in reticulorumen and in digestive tract as well as apparent recovery in milk was calculated. Concentration of isoflavones was highest in red clover silage and lowest in timothy silage. For lignans it was the opposite. Phytoestrogens was extensively metabolized in reticulo-rumen. Biochanin A and genistein had the highest metabolism on the red clover diet and lowest on timothy. A number of unknown lignans was metabolized to the mammalian lignans <b>enterodiol</b> and enterolactone in the reticulo-rumen. When passing to omasum, isoflavones and coumestrol mainly followed large particles, while lignans was in greater extent evenly distributed between phases. Through the digestive system, differences in content of phytoestrogens between diets became smaller or disappeared. The concentration of isoflavones in milk was increasing with increasing intake. Red clover diet had the highest concentration of isoflavones in milk, with a dominance of equol. It appears that concentration of phytoestrogens in milk can be manipulated trough intake, but the effect is diminishing with increasing concentration in feeds...|$|E
40|$|Phytoestrogens (isoflavones, ellagitannins, and lignans) are {{polyphenols}} with an estrogenic/antiestrogenic function {{present in}} fruits, vegetables, and foods derived from them. Some microorganisms {{are capable of}} transforming isoflavones, ellagitannins, and lignans into equol, urolithins, and enterolignans, respectively. These compounds are more bioavailable, they have more estrogenic/antiestrogenic and antioxidant activity than their precursors, and they are associated with beneficial effects for human health. Extracts of soy- bean and lignans and ellagic acid were incubated with feces, or bacteria isolated from feces, and later the phytoestrogens were extracted twice with diethyl ether and twice with ethyl acetate, and the solvents were evaporated at room temperature under a N 2. Subsequently, phytoestrogens were detected by HPLC-PAD and chromatographic peaks were identified by HPLC-ESI/M, and they were confirmed by comparison of retention times and characteristics of UV spectra with those of standards. Analysis of phytoestrogens by means of HPLC- PAD allowed the simultaneous detection of isoflavones, ellagitannins, and lignans metabolized, or not, by intestinal microbiota with high sensitivity (LOD: equol 0. 11 mg/L; urolithin A 0. 17 mg/L, <b>enterodiol</b> 0. 15 mg/L). Assays were linear up to at least 20 mg/L in all standards with a high correlation (equol > 0. 999; urolithin A > 0. 998, <b>enterodiol</b> > 0. 999). Therefore, the described method constitutes an affordable and easy alternative method {{for the detection of}} phytoestrogen metabolism. Moreover, this method could be applied to the detection of isoflavones, lignans, and ellagitannins in food. This work was supported by RM 2012 - 00004 - 00 - 00 Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Lignans; enterodiol; enterolactone; plasma; flaxseed; bioavailability; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; case-control studies; {{prospective}} studies; colorectal adenomas; colorectal carcinomas; {{coronary heart}} diseases Lignans are biphenolic compounds {{that occur in}} foods of plant origin. Some of the plant lignans can be converted into the enterolignans, <b>enterodiol</b> and enterolactone, by the microorganisms in the colon. Because of their biological activities, enterolignans may affect the development of chronic diseases. It is not sufficiently known to what extent enterolignans become bioavailable, i. e., are absorbed and used for metabolic processes in the body. The aim of the present research was to gain further insight in the bioavailability of enterolignans and in their relation with several chronic diseases. To {{be able to do}} this, we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method using triply 13 C-labeled isotopes for the simultaneous quantification of <b>enterodiol</b> and enterolactone in plasma. <b>Enterodiol</b> and enterolactone absorption started 8 to 10 hours after consumption of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, an isolated plant lignan, and they were eliminated slowly. A substantial part (~ 40 %) of the enterolignans was excreted in urine, and thus had been available in the blood circulation. Because of the slow elimination, enterolignans will accumulate and reach steady state concentrations in plasma when consumed 2 to 3 times a day. As lignans are present in many foods this is very likely to happen. The bioavailability of lignans from flaxseeds, a high lignan source, improved substantially when whole seeds were replaced by crushed or ground seeds. Independent determinants of plasma concentrations of enterolignans were, besides the intake of plant lignans, use of antibiotic therapy, defecation frequency, and body mass index. Our data suggest a protective role of enterolignans against colorectal adenomas; the risk reduction was ~ 2 -fold in highest versus lowest quartile of enterolignan plasma concentrations. However, a protective effect could not be confirmed for colorectal carcinomas. Moreover, we observed increased risks (~ 2. 5 -fold) in women, especially in postmenopausal women, and in subjects with a high body mass index. This suggests that an estrogen-related hormonal mechanism might be involved. In addition, our data do not support a protective role of enterolignans against the development of nonfatal myocardial infarction. In conclusion, a substantial part of the enterolignans enters the blood circulation and is subsequently excreted in urine. Enterolignans might protect against colorectal adenomas. We did not find protective associations for colorectal carcinomas and myocardial infarction. At this point, there is not enough evidence to give recommendations regarding the consumption of foods rich in lignans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mother's diet during {{pregnancy}} is important, since plant lignans and their metabolites, converted by the intestinal microflora to enterolignans, are proposed to possess multiple health benefits. Aim {{of our study}} was to investigate whether a dietary intervention affects lignan concentrations in the serum of pregnant women. Methods A controlled dietary intervention trial including 105 first-time pregnant women was conducted in three intervention and three control maternity health clinics. The intervention included individual counseling on diet and on physical activity, while the controls received conventional care. Blood samples were collected on gestation weeks 8 - 9 (baseline) and 36 - 37 (end of intervention). The serum levels of the plant lignans 7 -hydroxymatairesinol, secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, cyclolariciresinol, and pinoresinol, and of the enterolignans 7 -hydroxyenterolactone, <b>enterodiol,</b> and enterolactone, were measured using a validated method. Results The baseline levels of enterolactone, <b>enterodiol</b> and the sum of lignans were higher in the control group, whereas {{at the end of the}} trial their levels were higher in the intervention group. The adjusted mean differences between the baseline and end of the intervention for enterolactone and the total lignan intake were 1. 6 ng/ml (p = 0. 018, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 3) and 1. 4 ng/mg (p = 0. 08, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 9) higher in the intervention group than in the controls. Further adjustment for dietary components did not change these associations. Conclusion The dietary intervention was successful in increasing the intake of lignan-rich food products, the fiber consumption and consequently the plasma levels of lignans in pregnant women.

In addition, the use of mixtures of -glucuroni-dase and sulfatase enzymes from diVerent sources was investigated to Wnd enzyme preparations that contained lower amounts of nat-urally present phytoestrogens. QuantiWcation of aglycones spiked with 13 C 3 -labeled internal standards {{was carried out by}} LC–MS/ MS. In urine, all of the phytoestrogen conjugates hydrolyzed within 2 h under standard hydrolysis conditions (24 l H. pomatia, pH 5, 37 °C). Hydrolysis rates were improved at 45 °C and by doubling the enzyme concentration and may be used to further reduce hydrolysis times down to 100 min. In plasma, a 16 -h hydrolysis was required to ensure complete hydrolysis of all conjugates. As with urine, the use of increased temperature or increased enzyme concentration reduced hydrolysis times for most analytes. However, the rate of hydrolysis in plasma was signiWcantly slower than that in urine for all analytes except <b>enterodiol,</b> for which the reverse was true. Neither increased temperature nor increased enzyme concentration increased the rate of hydrolysis of enterolactone. Hydrolysis at pH 6 proved to be detrimental to hydrolysis of phytoestrogen conjugates, especially those in plasma. Other enzyme preparations from diVerent sources, such as -glucuronidase from Escherichia coli, were found to contain lower amounts of contaminating phy-toestrogens and showed increased enzyme activity for isoXavones, but lower activity for lignans, when used with other sulfatas...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between dietary contribution of ultra-processed foods and urinary phytoestrogen concentrations in the US. Participants from cross-sectional 2009 – 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged 6 + years, selected to measure urinary phytoestrogens and with one 24 -h dietary recall were evaluated (2692 participants). Food items were classified according to NOVA (a name, not an acronym), a four-group food classification based on the extent and purpose of industrial food processing. Ultra-processed foods are formulations manufactured using several ingredients and a series of processes (hence “ultra-processed”). Most of their ingredients are lower-cost industrial sources of dietary energy and nutrients, with additives used for the purpose of imitating sensorial qualities of minimally processed foods or of culinary preparations of these foods. Studied phytoestrogens included lignans (enterolactone and <b>enterodiol)</b> and isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin and equol). Gaussian regression was used to compare average urinary phytoestrogen concentrations (normalized by creatinine) across quintiles of energy share of ultra-processed foods. Models incorporated survey sample weights and were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and education, among other factors. Adjusted <b>enterodiol</b> geometric means decreased monotonically from 60. 6 in the lowest quintile to 35. 1 µg/g creatinine in the highest, while adjusted enterolactone geometric means dropped from 281. 1 to 200. 1 across the same quintiles, respectively. No significant linear trend was observed in the association between these quintiles and isoflavone concentrations. This finding reinforces the existing evidence regarding the negative impact of ultra-processed food consumption on the overall quality of the diet and expands it to include non-nutrients such as lignans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} enterolignans, e. g., <b>enterodiol</b> (END) and {{particularly}} its oxidation product, enterolactone (ENL), on prevention of hormone-dependent diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and menopausal syndrome, have attracted much attention. To date, the main way to obtain END and ENL is chemical synthesis, which is expensive and inevitably leads to environmental pollution. To explore a more economic and eco-friendly production method, we explored biotransformation of enterolignans from precursors contained in defatted flaxseeds by human intestinal bacteria. Results We cultured fecal specimens from healthy young adults in media containing defatted flaxseeds and detected END from the culture supernatant. Following selection through successive subcultures of the fecal microbiota with defatted flaxseeds {{as the only}} carbon source, we obtained a bacterial consortium, designated as END- 49, which contained the smallest number of bacterial types still capable of metabolizing defatted flaxseeds to produce END. Based on analysis with pulsed field gel electrophoresis, END- 49 was found to consist of five genomically distinct bacterial lineages, designated Group I-V, with Group I strains dominating the culture. None of the individual Group I-V strains produced END, demonstrating that the biotransformation of substrates in defatted flaxseeds into END is a joint work by different members of the END- 49 bacterial consortium. Interestingly, Group I strains produced secoisolariciresinol, an important intermediate of END production; 16 S rRNA analysis of one Group I strain established its close relatedness with Klebsiella. Genomic analysis is under way to identify all members in END- 49 involved in the biotransformation and the actual pathway leading to END-production. Conclusion Biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and environmentally friendly way of mass-producing <b>enterodiol</b> from defatted flaxseeds. </p...|$|E
