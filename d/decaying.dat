5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found growing on the <b>decaying</b> or blackened remains of other mushrooms; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to <b>decaying</b> mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate.

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena purpureofusca grow singly or in {{clusters}} on the <b>decaying</b> wood of conifers, particularly spruce, pine, and Douglas-fir.

5000|$|Some nuclei can undergo double beta <b>decay</b> (ββ <b>decay)</b> {{where the}} charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta <b>decay</b> is {{difficult}} to study, as the process has an extremely long half-life. In nuclei for which both β <b>decay</b> and ββ <b>decay</b> are possible, the rarer ββ <b>decay</b> process is effectively impossible to observe. However, in nuclei where β <b>decay</b> is forbidden but ββ <b>decay</b> is allowed, the process can be seen and a half-life measured. Thus, ββ <b>decay</b> is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta <b>decay,</b> double beta <b>decay</b> does not change thus, {{at least one of}} the nuclides with some given [...] has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta <b>decay.</b>|$|R

However, 7Be <b>decays</b> only via electron capture, a phenomenon to which its unusually long half-life may be attributed. Also anomalous is 8Be, which <b>decays</b> via alpha <b>decay</b> to 4He. This alpha <b>decay</b> is often considered fission, which {{would be able to}} account for its extremely short half-life.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the HyperCP {{experiment}} at Fermilab is to test CP in hyperon <b>decays</b> by comparing the <b>decay</b> distributions for Ξ− (“cascade”) <b>decays</b> in the <b>decay</b> sequence: Ξ− → π− + Λ 0, Λ 0 → π− + p, with those for the antiparticle Ξ̄+. In addition, we can test CP in charged kaon <b>decays</b> by comparing the slopes of the Dalitz plot for Κ+ and Κ− <b>decays.</b> We are also looking at rare <b>decay</b> modes of charged kaons and hyperons, particularly those involving muons.

5000|$|In {{particle}} physics and nuclear physics, the branching fraction (or branching ratio) for a <b>decay</b> is {{the fraction of}} particles which <b>decay</b> by an individual <b>decay</b> mode {{with respect to the}} total number of particles which <b>decay.</b> It is equal to the ratio of the partial <b>decay</b> constant to the overall <b>decay</b> constant. Sometimes a partial half-life is given, but this term is misleading; due to competing modes it is not true that half of the particles will <b>decay</b> through a particular <b>decay</b> mode after its partial half-life.
