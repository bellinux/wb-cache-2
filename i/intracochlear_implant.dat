40|$|In congenitally deaf cats, {{the central}} {{auditory}} system is deprived of acoustic input because of degeneration of the organ of Corti before {{the onset of}} hearing.

40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in American Journal of Otology 1988. This version is reproduced with permission of Lippincott Wilkins & Williams. Studies have been undertaken to confirm the biologic safety of the Cochlear Corporation multi-electrode <b>intracochlear</b> <b>implant.</b> The materials used are biocompatible. The electrode array is flexible: it can be inserted with minimal or no trauma, providing the insertion is stopped when resistance is first felt. An atraumatic insertion is facilitated if a good view is obtained along the scala tympani of the basal turn of the cochlea by drilling through the crista fenestrae. The passage of the electrode around the cochlea can be facilitated if the electrode is rotated during insertion (clockwise for the left and anticlockwise for the right cochlea). The electrode can be explanted and another one reinserted with minimal or no trauma. A seal established around the electrode after an implantation period of 2 weeks can prevent infection extending from the middle to the inner ear. The electrical stimulus parameters produced by the Nucleus receiver-stimulator cause no loss of spiral ganglion cells or corrosion of the platinum band electrodes. Long-term stimulation has been carried out for up to 8 years in patients without affecting their clinical performance. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Advances in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology 1997. This version is reproduced with permission from Karger. [URL] has been established that use of multiple-channel <b>intracochlear</b> <b>implants</b> can significantly improve speech perception for postlinguistically deafened adults. In the development of the Nucleus 22 -channel cochlear implant, there have been significant developments in speech processing strategies, providing additional benefits to speech perception for users. This has recently culminated in the release of the Speak speech processing strategy, developed from research at the University of Melbourne. The Speak strategy employs 20 programmable bandpass filters which are scanned at an adaptive rate, with the largest outputs of these filters presented to up to ten stimulation channels along the electrode array. Comparative studies of the Speak processing strategy (in the Nucleus Spectra- 22 speech processor), with the previously-used Multipeak (Multipeak) speech processing strategy (in the Minisystem- 22 speech processor), with profoundly deaf adult cochlear implant users have shown that the Speak processing strategy provides a significant benefit to adult users both in quiet situations and particularly in the presence of background noise. Since the first implantation of the Nucleus device in a profoundly hearing-impaired child in Melbourne in 1985, there has been a rapid {{growth in the number of}} children using this device. Studies of cochlear implant benefits for children using the Nucleus 22 -channel cochlear implant have also shown that children can obtain significant benefits to speech perception, speech production and language, including open-set understanding of words and sentences using the cochlear implant alone. In evaluating contributing factors to speech perception benefits available for children, four specific factors are important to investigate: (1) earlier implantation -resulting from earlier detection of deafness; (2) improved hardware and surgical techniques -allowing implantation in infants; (3) improved speech processing, and (4) improved habilitation techniques. Results reported previously have been recorded primarily for children using the Multipeak strategy implemented in the MSP speech processor. While it is important to evaluate the factors which might contribute to improvements in speech perception benefits, an important question is the effect of improved speech processing strategy, since this will determine what is perceived through the device. Given that adult patients changing to the Spectra speech processor had also shown improved perception in noisy situations, and the fact that children are in general in noisy environments in the classroom setting for a large proportion of their day, it was of obvious interest to evaluate the potential for benefit in poor signal-to-noise ratios from use of the Speak processing strategy and from specific training in the ability to perceive in background noise. The study was aimed at evaluating whether children who were experienced in use of the Multipeak speech processing strategy would be able to changeover to the new Speak processing strategy, which provides a subjectively different output. Secondly, the study aimed to evaluate the benefits which might accrue to children from use of controlled habilitation in background noise. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a rare {{complication of}} an intracochlear misdirection of the electrode of a cochlear implant in a 55 -year-old male. The patient received a cochlear implant using the mastoid-saving surgical approach. Intraoperative measurements showed impedance and NRT reactions suggesting a reasonable {{function of the}} inner ear and the implant. Postoperatively our patient suffered from passing vertigo. Postoperative CT scans revealed a misdirection implantation of the cochlear implant into the vestibular part of the inner ear. A deformed implant was removed and a reimplantation was successfully performed after enlarging and reshaping the cochleostomy. Our patient now enjoys all the benefits of an optimal functioning cochlear <b>implant.</b> <b>Intracochlear</b> misdirection of the electrode can occur even when intraoperative measurements seem to be normal. When a patient suffers from unexplained vertigo after cochlear implantation with a poor function of the implant a misdirection of the active electrode must be considered.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in multichannel intracochlear implantation have generated interests in correlating individual stimulating electrodes to pitch perception. An appropriate radiographic technique {{is required to}} precisely document {{the location of the}} <b>implanted</b> <b>intracochlear</b> electrode array. Anatomical studies, including the measurements of the temporal bone using high-resolution CT films and 3 D reconstruction from the petrous bone sections, were conducted to define the spatial position of cochlea in the skull. Thus, a "Cochlear View" was designed and introduced for postoperative radiological evaluation of multichannel intracochlear implantation. In this paper, a detailed radiographic method and radiological interpretation of the "Cochlear View" are described. A plain radiograph of the "Cochlear View" was taken of 120 patients who had received the Nucleus multichannel implant. Studies have shown that a plain radiograph of the "Cochlear View" provides sufficient information to correctly evaluate the results of implantation, including the insertion depth and position of individual electrodes. It {{plays an important role in}} guiding the management of frequency mapping and acts as a useful reference for further research purposes. OctoberOpen Acces...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the VIIIth nerve within the cochlea or of the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem can provide hearing sensations in profoundly deaf. The aim of the present project was to quantify the spatial resolution of electrical multipolar <b>intracochlear</b> (cochlear <b>implant)</b> or intracranial (brainstem implant) stimulations. To optimize performance different types of cochlear and brainstem electrodes were first investigated in a saline tank. Potential fields were measured around stimulation electrodes to determine current spread. In addition neuronal responses evoked by different stimulus configurations (bi, -tri and multipolar) were recorded in cortical brain slices and from the eighth nerve {{as well as from}} the auditory cortex of the cat. 3 D models were developed to calculate electrical fields and current density distributions in different stimulus configurations. The configurations were evaluated in respect to their spatial separation (stimulus focusing) by a number of quality factors like channel interaction, cross talk, efficacy, homogeneity and shape. It is concluded, that stimulation electrodes should fill the tympanic space as much as possible and that tripolar stimulus configurations are favorable. Orientation of electrode contacts directed to the inner cochlear wall improves the orientation of electrical field vector in respect to the auditory nerve. Brainstem electrodes are small. This limits the current density possible with save stimulation and requires a direct contact with the target tissue. It was shown that multipolar electrode configurations can evoke direction selective neuronal activity near the stimulation electrodes. The stimulation depth is chiefly determined by the distance between electrodes. Focusing can be achieved by small electrode distances or tripolar stimulus configurations. The results can be generally transferred to the development of other neuroprotheses. (orig.)

There is a choice of two alternative surgical procedures, both of which are via a combined middle ear approach using anterior and posterior tympanotomies. Four active electrodes shaped into compressible platinum-iridium soft-balls are fed through the mastoid cavity and across the facial recess, and placed into cavities that are made over the cochlear turns that project to the medial wall of the middle ear. One hard-ball active electrode is placed into the round window niche. One hard-ball reference electrode is placed into the hypotympanum. An additional electrode wrapped around the lead wire assembly can be used as an alternative reference electrode. A specially designed insertion needle facilitates the placement and the fixation of the soft-ball electrodes. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Refractory State Coding (RSC) {{is a new}} coding {{strategy}} based on a functional model of the stimulated neural population. Our hypothesis is that RSC stimulation would convey {{the information contained in}} acoustic signals more effectively, improving sound perception and hearing performance for speech in noise and music. Two main factors that RSC takes into account are channel interaction [1] and refractory properties [2] of the stimulated neural population. They can be characterized by electrophysiological measurements of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) using “spread of excitation” (SoE) and “recovery function” characterization paradigms respectively [3]. Using this information, for a given stimulus sequence, it is possible to calculate the refractory state of each stimulation site at any given time. In RSC, the stimulus is shaped according to the refractory states of stimulation sites. The spectral representation of the input sound is weighted by the refractory recovery information as well as the electric field distribution function before the next stimulus is selected. The Nucleus 24 and Nucleus Freedom family of cochlear implants incorporate Neural Response Telemetry (NRT) circuitry which is able to conveniently measure the ECAP from the <b>implanted</b> <b>intracochlear</b> electrodes, allowing the model to be custom-fitted to a patient. A software implementation of the standard ACE strategy for the Nucleus Cochlear Implant system is available in the Nucleus Matlab Toolbox.

40|$|The {{cochlear}} implant (CI) {{is a medical}} technology that is widely used to treat hearing loss. In this, current pulses are injected at the electrode pads on the <b>implanted</b> <b>intracochlear</b> electrode array to stimulate the neurons in the modiolus. All the current must travel to the return electrode, which is located remotely {{on the side of}} the head for monopolar (MP) stimulation. Our understanding of the current conduction pathways and voltage distribution resulting from CI stimulation can help improve future designs and implementation strategies. A computational model would serve as a useful tool to improve our understanding of the current conduction pathways and voltage distributions as a result of MP stimulation. However, most of these models are only interested in the local cochlea region and assume particular boundary conditions. For a more reliable result, a Human Electro-Anatomical Total Head Reconstruction (HEATHER) was developed. This finite element (FE) model was created from the female Visible Human Project dataset to include twelve tissues and geometries of the {{cochlear implant}} and electrode array. A simulation of MP stimulation using HEATHER showed that current exits the cochlea via the modiolus, the basal end of the cochlea and the cochlear walls, and travels to the implant via the cranial cavity or scalp. All return locations were similar except for the internal auditory meatus. Blocking the basal end of the cochlea increased current going to the modiolus and cochlear walls. Global voltage distributions were sensitive to tissue resistivities of large tissues (scalp, bone, grey matter). Local voltages are also dependent on boundary conditions. With HEATHER, studies that would otherwise have been difficult or not feasible to perform in vivo can be tested in silico, making it valuable for CI research. Its flexibility allows it to be also used in other fields. The workflow used to generate HEATHER can be applied to other anatomical models.

40|$|Bilateral {{cochlear}} implantation {{seeks to}} restore the advantages of binaural hearing to the profoundly deaf by giving them access to binaural cues normally important for accurate sound localization and speech reception in noise. This thesis characterizes binaural interactions in auditory neurons using a cat model of bilateral cochlear implants. Single neuron responses in the inferior colliculus (IC), the main nucleus of the auditory midbrain, were studied using electric stimulation of bilaterally <b>implanted</b> <b>intracochlear</b> electrode arrays. Neural tuning to interaural timing difference (ITD) was emphasized since {{it is an important}} binaural cue and is well represented in IC neural responses. Stimulation parameters were explored in an effort to find stimuli that might result in the best ITD sensitivity for clinical use. The majority of IC neurons were found to be sensitive to ITD with low-rate constant-amplitude pulse trains. Electric ITD tuning was often as sharp as that with acoustic stimulation in normal-hearing animals, but many neurons had dynamic ranges of ITD sensitivity limited to a few decibels. Consistent with behavioral results in bilaterally implanted humans, neural ITD discrimination thresholds degraded with increasing pulse rates above 100 pulses per second (pps). (cont.) Since cochlear implants typically encode sounds by amplitude modulation (AM) of pulse-train carriers, ITD tuning of IC neurons was also studied using AM pulse trains. Many IC neurons were sensitive to ITD in both the amplitude envelope and temporal fine structure of the AM stimulus. Sensitivity to envelope ITD generally improved with increasing modulation frequency up to 160 Hz. However, the best sensitivity was to fine structure ITD of a moderate-rate (1000 pps) AM pulse train. These results show that bilateral electric stimulation can produce normal ITD tuning in IC neurons and suggest that the interaural timing of current pulses should be accurately controlled if one hopes to design a bilateral cochlear implant processing strategy that provides salient ITD cues. In additional experiments, we found that evoked potentials may be clinically useful for assigning frequency-channel mappings in bilateral implant recipients, such as pediatric patients, for which existing psychophysical methods of matching interaural electrodes are unavailable. by Zachary M.
