5|$|Despite {{the general}} {{reputation}} as a mass producer and a consensus that the region {{is in the midst}} of an economic crisis, parts of the Languedoc wine <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> experiencing commercial success due to outside investment and an increased focus on quality.

Some vineyards have adopted the youngest batch of AOC classifications developed in the late 1990s, while other vineyards eschew designated blends entirely and are instead shifting toward bottling single varietal wines, a practice increasingly demanded by consumers in the large New World wine market.|$|E

5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The afternoon, {{especially}} the early afternoon, {{is associated with}} a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the <b>industry</b> <b>are</b> low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

30|$|Data in {{this thesis}} also include the sales, profit, and {{incremental}} of enterprises. We use {{the average number of}} employees in an enterprise to calculate the average operation index and compare the operational performance between monopoly industries and competition industries. From Table  2 we can see that there are great differentials in operation situations among enterprises in monopoly industries. Although the proportion of enterprises ﻿with﻿ loss﻿ in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> quite high, the proportions of average profit and average incremental are higher than the corresponding index in competition industry. The profit per capita in monopoly <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> 7.8 thousand yuan, while the median of the average profit in enterprises of competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 3.5 thousand yuan; the median of the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 336.1 thousand yuan, while the median for the average sales in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 326 thousand yuan. The average incremental is also a measurement on enterprises’ operation situation. The median of the average incremental in monopoly <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 53.4 thousand yuan, while the median of average incremental in competition <b>industries</b> <b>is</b> 36.6 thousand yuan. As the incremental of financial <b>industry</b> <b>is</b> not calculated and there is lack of data about enterprises’ incremental, the number observed on average incremental is less than other indexes of enterprises.|$|R
