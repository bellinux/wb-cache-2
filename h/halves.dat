40|$|Abstract. We {{deal with}} a divisor class <b>halving</b> {{algorithm}} on hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems (HECC), {{which can be used}} for scalar multiplication, instead of a doubling algorithm. It is not obvious how to construct a <b>halving</b> algorithm, due to the complicated addition formula of hyperelliptic curves. In this paper, we propose the first <b>halving</b> algorithm used for HECC of genus 2, which is as efficient as the previously known doubling algorithm. From the explicit formula of the doubling algorithm, we can generate some equations whose common solutions contain the <b>halved</b> value. From these equations we derive four specific equations and show an algorithm that selects the proper <b>halved</b> value using two trace computations in the worst case. If a base point is fixed, we can reduce these extra field operations by using a pre-computed table which shows the correct <b>halving</b> divisor class — the improvement over the previously known fastest doubling algorithm is up to about 10 %. This <b>halving</b> algorithm is applicable to DSA and DH scheme based on HECC. Finally, we present the divisor class <b>halving</b> algorithms for not only the most frequent case but also other exceptional cases...|$|R

40|$|In a silicon {{wafer-based}} photovoltaic (PV) module, significant {{power is}} lost due to current transport through the ribbons interconnecting neighbour cells. Using <b>halved</b> cells in PV modules {{is an effective}} method to reduce the resistive power loss which has already been applied by some major PV manufacturers (Mitsubishi, BP Solar) in their commercial available PV modules. As a consequence, quantitative analysis of PV modules using <b>halved</b> cells is needed. In this paper we investigate theoretically and experimentally the difference between modules made with <b>halved</b> and full-size solar cells. Theoretically, we find an improvement in fill factor of 1. 8 % absolute and output power of 90 [*]mW for the <b>halved</b> cell minimodule. Experimentally, we find an improvement in fill factor of 1. 3 % absolute and output power of 60 [*]mW for the <b>halved</b> cell module. Also, we investigate theoretically how this effect confers {{to the case of}} large-size modules. It is found that the performance increment of <b>halved</b> cell PV modules is even higher for high-efficiency solar cells. After that, the resistive loss of large-size modules with different interconnection schemes is analysed. Finally, factors influencing the performance and cost of industrial <b>halved</b> cell PV modules are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Diocletian's {{administrative}} reforms had {{the twin}} aims of ensuring political stability and providing the bureaucratic infrastructure needed {{to raise the}} recruits and supplies needed by the army. At the top, Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy. This divided the empire into two <b>halves,</b> East and West, each to be ruled by an Augustus (emperor). Each Augustus would in turn appoint a deputy called a Caesar, who would act both as his ruling partner (each Caesar was assigned {{a quarter of the}} empire) and designated successor. This four-man team would thus have the flexibility to deal with multiple and simultaneous challenges as well as providing for a legitimate succession. The latter failed in its central aim, to prevent the disastrous civil wars caused by the multiple usurpations of the 3rd century. Indeed, the situation may have been made worse, by providing each pretender with a substantial comitatus to enforce his claim. Diocletian himself lived (in retirement) to see his successors fight each other for power. But the division of the empire into Eastern and Western <b>halves,</b> recognising both geographical and cultural realities, proved enduring: it was mostly retained during the 4th century and became permanent after 395.|$|E
