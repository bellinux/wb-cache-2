40|$|Macroscopic {{assemblies}} of semiconductor particles, with {{dimensions in}} the nanometer range, permeated with a transparent conducting phase (nanoporous electrodes) show a useful behavior in {{applications such as}} photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells. A fundamental event in dye-sensitized solar cells is the recombination of photoinjected electrons with acceptor species (ionic holes) in the electrolyte phase surrounding the nanoparticles. Intrinsic semiconductor surface states {{play an important role}} in this process, not only as electron traps but also as intermediate states for electron transfer to the electrolyte (interfacial recombination centers). To describe the electron lifetime of electron trapped at band gap surface states, the concepts developed in the early analysis of recombination processes in photoconductors, such as the <b>demarcation</b> <b>level,</b> are quite useful. However, in photoelectrochemical systems (dye-sensitized solar cell), holes can be identified with oxidized, electrolyte dissolved species so that a new statistical analysis of the interfacial recombination process, considering the distribution of fluctuating, electrolyte energy levels, is required. Moreover, since in dye-sensitized solar cells the quasi-Fermi level for electrons, E Fn, controls both the photovoltage and the rate of electron transport through the porous network, it is of great significance to find a correlation between the traps occupancy and E Fn. We develop a consistent formulation that, fulfilling these requirements, allows to deal with an arbitrary distribution of band gap surface states. Our analysis, which is based on those physica...|$|E

40|$|Abstract An undescribed virus with {{isometric}} {{particles and}} {{a diameter of}} ca. 30 nm was identified in diseased samples of wild and cultivated Rubus species and molecularly characterized. Its genome was 6, 463 nt, excluding the 30 -terminal poly(A) tail, and contained a single open reading frame coding for a 2, 035 -amino-acid-long precursor polypeptide (p 223). The amino terminal portion of p 223, identified as a replication-associated polyprotein, contained conserved motifs of methyltransferase, endopeptidase/protease, helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The carboxy terminus of the large polypeptide {{is involved in the}} formation of two viral coat protein subunits with deduced molecular masses of 23 and 21 kDa. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analyses showed closest relationships of this virus with oat blue dwarf virus and citrus sudden death-associated virus, sharing levels of genome sequence conservation far below the species <b>demarcation</b> <b>level</b> established for tymovirids. Our data indicate that this virus, for which the name blackberry virus S (BlVS) is proposed, is a hitherto undescribed species of the genus Marafivirus, family Tymoviridae.

This research involved development of a prototype that was used to bring all stake holders together in elections through information sharing. It involved customization of the Distributed Geospatial Information System (DGI) to work with basic phones. The prototype was developed using ArcGIS for Desktop in data consolidation and management, ArcGIS for Server in information dissemination, PostgreSQL as a database and Diafaan gateway as an SMS gateway. The prototype enabled an election official or an observer to send elections results or comments that were plotted on the map in form of graphs and pie charts in real-time. The prototype also enabled the citizens at large and other stake holders to send comments or report elections incidences that were also plotted on the map at the respective polling stations. The research found that all mobile phones owned by Kenyans can effectively be used with DGI applications to enable citizen and stake holder’s participations. The prototype had shortcomings, especially where some polling stations share the first name. There was need to further develop the prototype to allow addition of constituency name followed by ward name then followed by the polling station name. This will lock a given polling station in the correct constituency. Another way will be to use the polling station code...|$|E

30|$|Satellite-derived dNBR is most {{commonly}} stratified into four burn severity categories (high, moderate, and low severities; and no detected change), with subsequent {{analysis performed on}} the four classification levels or upon the simple area burned (Miller and Thode 2007, Miller et al. 2008, Lutz et al. 2009 a). <b>Demarcations</b> between severity <b>levels</b> are ideally determined after extensive ground verification {{of the effect of}} fire on each vegetation type (e.g., Thode et al. 2011). Classifying severity data without detailed ground information has the potential to distort the interpretation of fire severity, particularly in the highest and lowest classifications, or where vegetation types or stand ages are closely intermixed. Furthermore, classification of any continuous variable into discrete bins sacrifices information and, thereby, increases noise in subsequent analyses. Classification is also sensitive to potentially differing interpretations made by remote sensing analysts and field ecologists (Spies et al. 2010), suggesting that a statistical approach would be more robust, at least for sufficiently large areas (Hudak et al. 2007).|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{development}} of assays for stress in marine fishes {{is vital for}} studying the impacts of bycatch in fisheries and for determining the health of fish being cultured or used in research. This research developed behavioral and physiological assays for stress in juvenile sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, a species that comprises a valuable North Pacific fishery and is often {{a substantial part of}} incidental discard. The effects of conditions, intrinsic or extrinsic to the fish, on the variability of the stress response were also investigated. A moderate stress of 15 minutes in air was used to elicit an acute stress response. Behavioral responses and physiological values were evaluated at 1, 5, and 24 hours after the 15 minute air stress, and were compared with control fish that received only a minimal air stress. In the first series of experiments, behavioral patterns and changes in behavior over time of stressed and control fish were determined, and the protocols and time course for measuring behavioral effects of stress were established. In the second series of experiments, physiological assays were added to the behavioral protocols developed during the first series of experiments. The behavioral assays included activity levels, swimming speed at capture, and appetitive behavioral patterns in response to a chemical food stimulus (squid extract), and to a visual food stimulus (squid without odor). These behaviors are ecologically relevant in terms of performance and survival. All of these behaviors were sensitive to stress. In general, behavioral responses were depressed by stress at 1 hour, followed by recovery to control levels by 5 hours. However, the intensity of behavioral responses was affected by feeding history (1 or 5 days of food deprivation) and group influence (recovering alone or in visual contact with 3 conspecifics), which therefore affected the ability of the behavioral responses to assess stress. The behavioral assays were less capable of detecting differences between stressed and control fish when the responses of control fish were depressed as a consequence ofbeing fed the day before. Visual contact with conspecifics facilitated recovery of activity in stressed fish, but therefore also resulted in apparent activity responses to chemical food stimulus that were more likely attributable to activity increases of conspecifics than to appetitive behavior. The focus of attention of isolated fish on activity of conspecifics often interfered with visual detection of food. The physiological assays included plasma concentrations of cortisol, glucose, and lactate, all of which proved to be sensitive measures of stress in sablefish. These parameters were elevated by stress at 1 hour, followed by a decreasing trend to 5 and 24 hours. The physiological assays were affected by feeding history, and an effect of group influence was also indicated. Cortisol and lactate levels in stressed fish fed the day before recovered faster than for stressed fish that were deprived of food for 5 days. Glucose levels in stressed fish fed the day before were not elevated above controls. These results suggested an alleviating effect of feeding on the biochemical stress response. At 5 hours, cortisol and glucose were elevated above baseline levels in both solitary stressed fish and in stressed fish influenced by a group, but also for controls influenced by a group, suggesting an exacerbating effect of isolated fish being in visual contact with groups. There were critical cortisol, glucose and lactate thresholds (180 ng/ml, 140 mg/dl, and 175 mg/dl, respectively) above which no appetitive behavioral responses occurred. These clear <b>demarcation</b> <b>levels</b> are extremely valuable for linking behavioral and physiological responses. These results indicate that behavioral and physiological assays are sensitive indicators of stress in sablefish, although the magnitude, time courses, and correlation of responses may be affected by factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the fish that may vary before and during recovery. There was a correspondence between behavioral and physiological indications of stress shortly after the stressor had been removed and levels of stress were still severe. However, there was a temporal discrepancy after partial recovery had occurred, at which time recovery of physiological norms had not yet been established although behavioral responses had recovered. While behavioral patterns may readjust quickly, the persistence of an energetic load during recovery from stress, as indicated by continued physiological perturbations, may compromise ability to respond to additional stressors...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{alignment}} of F 0 movements {{has shown that}} they align with the segmental string. This is the “segmental anchoring” hypothesis. In addition, research on the duration of segments {{at the edges of}} prosodic domains has shown that duration is a robust cue for the <b>demarcation</b> of prosodic <b>levels,</b> however, the exact operation of those cues under different conditions is still a matter of research. This paper addresses the question of how {{the alignment}} of F 0 of prenuclear pitch accents and the duration of segments in Prosodic Words of Greek might interact, when produced under different prosodic boundary and lexical stress placements. We used Prosodic Words of the short “article + noun + clitic”, bearing an L*+H prenuclear pitch accent. From the results {{for the duration of the}} segments of the prosodic word we did not find support for mechanisms that have been found to operate on other languages, such as English and Dutch. The mechanisms examined were those of preboundary lengthening, polysyllabic shortening, accentual lengthening and articulatory strengthening. We found that the proclitic is shorter than the enclitic, which indicated a shortening of the proclitic. We also showed that the distance of the stress and pitch accent from the prosodic boundary causes a change on the duration of the segments of the noun of the prosodic word. That is, segments belonging to a word with stress further away from the boundary are longer than the ones with stress closer to the boundary. Regarding the alignment of F 0 movements, we found that the Low tone aligns with the onset of the accented syllable, but is influenced by the existence of a word boundary. Surprisingly, we found that the H tone is not influenced by the existence of a prosodic boundary and aligns after the onset of the first postaccentual vowel, regardless of whether the clitic is a proclitic or an enclitic. Position of stress seemed to influence the alignment of the F 0 movements as well, since when the pitch accent lay further away from the prosodic boundary there was more time for the rise from L to H to take place...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} vowel recognition in coarticulatory theory and phonology by assessing how early vowel quality can be recognised from English onset plosives realised with aspiration. Particular {{attention is paid to}} aspects of production and perception timing. A gating experiment was used to assess how reliably listeners can recognise English monophthongs. The treatment of coarticulation distinguishes between phonetic and phonological aspects of production and perception, with a clear <b>demarcation</b> between these <b>levels</b> of representation. The results are interpreted through the lens of prosodic phonology, as this framework constrains the grammar more optimally than segmental-phonemic ones and better exemplifies listeners’ sensitivity to the distribution of FPD. Velar and bilabial onsets give rise to significantly more correct responses than alveolars, which require more precise articulations. High vowels are recognised more reliably than low ones. This result is due to their intrinsically shorter duration, making high vowels less variable through time. This perceptual link is proportionate to the total amount of variation in vowel inherent spectral change (VISC), which corresponds to spectro-temporal variation in formant centre frequencies through time in vowel realisations. Nasal rimes give rise to a smaller proportion of correct responses than non-nasal rimes, especially in the context of high and low front vowels: the VISC and changes in vowel height undergone in the context of such articulations, as well as the phonetic consequences of the overall articulatory constellation shape the resulting percept. CVCs with non-nasal rimes give rise to more correct responses than CVVs, despite there being more articulations on-going: the shortness of the vowel in CVCs compensates for this deficit, making perception more robust. Word frequency does not {{have a significant effect on}} recognition for any of the syllable types investigated. Overall, a much larger temporal window than the phoneme is required for the robust processing and perceptual integration of speech. Phonemes alone cannot adequately define how the relationship between the phonetic co-extensiveness of different sounds and feature sharing is to be accounted for in speech understanding. Since articulators are in constant motion during production, and consonantal gestures have distinctive coarticulatory influences over vocalic ones, the formant frequencies for both types of sound are in constant flux. This variation reinforces perceptual cohesion and has systematic effects on the mapping of FPD, through which larger structures become audible...|$|R
40|$|THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS: AN ANALYSIS OF ITS USES AND SOURCES. The aim {{with this}} thesis is {{to clarify the}} {{principle}} of subsidiarity {{and its role in}} the European integration process; what it is and where it comes from. "Subsidiarity" is a word that has been used in the context of European integration since the mid- 1970 s. It did, however, rarely surface from its relative obscurity before the the work on the Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) came to a close in 1992. It was included in this treaty in a manner that was less than clear and left ample room for discussion of its meaning. After the ratification problems of the Treaty materialized, subsidiarity was seen by anxious European politicians as a major selling point of the Treaty towards a sceptic public in several EU member states. It was emphasized that the principle meant that only those matters that could not be handled at the national level would be transfered to the Community level. The word "nearness" was much in vogue at the time as a synonym for "subsidiarity", meaning that decisions should be taken as close to the citizens as possible. "Nearness" is however only one aspect of the subsidiarity principle. Subsidiarity also means that decision-making competence can flow the other way, from local and national levels to the supranational, European, level. As politicians and bureaucrats tried to reach a common understanding of subsidiarity it became increasingly clear that there were fundamentally different perceptions in the EU of what subsidiarity implies. Specifically, some, like the German government under preassure from the Länder. argued that subsidiarity should not only be valid for the relationship between the member states and the Community, but also within the member states. Others, examplified by the UK government, objected strongly to this. Both sides could refer to articles from the Maastricht Treaty supporting their views Another dispute concerned which criterion was to be used to decide what was the "best" level for decision-making. Again Germany and the UK was at loggerheads. Germany wanted an ''efficiency approach", which would mean a lower threshold for Community action than the "necessity approach" favoured by the British. Another aspect of the subsidiarity principle over which there was some discussion was the role of the Court of Justice. Subsidiarity seems {{to be one of the}} battlefields in the struggle between those who want the Community to develop into a United States of Europe on one hand, and those who want the Community to remain a confederation where the member states keep their power of veto over most issues. Whether the application ofthe principle will also have any lasting impact of the workings of the EU, is still too early to say. The EU is a federal political system Hence the need for some kind of <b>demarcation</b> between the <b>levels</b> of decision-making. Every federal system 7 by definition, has the need for some guidelines to decide what powers and competences should be placed where. Germany is the only federation where subsidiarity has played an explicit role in this process 7 but the "bottom up" approach to distribution of competence that characterizes the principle of subsidiarity is typical among federations. Indeed 7 the concepts "subsidiarity" and "federalism" are closely related. The development of the principle of subsidiarity is closely linked to the Catholic church. The word "subsidiarity" was first used in a papal encyclical in 19317 but the principle had implicitely featured in Catholic social doctrine at least since the latter half of the 19 th century with roots going back much longer. The principle of subsidiarity in its original Catholic setting 7 and the one used in the present context of European integration are not the same, but several aspects of the former have found their way in to the EU's laws...|$|R
