5000|$|Hartnup {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} nutritional disorder resulting in niacin deficiency. [...] This condition was first identified in the 1950s by the Hartnup family in London. It {{is due to a}} deficit in the intestines and kidneys, making it difficult for the body to break down and absorb dietary tryptophan. The resulting condition is similar to pellagra, including symptoms of red, scaly rash, and sensitivity to sunlight. Oral niacin is given as a treatment for this condition in doses ranging from 40-200 mg, with a good prognosis if identified and treated early. Niacin synthesis is also deficient in carcinoid syndrome, because <b>of</b> metabolic <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> its <b>precursor</b> tryptophan to form serotonin.|$|R

5000|$|The World Drug {{report is}} an {{extensive}} and comprehensive document. The first substantive {{piece of the}} report is the preface which is written by the UNODC Executive Director and gives readers insight into the purposes of publishing this research. Next is the explanatory notes which provides readers with definitions of the acronyms and abbreviations within the report. In addition, it notes how the UNODC distinguished borders in terms of international drug trafficking and that the UNODC measures drug values in United States Currency (USD). Next is the executive summary, which gives a heavily condensed overview {{of the findings of}} the report and includes data and graphs. Using the 2014 report as an example, data from the report is formatted in the following way:After the preface, explanatory notes, and executive summary, the World Drug Report has two main sections. The first section is titled “Research Statistics and Trend Analysis of Illicit Drug Materials” and has several subsections. There are subsections for the following categories: global extent of drug use, health and social impacts of drugs, regional drug use trends, overview of opiate data, overview of cocaine data, overview of cannabis data, overview of amphetamine-type stimulant data, and overview of psychoactive substances data. The second section is centered around a relevant topic as determined by information compiled in the accumulation of research and data. For example, the 2014 report’s second category is titled, “Precursor Control”. It contains the following subsections: an introduction, a description <b>of</b> <b>precursor</b> chemicals, the potential vulnerability of the chemical industry to the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>precursor</b> chemicals, the response from the international community, trends in precursor chemicals, key precursors in the manufacturing of illicit drugs, and concluding remarks.

2500|$|China is a {{major source}} <b>of</b> <b>precursor</b> {{chemicals}} necessary {{for the production of}} cocaine, heroin, MDMA and crystal methamphetamine, which are used by many Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim nations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} inhibitors of gluthathione (GSH) synthesis, namely gamma-methyl glutamic acid, D-glutamic acid, cystamine, methionine-S-sulfoximine (MSX), buthionine-S-sulfoximine, and GSH itself, on the {{emission}} of H 2 S was investigated. All these compounds stimulated H 2 S emission from pumpkin leaf discs {{in response to}} sulfate. MSX and GSH were the most effective compounds, stimulating H 2 S emission from leaf discs of mature pumpkin leaves by about 80 % in response to sulfate. Both inhibitors did not appreciably enhance H 2 S emission in response to sulfite. Treatment with MSX or GSH enhanced the uptake of sulfate by pumpkin leaf discs, but {{did not affect the}} incorporation of sulfate into reduced sulfur compounds. Inhibition of GSH synthesis by MSX or GSH caused an increase in the pool size of cysteine, and, simultaneously, reduced the incorporation of labeled sulfate into cysteine. The incorporation of labeled sulfate into the sulfite and sulfide pools of the cells are stimulated under thes e conditions. These observations are consistent with the idea that inhibition of GSH synthesis leads to an elevated cysteine pool that inhibits further cysteine synthesis. The H 2 S emitted under these conditions appears to arise from <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> a <b>precursor</b> <b>of</b> the sulfur moiety of L-cysteine. Therefore, stimulation of H 2 S emission in response to sulfate upon inhibition of GSH synthesis may reflect a role of H 2 S emission in keeping the cysteine concentration below a critical level.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} <b>of</b> illicit <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> {{pharmaceutical products}} is a worldwide problem associated with negative health consequences {{and with other}} crimes. The illicit <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceuticals containing the active ingredient pseudoephedrine is of concern, primarily due to the role this substance plays {{in the manufacture of}} synthetic illicit drugs such as methylamphetamine. There are a range of strategies employed to curb the problem <b>of</b> <b>precursor</b> <b>diversion.</b> Not least is the development of strategies involving front-line health professionals such as community pharmacists {{to play an important role}} in reducing the incidence <b>of</b> <b>diversion.</b> Objectives: This study aimed to examine levels of pharmacist engagement in an intervention expected to decrease <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> pseudoephedrine products from community pharmacies. The primary objective was to explore levels of community pharmacist engagement with the intervention and to explore their perceptions of intervention effectiveness. Methods: A survey instrument was developed to examine six main areas relating to the implementation, operation and outcomes of the intervention, in addition to the roles performed by community pharmacists in two Australian State jurisdictions. The respondent pharmacists were recruited through a combination of email and facsimile communications from thePharmacyGuild ofAustralia and through an electronic pharmacy newsletter. Results: Thirty percent of eligible community pharmacies in the study jurisdictions responded to the survey. The results of the survey highlight that in the absence of an alternative strategy to assist community pharmacists to reduce pseudoephedrine <b>diversion,</b> the majority <b>of</b> respondents were satisfied with the effectiveness of the police-pharmacy intervention. It was found that a pharmacist's positive perception of the role police played in the intervention strongly influenced their engagement in the strategy. Conclusion: Identifying the factors that significantly influence pharmacist engagement in this strategy has broader implications for other law enforcement-public health strategies. It is important for policy models to incorporate these significant elements in their design to enhance the implementation, operation and outcomes of prevention-type interventions.
