5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to producing, Tedder sings lead vocals and plays guitar and piano for the band, OneRepublic. The five member band consisting of Tedder, Zach Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Drew Brown, and Brent Kutzle {{was formed in}} Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002 by Tedder and his high school classmate Zach Filkins. Tedder has since revealed that the band was formed at a [...] "crossroads" [...] in his life: [...] "I was offered two publishing deals within two months of being in Nashville...I could have just written songs and lived a carefree life, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be an artist. I wanted to form a rock band and create my own sound." [...] Based in Los Angeles, OneRepublic started out as an unsigned act on the social networking website, MySpace. Since June 2004, they have accumulated over fifty million plays for their music on the site. As of 2009, they are the number-one band on MySpace and {{have been in the}} MySpace Music's Top Artists since the summer of 2006.|$|E
2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really like to say that I spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist". Sébastien Huberdeau, the Tim Canterbury equivalent, was seen on international screens in The Barbarian Invasions, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. On {{the way back to}} pit lane, Buemi declared to commentator Dario Franchitti his satisfaction with his success but admitted the victory was handed to him [...] "on a plate" [...] He later felt Rosenqvist was the deserving victor but was happy with the pace of his car: [...] "I think we were {{more or less the same}} pace [...] I’m very happy with that result, it just tastes a little bit different than normal." [...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve. There is still a couple of tenths we need to find to be able to fight [...]" ...|$|E
