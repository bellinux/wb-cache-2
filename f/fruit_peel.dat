40|$|Acne can {{be caused}} by Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using {{antibiotic}} for the acne theraphy in a long term period can cause resistance, organ detriment and imunohypersensitivity. Red dragon <b>fruit’s</b> <b>peel</b> (Hylocereus polyrhizus) is one of natural materials which can be used for alternative antibacterial. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the antibacterial activity of n-Hexane fraction of red dragon <b>fruit’s</b> <b>peel</b> against S. epidermidis dan P. acnes with the method of disc diffusion Kirby-Bauer. Red dragon <b>fruit’s</b> <b>peel</b> powder was macerated with chloroform and then fractionated with n-Hexane. The result of phytochemical screening showed that red dragon <b>fruit’s</b> <b>peel</b> contained terpenoid and alkaloid. Clindamycin 4 µg/disk was used for positive control while DMSO 10 % was used for negative control. Data was analyzed using R-Commander program 3. 0. 3 version. This research showed that n-Hexane fraction of red dragon <b>fruit’s</b> <b>peel</b> had antibacterial activity against P. acnes where the average zone of inhibition obtained from the concentrations of 20; 40; and 80 mg/mL were 9 mm; 10, 25 mm; and 10, 5 mm, respectively.

Batch adsorption mode was selected and adsorption was studied {{as a function}} of time till equilibrium between adsorbate and adsorbent was achieved. The present study reflects its significance in using <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> discarded as wastes as potential alternative to control the pollutants and reduce the volume of solid waste to be managed. Acid digested industrial wastewater samples indicated high concentration of Pb, Ni and Cd then permissible limits as per NEQ’s for industrial effluents, thus calling for control measures.

The adsorbents characterization by FTIR spectra, records peak assigned to the presence of –OH, –C=O, –COO and –C–O indicates the involvement of these functional group in binding of metals to the surface of adsorbents.

30|$|The {{potential}} of waste <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> {{has also been}} suggested for various applications [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Pathak et al. [21] suggested the use of <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> (banana, citrus, orange, and jackfruit) for the extraction of some valuable compounds (such as phenolic antioxidants, carboxylic acid, enzymes, and bioactive chemicals), energy generation (bio-methane, bio-hydrogen, gasification, bio-oil, bio-ethanol, etc.), bio-adsorbents, and bio-fertilizers. <b>Fruit</b> <b>peels</b> contain 3 % phenolic compounds, 0.8 – 9 % lignin, 9 – 59 % cellulose, and 8 – 17 % hemicelluloses, along with high C and H contents. All these compositions make them suitable for the above-said application areas. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no such report on the electrochemical {{potential of}} <b>fruit</b> <b>peels</b> or other kitchen waste exists. This sets up the motivation to undertake the current research work. To utilize the solid waste of our institute, we have utilized the hostel (dormitories) and university eateries kitchen waste and processed it scientifically to synthesize valuable PCM which could be used for electrochemical as well as other applications. An organic manure was prepared, by decomposing kitchen waste into soil, and further poultry faeces were also added to it to make it nutrient rich (N in specific). A high-temperature treatment of this organic manure gives rise to PCM. Our approach is unique and innovative to discard kitchen wastage (<b>fruits</b> and vegetable <b>peels,</b> tea, eggs, etc.) and get something very valuable which could have the potential to replace costlier Pt/C as an electrocatalyst in an FC. The results have been characterized via FESEM, BET, EDX, XRD, FTIR, CV, and LSV studies.|$|R

40|$|Isoflavones are legume-specific {{flavonoids}} {{best known}} for their potential cancer preventive and phytoestrogenic properties. In this study, we attempted to engineer the isoflavone pathway in the popular fruit crop tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L). Tomato plants were transformed with a soybean (Glycine max L) isoflavone synthase (GmIFS 2) cDNA {{under the control of}} the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated the presence of genistin (genistein 7 -O-glucoside) as the major isoflavone metabolite in the transgenic plants. Substantial amounts of genistin (up to 90 nmol/g FW) were found in leaves, while the levels were marginally detectable (less than 0. 5 nmol/g FW) in <b>fruit</b> <b>peels.</b> In either case, no drastic variations in endogenous phenolic contents were observed. <b>Fruit</b> <b>peels</b> were found to accumulate high levels of naringenin chalcone, implicating the limitation of naringenin substrates for isoflavone synthesis. Our results suggested that tomato plants could be engineered to produce isoflavones without comprising the levels of endogenous flavonols, which are also health-beneficial, but it may be necessary to enhance the expression levels of chalcone isomerase simultaneously to achieve significant yields in edible tissues such as <b>fruit</b> <b>peels.</b> © 2008 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
