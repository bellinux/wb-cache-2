5|$|In {{the early}} seventeenth century famine was {{relatively}} common, with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625. The English invasions of the 1640s {{had a profound}} impact on the Scottish economy, with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century. Under the Commonwealth, the country was relatively highly taxed, but gained access to English markets. After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re-established, along with its customs duties. Economic conditions were generally favourable from 1660 to 1688, as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle-raising. The monopoly of royal burghs over foreign trade was partially ended by and Act of 1672, leaving them with the old luxuries of wines, silk, spices and dyes and opening up trade of increasingly significant salt, coal, corn and hides and imports from the Americas. The English Navigation Acts limited the ability of the Scots to engage in what would have been lucrative trading with England's growing colonies, but these were often circumvented, with Glasgow becoming an increasingly important commercial centre, opening up trade with the American colonies: importing sugar from the West Indies and tobacco from Virginia and Maryland. Exports across the Atlantic included linen, woollen goods, coal and <b>grindstones.</b> The English protective tariffs on salt and cattle were harder to disregard and probably placed greater limitations on the Scottish economy, despite attempts of the King to have them overturned. Scottish attempts to counter this with tariffs of their own were largely unsuccessful, as Scotland had relatively few vital exports to protect. Attempts by the Privy Council to build up luxury industries in cloth mills, soap works, sugar boiling houses, gunpowder and paper works, also proved largely unsuccessful. However, by the end of the century the drovers roads, on which black cattle were driven from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England, had become firmly established.|$|E

The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe, partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century, with only one year of dearth (in 1674) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind.|$|E

25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held <b>grindstones.</b> The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (triticum aestivum) replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E
25|$|From {{a man in}} Iowa, Walker heard {{good things}} about Minneapolis, Minnesota, and moved there in 1862.

Within one hour of his arrival in Minneapolis, he {{was hired as a}} chainman to George B. Wright, who was surveying federal pine lands in the north of the state. He became a deputy surveyor within a few days. His application to become assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin had been accepted but he loved his new career and turned it down. Walker worked for twelve years on government surveys and on surveys for the St. Paul and Duluth Railroad. His work took him away from home for long periods, and it gave him intricate knowledge of what property to buy in northern Minnesota. He began to acquire pine land in 1867, but without capital of his own, he partnered at first with Dr. Levi Butler and Howard W. Mills and later with others.|$|E
500|$|After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31, 1828, {{they moved}} to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County, Ohio in April of that year. It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James Gilbrith, a disciple of Josiah Holbrook who wanted to found a lyceum village. In the village, {{which was founded in}} 1837 and {{situated}} just north of his farm, Baldwin ran the Lyceum Village School for five years until June 1842, when it went bankrupt. However, one day while walking home, he had an impulse to take a new route across the river on his farm. He noticed a grouping of exposed rocks, which would make superior <b>grindstones.</b> This {{was the beginning of the}} Berea grindstone industry. Baldwin shipped his <b>grindstones</b> to Cleveland by ox carts. After the Big Four Railroad was built from Cleveland to Cincinnati, Baldwin built a railroad which would connect his quarries to the Big Four Depot.

500|$|Saint Anthony Falls, {{the only}} {{waterfall}} of its height on the Mississippi, {{played an important}} part in the development of Minneapolis. [...] The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. [...] In 1870, {{only a small number of}} flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. [...] Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. [...] Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. [...] To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. [...] They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. [...] They also started using roller mills, as opposed to <b>grindstones.</b> [...] A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. [...] These improvements led to the production of [...] "patent" [...] flour, which commanded almost double the price of [...] "bakers" [...] or [...] "clear" [...] flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. [...] This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region.|$|E
500|$|The St. Anthony Express {{newspaper}} {{predicted in}} 1855 that, [...] "The {{time is not}} distant when Minnesota, with the superiority of her soil and seasons for wheat culture, and her unparalleled water power for manufacturing flour, will export largely of this article. ... our mills will turn out wheat, superior in quality and appearance to any now manufactured in the West." [...] By 1876, eighteen flour mills had been built {{on the west side}} of the river below the falls. The first mills used traditional technology of millstones that would pulverize the grain and grind as much flour as possible in one pass. This system worked best for winter wheat, which was sown in the fall and resumed its growth in the spring. However, the harsh winter conditions of the upper Midwest did not lend themselves to the production of winter wheat, since the deep frosts and lack of snow cover killed the crop. Spring wheat, which could be sown in the spring and reaped in the summer, was a more dependable crop. However, conventional milling techniques did not produce a desirable product, since the harder husks of spring wheat kernels fractured between the <b>grindstones.</b> The gluten and starch in the flour could not be mixed completely, either, and the flour would turn rancid. Minneapolis milling companies solved this problem by inventing the middlings purifier, which made it possible to separate the husks from the flour earlier in the milling process. They also developed a gradual-reduction process, where grain was pulverized between a series of rollers made of porcelain, iron, or steel. This process resulted in [...] "patent" [...] flour, which commanded almost double the price of [...] "bakers" [...] or [...] "clear" [...] flour, which it replaced. The Washburn mill attempted to monopolize these techniques, but Pillsbury and other companies lured employees away from Washburn and were able to duplicate the process.|$|E
