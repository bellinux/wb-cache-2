5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently be able to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply {{in addition to the}} relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital it needed to fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary money.|$|E

5|$|The European Council on Foreign Relations {{and analysts}} suggest the Eurasian Union {{includes}} strategic interests {{as well as}} economic interests for its member states, especially Russia. In order to link both Europe and East Asia, Russia seeks to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> eastern regions to increase its access to Asian markets. Russia’s Far East has gained even more importance due to its proximity to alternative markets since the European Union and United States imposed sanctions on Russia following the crisis in Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{learned about}} Croatia's {{intention}} to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own military force from JNA Captain Vladimir Jager, a double agent employed by Croatia and the JNA Counterintelligence Service (KOS). The JNA devised Operation Shield (Štit), aimed at disarming the Croatian {{forces and the}} arrest and trial of the Croatian leadership, in response. Although the operation was prepared by December 1990, federal Defence Minister General Veljko Kadijević never sought authorisation {{to carry it out}} from the Yugoslav Presidency. Instead, he ordered the KOS to stand down on the morning the operation was scheduled to begin.|$|E
5|$|The first {{municipal}} council of Gaza {{was formed in}} 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa. Modern mayorship, however, began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by the Ottoman authorities. Al-Shawa oversaw the construction of Gaza's first hospital, several new mosques and schools, {{the restoration of the}} Great Mosque, and the introduction of the modern plow to the city. In 1922, British colonial secretary Winston Churchill requested that Gaza <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own constitution under Mandatory Palestine. However, it was rejected by the Palestinians.|$|E

Among the largest employers of Arlington residents are the Boeing Everett Factory and Naval Station Everett. The expansion of the aerospace industry in the Seattle region led Arlington to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own municipal airport into an aerospace job center, which includes {{a high concentration of}} Boeing subcontractors. , the airport has 130 on-site businesses that employ 590 people, with a total output of $94.5 million annually.|$|E
5|$|Then, late in 1983, the U.S. {{government}} made a financial commitment to help Israel <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own new fighter, the IAI Lavi. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi {{would be a}} potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor. Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop's complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government.|$|E
5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E

NEC {{had been the first}} to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips finally arrived towards the end of that year.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> leadership.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and fastening systems were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E
5|$|Patton left France for New York City on March 2, 1919. After {{the war he}} was {{assigned}} to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to his permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920, though he was promoted to major again the next day. Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 tank design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1919, Patton met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career. During and following Patton's assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower corresponded frequently. Patton sent Eisenhower notes and assistance to help him graduate from the General Staff College. With Christie, Eisenhower, {{and a handful of other}} officers, Patton pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. These thoughts resonated with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> armored corps much until 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Meridian Council for the Arts (MCA) {{was founded}} as Meridian's and Lauderdale County's {{official}} arts agency in 1978. MCA operates its Community Art Grants program, the annual Threefoot Festival, several workshops, {{and other special}} events each year. MCA is partnered with many arts organizations {{in the city and}} county including the Meridian Museum of Art, the Meridian Little Theatre, and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra. Meridian Little Theatre, one of the South's oldest subscription-based community theatres, was built in 1932 and currently provides entertainment to residents of and visitors to Meridian and Lauderdale County, entertaining over 22,000 guests each season, making it Mississippi's most-attended community theatre. The Meridian Symphony Orchestra (MSO) – founded in 1961 – played its first concert in 1962 and its first full season in 1963. In 1965 the MSO booked its first international soloist, Elena Nikolaidi, to perform with the orchestra. The Orchestra helped the Meridian Public School District <b>develop</b> <b>its</b> own orchestra and strings programs and also helped develop the Meridian Symphony Chorus. The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who has been with the orchestra since 1991. The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
