500|$|For dream {{sequences}} in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring {{practical effects}} whenever possible. Nolan said, [...] "It's always very <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{do as much}} as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically." [...] To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to [...] "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the Silver Age Kathy Kane, who was romantically {{attracted}} to Batman, {{the new version}} of Kane is a lesbian. Her sexual orientation was announced {{at the same time}} the character was revealed in the spring of 2006. Stories appeared on television news outlets such as CNN, general news magazines such as USA Today, and gay culture magazines such as Out. The modern Katherine [...] "Kate" [...] Kane made her first comic book appearance in issue #7 of the maxi-series 52 (2006), where Kane is revealed to have been romantically involved with Renee Montoya, a former Gotham City Police detective (who later takes up the mantle of the Question after the original hero dies). When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again when you have the Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{attended}} Catholic University {{where she}} majored in vocal {{music education and}} also spent time in activities and classes related to the University's drama and musical theater programs. Blackwell said, [...] "I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to pursue classical or musical theater. I knew that whichever I chose, I {{wanted to have a}} classical training. It was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have the technical expertise as well as also the theory and understanding of classical music. Catholic University was the best of both possible worlds, because they had a very strong drama department as well as a very good music department. They were next door, so I spent quite a bit of time going {{back and forth between the}} drama department and the music department." [...] After graduating with her undergraduate degree in 1977, Blackwell taught music in two parochial schools while simultaneously continuing her vocal studies on the graduate level at Catholic University. She graduated with a Masters in Vocal Performance in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|People with a dismissive {{style of}} avoidant {{attachment}} {{tend to agree}} with these statements: [...] "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", [...] "It is [...] <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> feel independent and self-sufficient", and [...] "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." [...] People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the defensive character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive–avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with rejection by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments).|$|E
2500|$|Guadagnino has {{described}} Call Me By Your Name as a family-oriented film {{for the purpose}} of [...] "transmission of knowledge and hope that people of different generations come to see the film together." [...] He never saw it as a [...] "gay" [...] movie, but rather calls it a film about the [...] "beauty of the newborn idea of desire, unbiased and uncynical," [...] and reflects his motto of living [...] "with a sense of joie de vivre." [...] The director attempted to avoid the flaws he had seen in most coming-of-age films, in which growth is often portrayed as a result of resolving certain preconceived dilemmas, like choosing between two lovers. He also wanted the story to follow two people in the moment, rather than focus on an antagonist or a tragedy, a specific approach inspired by À Nos Amours (1983), directed by Maurice Pialat. As someone who considers sex in film a representation of the characters' behavior and identity, Guadagnino wasn't interested in including explicit sex scenes in the film, {{in order to keep the}} tone as planned, saying, [...] "I wanted the audience to completely rely on the emotional travel of these people and feel first love [...] It was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> create this powerful universality, because the whole idea of the movie is that the other person makes you beautiful — enlightens you, elevates you." ...|$|E
