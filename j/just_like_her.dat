5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving me crazy <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Gavin Volure" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy, in a voice over, talks about the Edison Terrace—located in the rooftop gardens of the General Electric Building. [...] "It's a private rooftop garden reserved for the CEOs of this company. The inner temple of American business. The only outsider ever admitted is a mute cleaning lady who has never laid with a man." [...] The scene features six men, including fictional CEO of General Electric on the show, Don Geiss (Rip Torn). In the second scene, Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) intern (Liz Holtan) is excited to work with her and tells her that she wants to be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her.</b> Jenna believes the intern wants to become an actress, prompting her to pull the intern's earring off. The latter scene was included in the October 15, 2009, 30 Rock episode [...] "Season 4".|$|E
500|$|Her {{performance}} in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), {{a film about}} the Crusades where she played Sibylla of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began. Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and she liked the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter. To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance: [...] "She doesn't quite {{know what to do}} with her character's stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice." [...] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character [...] "limp". Green was satisfied when her character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut. Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance: [...] "In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he's afflicted with leprosy <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he's been crowned king." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E

She fires a shot at a figure moving behind Mulder, and he then sees Scully in front of him, and a wounded Linda behind him. In Skinner's office, Linda Bowman's brain scan shows an advanced temporal lobe tumor, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>her</b> fraternal twin, Robert Modell; the two had been separated at birth. Mulder has misgivings about nearly killing Scully and feels that he ultimately lost Linda's game.|$|E

On the situation, Robbie said [...] "She's a hopeless romantic and wants the happily ever after – not only with Ringo, but with her family." [...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E

[...] As for Ndegeocello's appearance, Mellencamp said: [...] "I didn't know what I wanted to sing with <b>her,</b> but I <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>her</b> spirit, so I asked her to come in.

[...] 50 Cent referenced Carey's denial of the relationship on a track called [...] "All of Me" [...] from his third studio album Curtis in 2007: [...] "Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it / He said women from Hollywood they liars, liars, liars / You fuck them, they get you heated, deny it like Mariah." [...] Two years later, Eminem released a song called [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad", on which he took aim at Carey's husband Nick Cannon by calling him a [...] "prick" [...] and wishing him [...] "luck with the fucking whore". The lead single from Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel was [...] "Obsessed". Many critics believed the track to be about Eminem, and its accompanying music video portrayed Carey being followed by a male stalker which critics also thought bore a strong resemblance to the rapper. Mansfield thought that the lyrical content of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{appeared to be a}} continuation of [...] "Obsessed" [...] and her feud with Eminem, as Carey sings [...] "I know you're not a rapper, so you better stop spittin' it." ...|$|E

Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
