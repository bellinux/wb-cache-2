5|$|Civil Aeronautics Board {{investigators}} {{concluded that}} the outer portion of the wing had detached {{from the rest of}} the wing. The investigation revealed a <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> 7/8inch long and 3/32inch deep at the point of detachment. Similar cracks were found on the wing root fittings of another Martin 2-0-2 aircraft that flew the same flight path through the same storm shortly after Flight 421. October inspections of three other Martin 2-0-2 aircraft revealed identical fatigue cracks in similar locations.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> {{also called}} {{crocodile}} cracking or alligator cracking, {{is a common}} type of distress in asphalt pavement. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is characterized by interconnecting or interlaced cracking in the asphalt layer resembling the hide of a crocodile. Cell sizes can vary in size up to 11.80 in across, but are typically less than 5.90 in across. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is generally a loading failure, but numerous factors can contribute to it. It is often a sign of sub-base failure, poor drainage, or repeated over-loadings. It is important to prevent <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> and repair as soon as possible, as advanced cases can be very costly to repair {{and can lead to}} formation of potholes or premature pavement failure.|$|R

25|$|The {{fracture}} surfaces on {{the outer}} part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main spar boom attachment socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> had initiated in weld metal on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the weld metal during {{a large number of}} flights, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> {{at the time of the}} accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.|$|E

25|$|It was {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by a}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> in the main spar of the left wing that caused the outer part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, to separate from the remainder of the aircraft.

40|$|<b>Fatigue</b> <b>{{cracking}}</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common distresses of asphalt pavements, whereas healing is a counter process to cracking which alleviates cracking damage and extends fatigue life of asphalt pavements. Most of existing methods to characterize <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> and healing are generally empirical or phenomenological in nature, which does not satisfy the need to develop mechanistic-based pavement design methods. The objective of this study is to characterize <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> and healing of asphalt mixtures using an energy-based mechanistic approach. A controlled-strain repeated direct tension (RDT) test is selected to generate both <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> and permanent deformation in an asphalt mixture specimen. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is separated from permanent deformation from a mechanical viewpoint. The development of <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> is described by the evolution of the damage density and the increase of the average crack size with the increase of loading cycles. A creep and step-loading recovery (CSR) test is designed to measure the internal stress in the recovery phase of an asphalt mixture specimen. The internal stress and the strain measured in the recovery phase are used to conduct the mechanistic analysis of recovery and healing of the asphalt mixture specimen. Then healing is described using the decrease of the damage density and average crack size with time. Different types of asphalt mixtures produce distinctly different <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> and healing characteristics. The effect of mixture composition, temperature, and aging are evaluated using the approach above. The entire series of tests for fatigue, permanent deformation and healing can be completed in one day, with the healing part requiring only a matter of minutes. The methods proposed in this study characterize <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> and healing of asphalt mixtures using its essential cause and effect relationship...|$|R

40|$|A new remote {{nondestructive}} inspection technique, based on thermoelastic temperature measurement by infrared thermography, is developed for detection {{and evaluation of}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> propagating from welded joints in steel bridges. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> are detected from localized high thermoelastic temperature change at crack tips due to stress singularity under variable loading from traffics on the bridge. Selfreference lock-in data processing technique is developed {{for the improvement of}} signal/noise ratio in the crack detection process. The technique makes it possible to perform correlation processing without an external reference signal. It is very difficult to detect through-deck type <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> in steel decks by the conventional NDT technique, since they are not open to the inspection. In this paper, self-reference lock-in thermography is applied for detection of through-deck type <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks.</b> Experiments are carried out to steel deck sample, which simulates an actual steel bridge, during crack propagation test.

500|$|Investigators {{discovered}} an impurity and <b>fatigue</b> <b>crack</b> in the disk.

To prevent this, the ingot that would become the fan disk was formed using a [...] "double vacuum" [...] process: the raw materials were melted together in a vacuum, allowed to cool and solidify, then melted in a vacuum once more. After the double vacuum process, the ingot was shaped into a billet, a sausage-like form about 16 inches in diameter, and tested using ultrasound to look for defects. Defects were located and the ingot was further processed to remove them, but some contamination remained. GE later added a third vacuum-forming stage because of their investigation into failing rotating titanium engine parts.|$|E

50|$|Edge {{cracking}} is {{the formation}} of crescent-shaped cracks {{near the edge of}} a road. It is caused by lack of support of the road edge, sometimes due to poorly drained or weak shoulders. If left untreated, additional cracks will form until it resembles <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking.</b> Like wheel-path <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking,</b> poor drainage is a main cause of edge cracking, as it weakens the base, which hastens the deterioration of the pavement. Water ponding (a buildup of water which can also be called puddling) happens more frequently near the edge than {{in the center of the}} road path, as roads are usually sloped to prevent in-lane ponding. This leads to excess moisture in the shoulders and subbase at the road edge. Edge <b>cracking</b> differs from <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracking</b> in that the cracks form from the top down, where <b>fatigue</b> <b>cracks</b> usually start at the bottom and propagate to the surface.|$|R
