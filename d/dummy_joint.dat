40|$|AbstractA helium inlet and <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> between {{conductors}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important elements of the winding pack of the ITER PF - 1 coil double pancakes. A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for fatigue tests and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the fatigue tests thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the fatigue tests the leak tightness of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A low ohm electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> sample was developed for fatigue tests at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> sample for fatigue tests is a symmetrical model of two <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. Fatigue tests of the full-scale <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> sample will be conducted in 2014. This paper represents the results of calculating the stress-strain state of the symmetrical model of the full-scale <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> sample for fatigue tests with the prescribed loading and strain, the work on designing the symmetrical model of the <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> sample for fatigue tests and the test facility for conducting fatigue tests at 77  K. Also the results of the leak tightness tests and thermo-cycling of the full-scale helium inlet and the results of it fatigue tests at 77  K, are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on joint movement and load transfer efficiency (LTE) was evaluated {{based on data}} collected from an instrumented runway at Denver International Airport (DIA). The measured pavement temperature data from DIA was compared with an existing heat transfer model, the Integrated Climatic Model. Good agreement was obtained between the measured and predicted temperature differential and the average pavement temperature for airport concrete pavements. Average pavement temperature significantly affected the dummy and doweled joint movement. Hinged joints were not affected by changes in the average pavement temperature. The doweled and <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> movements varied {{the most in the}} fall season. The doweled and <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> movements were also restricted during certain periods in the summer due to the joint completely closing. The average pavement temperature affected the LTE of dummy joints due to its affect on aggregate interlock. A new correlation was developed between LTE and average pavement temperature for dummy joints. The LTE of dummy joints was found to be less than 50 percent for 55 percent of the year. The LTE of doweled and hinged joints were not significantly affected by changes in average pavement temperature. Hinged joints at DIA were found to be the most effective in transfer load between adjacent slabs...|$|E
40|$|Two test {{sections}} {{were set up}} on federal motorways with concrete pavement, portions of which are subject to high traffic. Applying a thin asphalt layer 4 cm thick with a stress-absorbing membrane interlayer (SAMI) was to improve the existing condition and the long-time behaviour of the concrete lane. The concrete pavement was rated in the critical joint area by measuring the relative vertical joint movement and the subsidence of the dowelled transverse <b>dummy</b> <b>joint</b> edge. These measurements were repeated on the stone-filled mastic asphalt over an observation period. Due to differences in climate, traffic volume, carriageway condition and layer composition, pronounced cracking developed {{in one of the}} two sections (constructed in 1968 and widened in 1975). The other test section, 16 years old, is practically free of cracks. On the basis of low-temperature and tensile tests on specimens, the critical area in terms of crack formation was shown to be over the joints. The four SAMI layers used are on a par. Recommendations are provided for a limiting value of the permissible relative vertical joint movement of the old concrete pavement to be covered and for measures involving the end plates. (orig.)

30|$|Turning to the {{employment}} equation (Table  2), we can observe that {{an increase in}} the wage rate has a negatively significant effect on employment, while a larger capital stock increases employment. A higher producer price will also have a significant positive effect. These results are all in line with expectations. Increased openness has a negative impact on employment. As regards the effect on bargaining power, we can see that {{only a few of the}} country dummies are significant, while the <b>joint</b> <b>dummy</b> in the partial model is not statistically significant. Thus, as with wages, there is no clear evidence that foreign ownership affects unions’ bargaining power over employment.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the design of the Hybrid III <b>dummy's</b> hip <b>joint</b> can cause high spikes in the chest accelerations. These spikes are {{generated}} when the pelvis rotation is suddenly stopped by the bottoming out of the hip joint. This creates large lumbar shear and tension forces which act to resist forward movement of the dummy's chest. This problem has partly been resolved by the introduction of 'modified femurs'. However, even with modified femurs, high peaks have still been observed in chest accelerations of some front barrier crashes. In order to analyze the load path from upper legs to chest, dynamic experiments have been performed on the hip joint (with modified femurs and with standard femurs), on the isolated lumbar spine and on a partial dummy consisting of upper legs, torso, neck and head. These tests have been used to significantly improve an existing model of the dummy. In the hip joint, a considerable rate-dependency was found and the adjustment of hip friction was found to be an important factor. For different lumbar spines from the same manufacturer, major differences in response were found. These differences between dummy parts are a concern for reproducibility of full dummy tests. A sensitivity analysis showed that such dummy related factors lead to variations in the order of 2 - 8 % for peak chest acceleration and chest deflection, but lead to much larger variations in lumbar loads...|$|R
40|$|Capacity {{formulas}} and random-coding and sphere-packing exponents {{are derived}} for a generalized family of Gel’fand-Pinsker coding problems. These exponents yield asymptotic {{upper and lower}} bounds, respectively, on the achievable log probability of error. Information is to be reliably transmitted through a noisy channel with finite input and output alphabets and random state sequence. The channel is selected by an hypothetical adversary. Partial information about the state sequence is available to the encoder, adversary, and decoder. The design of the transmitter is subject to a cost constraint. Two families of channels are considered: 1) compound discrete memoryless channels (C-DMC), and 2) channels with arbitrary memory, subject to an additive cost constraint, or more generally to a hard constraint on the conditional type of the channel output given the input. Both problems are closely connected. In each case the randomcoding and sphere-packing exponents coincide at high rates, thereby determining the reliability function of the channel family. The random-coding exponent is achieved using a stacked binning scheme and a maximum penalized mutual information decoder. The sphere-packing exponent is obtained by defining a <b>dummy</b> sequence whose <b>joint</b> type with the state sequence and channel inpu...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} the "Industrial Cluster Project" in Japan {{initiated by the}} Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in 2001 in terms of industry-university partnership (IUP), using original questionnaire data of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In this paper, we use the number of patent applications as the measure of both {{the performance of the}} cluster project and the industry-university partnership. Specifically, we test the following hypotheses: 1) The SMEs that participate in the cluster project apply for more patents than those that do not. 2) The effect of participation in the cluster project on R&D productivity is enhanced by collaboration with national universities within the same cluster area. We collected the data of 229 R&D intensive SMEs with up to 300 employees through a survey conducted in 2005. We employ negative binomial regression to test how participation in the cluster project affects R&D productivity, controlling for firm characteristics such as the number of employees, R&D intensity, the number of IUP projects, the dummy variable for collaboration with national universities, the <b>dummy</b> variable for <b>joint</b> R&D, the <b>dummy</b> variable for collaboration within cluster regions, and industry dummies. Moreover, we estimate the treatment effect model and the instrumental variables (IV) regression, considering the possibility that participation in a cluster project is endogenous. We use firm age as an instrumental variable because the cluster project aims at attracting start-ups and young firms. The estimation results can be summarized as follows. First, participation in the cluster projects alone does not affect patent application. Rather, local firms collaborating with partners outside the cluster show higher R&D productivity in general. Second, the cluster participants apply for more patents when they collaborate with national universities in the same cluster region. Further results reveal that, in this case, the quality of applied patents measured by the average number of claims does not significantly decrease, which is not in line with the argument that cluster firms are subject to administrative pressures to show off the performance of the cluster projects...|$|R
