S. An objective {{of this paper is}} to single out the portion of deviations from covered interest parity that is caused by capital controls imposed by the Japanese authority. To that end, new measures of one-way arbitrage gain are defined taking into account transactions costs associatedwith the bid-ask spread of exchange rates and the transactions tax on repurchase agreements, <b>Gensaki,</b> in Japan. According to our measure, covered interest parity has been holding, as theory predicts, in the Euro market since 1977. The Euro-Yen market must have been thin to have caused violations toparity in 1975 and 1976. Capital controls imposed by the Japanese Government are detected by one-way arbitrage measures between <b>Gensaki</b> in Japan and Euro-Dollar deposits between 1975 and 1980. After a new law was enacted in December 1980 which lifted most capital controls, covered interest parity has been holding between <b>Gensaki</b> and dollar-denominated assets. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} the {{recently}} introduced Gaussian estimation methodology in {{the estimation of}} a range of one factor short-term interest rate models on Japanese Certificate of Deposit (CD) and <b>Gensaki</b> interest rates. For Japan, the relationship between the volatility of rates and the level of rates is smaller than that reported by Chan, Karolyi, Longstaff, and Sanders (CKLS) [J. Finance 47 (1992) 1209. ] for the US. We find, generally, that the CEV model performs well for these rates in terms of data fit...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether Japan's financial deregulation {{weakened the}} linkage between the Euroyen and <b>Gensaki</b> markets. It defines and analyzes the linkage of the two markets {{in terms of the}} persistence and predictability of yield spreads, as well as cross-market causality. By using Johansen tests and an error correction model, this paper shows first, cross-market causality before and after deregulation; and second, one common trend in interest rates, substantial Gensaki-Euroyen yield spreads, and a slower response of the one-month Gensaki-Euroyen yield spread to a shock after deregulation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} if Japanese yen denominated {{interest rate}} swap spreads price risks {{in addition to}} liquidity and default risk. These additional risks include: the time-varying correlation between interest rates of different types and maturities; business cycle risk; and market skewness risk. Our analysis, {{over a number of}} different maturities and sample periods, supports the existence of an additional risk premium. We also show that the time-varying correlation between short term market interest rates (e. g., TIBOR) and the longer term Government bond yield (e. g., <b>Gensaki)</b> is of particular importance. Japanese yen swap spreads are shown to contain both pro-cyclical and counter-cyclical elements of business cycle risk, positive risk premia for skewness risk and variable risk premia for correlation risk (between fixed and floating interest rates) ...|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the choice of {{exchange}} rate regimes from a theoretical perspective. A conclusion of this literature is that, ceteris paribus, interest rates should exhibit less volatility (and exchange rates more volatility) under a floating than under a fixed exchange rate regime. Equivalently, interest rates should be relatively easier (and exchange rates relatively harder) to predict (in the statistical sense) under a floating exchange rate. Further, the unexpected volatility in interest rates due to external impulses should be reduced, and that in exchange rates increased, relative to a fixed exchange rate regime. This study analyses the question of interest rate and exchange rate volatility before and after the floating of the Australian dollar in December 1983. The paper adopts an atheoretical methodology of vector autoregressions (VAR’s) to calculate the forecast-error variance for interest rates and exchange rates (at different horizons) and to decompose these forecast-error variances into those parts attributable to domestic and external sources. A VAR model is estimated for both the pre- and post-float periods, on daily data for the Australian trade-weighted index, the Australian 90 day bank accepted bill rate, the US trade-weighted index, the US 90 day prime bankers’ acceptances rate, the DM trade-weighted index, the West German 90 day interbank deposits rate, the Japanese trade-weighted index and the Japanese 90 day <b>Gensaki</b> rate. This is the minimum configuration that can capture both domestic and foreign sources of volatility in financial prices. The analysis supports the hypothesis that interest rates have become relatively less volatile (and the exchange rate relatively more volatile) with the move to a floating exchange rate regime. However, the evidence suggests that this has been due to a change in the nature of the relationship between the Autralian interest rate and exchange rate; rather than a shift in the incidence of external shocks. This supports the notion that a more independent monetary policy is possible under a floating exchange rate regime. ...|$|E
