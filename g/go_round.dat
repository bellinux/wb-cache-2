5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead <b>go</b> <b>round</b> it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E

5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop {{down onto the}} sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of the}} sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to <b>go</b> <b>round</b> via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E

25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who {{you were going to get}} married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to <b>go</b> <b>round</b> the houses selling fabrics.|$|E

25|$|In South India, both sculpted {{and live}} snakes are worshipped. Every village has a serpent deity. It is worshipped {{as a single}} snake or nine snakes called Nava Naga but the popular form is of two snakes {{in the form of}} an “Eaculapian rod”. Every worshipper in South India worships the anthill where the snakes are {{reported}} to reside. Women decorate the anthill with turmeric paste and vermillion and sugar mixed with wheat flour. They bedeck it with flowers with the help of threads tied to wooden frames. In Maharashtra, they <b>go</b> <b>round</b> the anthill in a worship mode five times singing songs in praise of snake gods.|$|E

The defenders were overrun after a mutually costly engagement, the intermediate objective at a line of pillboxes in the sunken road inside the wood was captured. After a pause, the support battalions leapfrogged the leading battalions and pressed on against greater opposition and delays caused by machine-guns sited in old artillery positions and boggy ground. The troops lost the barrage but a few parties reached the final objective, the Wilhelmstellung pillboxes in Polygon Wood and northwards along Anzac Farm spur to the vicinity of Iron Cross Redoubt.|$|E
25|$|One {{particular}} historic {{attempt to}} round the Horn, that of HMS Bounty in 1788, has been immortalized in history {{due to the}} subsequent Mutiny on the Bounty. This abortive Horn voyage has been portrayed (with varying historical accuracy) in three major motion pictures about Captain William Bligh's mission to transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica. The Bounty made only 85 miles of headway in 31 days of east-to-west sailing, before giving up by reversing course and going around Africa. Although the 1984 movie portrayed another decision to <b>go</b> <b>round</b> the Horn as a precipitating factor in the mutiny (this time west-to-east after collecting the breadfruits in the South Pacific), in fact that was never contemplated {{out of concern for}} the effect of the low temperatures near the Horn on the plants.|$|E
