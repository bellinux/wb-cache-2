500|$|The {{portrait}} is {{not particularly}} well preserved. There are yellowish layers of <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> the face, probably later additions. The varnishes have degraded and lost their original colours. The panel has undergone a number of detrimental retouchings. In some instances, these have altered the sitter's appearance, most especially the removal of strands of fair hair below the chaperon. It has sustained structural damage, especially to the marble on the reverse. The National Gallery repaired some [...] "slight injuries" [...] when it came into their possession in 1857. Campbell notes a number of efforts by later restorers were imperfect and [...] "rather disfiguring", including touchings to the man's nostrils and eyelashes, and {{the tip of his}} nose. There is a yellowish <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> the eyes that seems to be either damage or overpaint. The panel is discoloured overall and suffers from aged and degenerated varnishes that make the original pigments hard to discern.|$|E
500|$|Pierce {{returned}} to the horror genre with the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on {{the true story of}} the Phantom Killer, an unidentified serial killer who murdered five people in Texarkana in 1946. Pierce remembered being scared by news stories about the killer during his youth in Hampton. He received some criticism for the graphic violence portrayed in the film, particularly one scene where the killer ties a woman to a tree, attaches a knife {{to the end of a}} trombone, then repeatedly stabs her while playing the instrument. Pierce said he purposely made the film violent because he felt the real-life situation was horrific and did not want to <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> it. While filming horror scenes, he tried to create a suspenseful mood by clearing the set of only the essential cast and staff, then refusing to let them talk to each other as the scenes were shot. Pierce appeared in The Town That Dreaded Sundown as police Patrolman A.C. [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Benson, an idiotic comic relief character. The name [...] "Spark Plug" [...] was a real-life nickname given to the director due to his energy. Pierce described The Town That Dread Sundown as a very easy and enjoyable shoot with no major problems on the set.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clive laughed. [...] "Rosey {{is as good}} {{a little}} {{creature}} as can be," [...] he said. [...] "She is never out of temper, though I fancy Mrs. Mackenzie tries her. I don't think she is very wise: but she is uncommonly pretty, and her beauty grows on you. As for Ethel, anything so high and mighty I have never seen since I saw the French giantess. Going to Court, and about to parties every night where a parcel of young fools flatter her, has perfectly spoiled her. By Jove, how handsome she is! How she turns with her long neck, and looks at you from under those black eyebrows! If I painted her hair, I think I should paint it almost blue, and then <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> with lake. It is blue. And how finely her head is joined on to her shoulders!"--And he waves in the air an imaginary line with his cigar. [...] "She would do for Judith, wouldn't she? Or how grand she would look as Herodias's daughter sweeping down a stair--in a great dress of cloth-of-gold like Paul Veronese--holding a charger before her with white arms, you know--with the muscles accented like that glorious Diana at Paris--a savage smile on her face and a ghastly solemn gory head on the dish. I see the picture, sir, I see the picture!" [...] and he fell to curling his mustachios just like his brave old father.|$|E

60|$|There are {{two classes}} of men called poets. The one cultivates life, the other art,--one seeks food for nutriment, the other for flavor; one {{satisfies}} hunger, the other gratifies the palate. There {{are two kinds of}} writing, both great and rare; one that of genius, or the inspired, the other of intellect and taste, in the intervals of inspiration. The former is above criticism, always correct, giving the law to criticism. It vibrates and pulsates with life forever. It is sacred, and to be read with reverence, as the works of nature are studied. There are few instances of a sustained style of this kind; perhaps every man has spoken words, but the speaker is then careless of the record. Such a style removes us out of personal relations with its author; we do not take his words on our lips, but his sense into our hearts. It is the stream of inspiration, which bubbles out, now here, now there, now in this man, now in that. It matters not through what ice-crystals it is seen, now a fountain, now the ocean stream running under ground. It is in Shakespeare, Alpheus, in Burns, Arethuse; but ever the same. The other is self-possessed and wise. It is reverent of genius, and greedy of inspiration. It is conscious in the highest and the least degree. It consists with the most perfect command of the faculties. It dwells in a repose as of the desert, and objects are as distinct in it as oases or palms in the horizon of sand. The train of thought moves with subdued and measured step, like a caravan. But the pen is only an instrument in its hand, and not instinct with life, like a longer arm. It leaves a thin varnish or <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> all its work. The works of Goethe furnish remarkable instances of the latter.|$|E
50|$|Creamware is a cream-coloured, refined {{earthenware}} with a lead <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> a pale body. It {{was created}} around 1740 by the potters of Staffordshire, England, {{and became a}} popular domestic ware until the 1840s.|$|E
5000|$|Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph is a 1656 oil {{painting}} by Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn. It {{is said to}} have almost “a sculptural surface with a translucent <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> paint”. [...] This piece is housed in the Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel in Kassel, Germany.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{prior to}} an attack, their eyes can <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> and go hard, {{followed}} by the dog snapping into alert mode before finally attacking.

50|$|In general, {{works of}} art on paper should be stored in a cool and {{relatively}} dry room with minimal exposure to light. Pastel artworks should be matted and framed. Framing should be under ultraviolet filtering acrylic sheeting. Using a <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> {{the surface of the}} oil pastel works can help to protect the oil pastel from damage. Limited exhibition time and low light intensity is recommended to limit light exposure. Excessive light exposure can cause pigment fading and discoloration in the paper.|$|E
60|$|Fay's long lashes fluttered; {{her eyes}} opened. At first they seemed <b>glazed</b> <b>over.</b> They looked dazed by pain. Then they quickened, darkened, to shine with intelligence--bewilderment--memory--and sudden {{wonderful}} joy.|$|R

50|$|After {{the most}} recent {{restoration}} of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl's gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced. During the restoration, {{it was discovered that}} the dark background, today somewhat mottled, was initially intended by the painter to be a deep enamel-like green. This effect was produced by applying a thin transparent layer of paint, called a <b>glaze,</b> <b>over</b> the present-day black background. However, the two organic pigments of the green glaze, indigo and weld, have faded.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, silver was rare and was {{imported}} from Asia. Therefore, it was silver that was often considered more precious than gold. The eastern desert {{was also an}} important source for colorful semi-precious stones such as carnelian, amethyst and jasper. In the Sinai were turquoise mines, the deep blue lapis lazuli had to come from far away Afghanistan. Glass and faience (<b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> a core of stone or sand) were favorites to replace rocks because they could be produced in many colors.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Smith {{developed}} an “antique" [...] style of painting. Utilizing oil <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> gessoed hard board, he scratched and scraped {{the surface of}} wet paint to create highlights. Still lifes featured antique props set up in his studio. Landscapes depicted simple farmhouses and cottages in rural Cape Cod. Smith limited his palette to basic earth tones, avoiding overuse of white, with dashes of red or viridian applied sparingly. Smith completed the antique feel of his paintings by setting them in distressed frames.|$|E
50|$|In 1993-96, the {{buildings}} were extensively modernised. The original courtyard was <b>glazed</b> <b>over</b> and an extension {{was added to the}} Aytoun Street side of the courts. The architect for these works was James Stevenson of the Hurd Rolland Partnership.|$|R

50|$|In this painting, {{concepts}} of conventional composition are rejected. The {{figures of the}} individuals represented are not clearly defined but modeled with brushstrokes. The colors are placed directly on the canvas with loose, repetitive strokes instead of applying layers of pigments and <b>glazes</b> <b>over</b> a dark background.|$|R
50|$|Ragging {{can be done}} as a {{negative}} or positive technique. The former involves rolling <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> the entire surface, and removing it with clean rags to reveal the underlying paint color in a pleasing textural pattern. The latter is accomplished by applying glaze directly to the wall with a rag, and creates a similar pattern. Ragging is a very adaptable finish {{that can be used}} in a variety of areas, creating the illusion of an old world texture, but on a flat surface that can be easily painted over.|$|E
5000|$|Orlando {{is often}} {{considered}} a feminist film; however, Potter denies that label. She {{said in an}} interview,"I {{have come to the}} conclusion that I can't use that term in my work. Not because of a disavowal of the underlying principles that gave birth to that word - the commitment to liberation, dignity, equality. But it has become a trigger word that stops people's thinking. You literally see people's eyes <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> with exhaustion when the word flashes into the conversation." [...] Potter claims that the story shows the difficulties both of being a man and of a being a woman.|$|E
5000|$|Underlining {{this change}} in {{character}} and the choosing of the new moniker, Tillman admits the following in an interview for the Dallas Observer: [...] "I used to do these J. Tillman shows and I would play my sad-wizard, Dungeons and Dragons music and watch people's eyes <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> ... Then, in between songs, I would start being myself and shooting the shit and telling jokes. ... All of a sudden, people were rapt with attention and I had this very devastating and sobering realization that I was way better at {{that part of the}} show than the music part." ...|$|E
50|$|Red lac, {{also called}} red lake, crimson lake or carmine lake, was an {{important}} red pigment in Renaissance and Baroque art. Since it was translucent, thin layers of red lac were built up or <b>glazed</b> <b>over</b> a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color.|$|R

50|$|Anna finds and {{interrupts}} {{an assembly}} gathered to watch Lucie die on a cross. Lucie gets {{a look in}} her eyes that the group feels signifies martyrdom and Anna, wielding Fenton's gun, insists that Lucie be freed. Lucie reveals what she saw in a whisper to Anna. Eleanor demands to know what Lucie said; the priest says he heard Lucie's whispers before quickly putting a gun in his mouth and killing himself. Anna shoots Eleanor {{and the rest of the}} cabal members flee. Anna embraces Lucie as they lie dying on the floor. With the police on their way, both women's eyes <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> with the look of martyrdom.|$|E
50|$|Stoneware can be once-fired or twice-fired. Maximum firing {{temperatures}} {{can vary}} significantly, from 1100 °C to 1300 °C {{depending on the}} flux content. Typically, temperatures will be between 1180 °C to 1280 °C, the higher end of which equate to Bullers Rings 38 to 40 or Seger cones 4 to 8. To produce a better quality fired glaze finish, twice-firing can be used. This can be especially important for formulations composed of highly carbonaceous clays. For these, biscuit firing is around 900 °C, and glost firing (the firing used to form the <b>glaze</b> <b>over</b> the ware) 1180 - 1280 °C. Water absorption of stoneware products is less than 1 percent.|$|E
5000|$|The Sarabandes {{also offer}} {{the first example}} of Satie the musical [...] "prankster" [...] with their odd enharmonic notation, which can cause needless {{difficulties}} for the performer. Joseph Smith observed, [...] "Pianistically, anyone who can play the Gymnopédies can play the Sarabandes; however, the modal Gymnopédies are easy to read, whereas the Sarabandes, with their unsightly globs of flats and double-flats, can cause {{the eyes of the}} most facile reader to cross and <b>glaze</b> <b>over.</b> Some believe that this discouraging note-spelling is Satie's way of teasing the player, and certainly it would be consistent with Satiean humor, which can be interpreted as self-deprecating, disarming - or hostile." ...|$|E
5000|$|Huggins' horses, cattle, {{and poultry}} {{pictures}} were his {{best and most}} characteristic work, good in drawing, and remarkable for brilliance of colour. [...] "Tried Friends", purchased by the Liverpool corporation, illustrates his use of transparent <b>glazes</b> <b>over</b> a white ground. Huggins' preferred medium was painting on white millboard from pencil outlines.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} of the {{building}} is divided into rooms off a central hall by three quarter height tongue and groove panelled partitions with <b>glazing</b> <b>over.</b> The ceiling is tongue and groove similar to the ground floor.

50|$|William Bell Scott {{recognised}} {{the early}} Pre-Raphaelite precision in Blacklock's technique and his great power of truth; {{indeed it was}} Scott and his artistic friends (almost certainly including Rossetti), who used Blacklock's painting Barnard Castle of 1852-53 to try to study his luminous <b>glazes</b> <b>over</b> a white ground which had been developed over many years.|$|R
