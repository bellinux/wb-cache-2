5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has a}} warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a <b>glissando.</b> Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations {{of the two}} martins {{are quite}} different. Mascarene martin has a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a <b>glissando.</b> Other vocalisations may be used during mating or {{displays}} of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent. The song of Brazza's martin consists {{of a series of}} short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks. The song becomes increasingly loud, although the final clicks are quite soft. The song {{is similar to that of}} the banded martin, and does not resemble that of the Mascarene martin, suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems.|$|E
25|$|The {{trombone}} {{is one of}} the few wind {{instruments that}} can produce a true <b>glissando,</b> by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a <b>glissando</b> must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a <b>glissando.</b> 'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked <b>glissando</b> effect.|$|E

50|$|The second {{movement}} {{is the most}} recognizable piece of the score: directly after the first movement's fermata, a lone first violin launches directly {{into a series of}} discordant, screechy <b>glissandos</b> before being joined {{by the rest of the}} string section. This pattern is repeated twice, albeit the second set of <b>glissandos</b> is notated somewhat differently. The movements ends with another fermata.|$|R

25|$|Portamento {{effects can}} be {{achieved}} by changing the pitch while it can still be heard. This is commonly called a <b>glissando,</b> though this use of the term is not strictly correct. The most effective glissandos are those from low to high notes and those performed during rolls. One of the first composers to call for a timpani <b>glissando</b> was Carl Nielsen, who used two sets of timpani playing glissandos {{at the same time in}} his Symphony No. 4 ("The Inextinguishable").|$|E
25|$|The banjo {{is usually}} tuned with {{friction}} tuning pegs or planetary gear tuners, {{rather than the}} worm gear machine head used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute <b>glissando,</b> play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.|$|E
25|$|The moose call or <b>glissando</b> {{is done by}} {{rubbing the}} third finger, {{supported}} by the thumb, across {{the head of the}} drum. The finger is sometimes moistened with saliva or sweat, and sometimes a little coat of beeswax is put {{on the surface of the}} conga head to help make the sound. The moose call is also done on the bongos.|$|E
5000|$|The main dreydlekh are glitshn (<b>glissandos),</b> krekhtsn ("sobs", [...] "wails"), kneytshn ("wrinkles"), tshoks (a kind of bent {{notes of}} cackle-like sound), and flageolets (harmonics).|$|R
50|$|Another {{series of}} <b>glissandos</b> in the treble voice ushers {{in a brief}} cadenza. This foreshadows another {{arpeggio}} which brings the two movements to a percussive conclusion.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Weeping is {{a general}} lament over Lucifer's {{decision}} to reject Eve's first-born, and is realised {{by a series of}} <b>glissandos</b> in the synthesizers and choir, which imitate sobbing and weeping [...]|$|R
25|$|Since its {{inception}} in 2007, the ACJC Guitar Ensemble (ACGE) has obtained one gold with honours in 2007, one gold award in 2009 at the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging for Instrument Ensembles and a Certificate of Distinction in 2013, under the revised awards scheme for the Singapore Youth Festival Art Presentations. They organise two annual concerts - <b>Glissando</b> in May and A Christmas Story in December, {{to raise funds for}} their adopted charity, Club Rainbow. The ensemble is conducted by Mr. Terence Choo.|$|E
25|$|The music {{score was}} {{composed}} by Bernard Herrmann in August 1951, and {{was his first}} score after he moved from New York to Hollywood. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, a large studio electric organ, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, marimba, tam-tam, two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas. Herrmann's notable advances in film scoring included Unison organs, tubas, piano, and bass drum, staggered tritone movement, and <b>glissando</b> in theremins, as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E-flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques. By using the theremin Herrmann made one of music's first forays into electronic music, one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Var√®se, something that was overlooked by the classical elite.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{the score}} does allow the {{interpreter}} {{to make choices}} on how to perform a historical work. For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), {{it is not known}} exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part (only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or <b>glissando</b> (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{music is}} highly diversified, and {{therefore}} requires various systems of notation. In Japanese shakuhachi music, for example, <b>glissandos</b> and timbres {{are often more}} significant than distinct pitches, whereas taiko notation focuses on discrete strokes.|$|R
50|$|Walter Booker (December 17, 1933 - November 24, 2006) was an American jazz musician. A {{native of}} Prairie View, Texas, Booker was a {{reliable}} bass player and an underrated stylist. His playing {{was marked by}} voice-like inflections, <b>glissandos</b> and tremolo techniques.|$|R
50|$|Stokowski's {{heritage}} as an organist is very {{apparent in}} this section, with brass choirs piled {{on top of}} one another in gigantic chords. The section contains a number of spooky effects, such as the violins' <b>glissandos</b> and the presence of bass drum and gong.|$|R
500|$|The song {{is played}} at a tempo of 130 {{beats per minute}} in a 4/4 time signature, but only one element of the song's [...] introduction, a marimba-like texture, is played in common time. This sound, which has been {{compared}} to that of a clock ticking, was achieved by picking the guitar's D string behind the bridge and the stopbar. On {{the second half of the}} third beat, the song's signature guitar riff, a distorted descending <b>glissando,</b> enters. The <b>glissando</b> descends past the octave it begins in by a major second before returning to it. After the second time it is played, an [...] "explosion" [...] of percussion is heard, playing on beat four of every second measure on two occasions. This percussion sound, played by Flood, enters early the third time, being played on beat two. The drums then enter, before stopping and starting again. Much like the song's guitar sounds, the drums' timbre is noticeably different from previous U2 songs as it exhibits a [...] "cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can". Amidst layers of various guitar sounds, the bass enters, the part played in the introduction and verses consisting of repeating G and A notes, mimicking the ascending portion of the guitar riff after the <b>glissando</b> overshoots the octave. After the bass begins, the song's regular groove is established. At 0:45, the chord progression changes. Fifteen seconds later, the song returns to the previous chord progression and the introduction ends.|$|E
500|$|... "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" [...] is a {{modified}} {{repeat of the}} opening song at a faster tempo with heavier instrumentation. The track opens with McCartney's count-in (retained {{in the manner of}} [...] "I Saw Her Standing There", the opening song on the Beatles' first album); between 2 and 3, Lennon jokingly interjects [...] "Bye!" [...] Ringo Starr starts the song proper by playing the drum part unaccompanied for four bars, {{at the end of which}} a brief bass <b>glissando</b> from McCartney cues the full ensemble of two distorted electric guitars (played by George Harrison and Lennon), bass, drums and overdubbed percussion. In addition, McCartney overdubbed a Hammond organ part onto the track.|$|E
500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] {{is a song}} by Irish {{rock band}} U2. It is the opening track from their 1991 album Achtung Baby, [...] a record on which the group reinvented {{themselves}} musically by incorporating influences from alternative rock, industrial, and electronic dance music. As the album's opening track, [...] "Zoo Station" [...] introduces the band's new sound, delivering industrial-influenced percussion and several layers of distorted guitars and vocals. Similarly, the lyrics suggest the group's new intents and anticipations. The introduction, featuring an [...] "explosion" [...] of percussion and a descending <b>glissando</b> for a guitar hook, was meant to make the listener think the album was mistakenly not U2's latest record or that their music player was broken.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the only}} of Stokowski's {{movements}} that owes much to Ravel. However, it does have some colors of its own: A flute alternates with the muted trumpet in the poor man's plea, {{and the return of}} the pompous [...] "rich man" [...] theme uses ominous trombone <b>glissandos</b> to great effect.|$|R
50|$|The second movement, which {{treats the}} evening before the sacrifice, is {{conceived}} purely instrumentally; this movement is clearly closer to the style of his contemporaries. However, from this movement on, Xenakis {{would no longer be}} constrained by serial techniques, and would explore his musical viewpoints and perspectives by using <b>glissandos</b> and discontinuous pitches.|$|R
25|$|Cor Fuhler (1964) is a Dutch/Australian improvising musician, {{composer}} and instrument builder, {{known for his}} pioneering extended piano techniques. He created the keyolin in the 1990s. The keyolin is a 2-string violin played via a mechanical keyboard, which controls pitch, vibrato, <b>glissandos</b> and partials. A customised bow, played upside down, controls timbre and volume.|$|R
500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the <b>glissando</b> evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{describes}} the song as [...] "Stylistically ‚Ä¶ {{the most distant}} departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography". The basic track was recorded on 15 March 1967 at EMI's Abbey Road studio 2 in London. The participants sat on a carpet in the studio, which was decorated with Indian tapestries on the walls, with the lights turned low and incense burning. Harrison and Aspinall each played a tambura, while the Indian musicians contributed on tabla, dilruba, tambura and swarmandal. A type of zither, the swarmandal provided the <b>glissando</b> flourishes that introduce the tabla during the alap and signal the return to 16-beat tintal before the final verse. Musicologist Michael Hannan comments that, relative to standard Indian practice, the use of three tamburas produces [...] "a denser-than-usual, pulsating jivari" [...] (or [...] "buzzing sound"), highlighting the naturally rich harmonics of the instrument.|$|E
500|$|After the introduction, {{the song}} follows a {{conventional}} verse-chorus form. The first verse begins one minute into the song, with Bono announcing, [...] "I'm ready, I'm {{ready for the}} laughing gas". During the verses, he sings primarily in a medium-to-low range and his vocals are treated with heavy processing, which takes out {{the bottom of the}} sound and [...] "emasculate" [...] his voice. The processing also introduces a wavering quality to his vocals. The guitar <b>glissando</b> continues to be played during the verses. The first chorus begins at 1:44, and the music mirrors the change in chord progression from the introduction's last 15 seconds. During the chorus, the bassline becomes more dynamic, playing descending quarter notes of G‚ÄìF‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìD‚ÄìC‚ÄìA‚ÄìG‚ÄìA, before resuming the previous G and A pattern. Bono's vocals also become more dynamic in the chorus, featuring layers of both [...] "open-throated" [...] singing and monotone lyric recitation, as well as both processed and unprocessed vocals.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s he {{recorded}} in orchestras with Stravinsky. It {{has been suggested}} that he was the soloist in Stravinsky's own 1928 Paris recording of Pulcinella where the trombonist omits the written <b>glissandos</b> - instead playing the notes staccato. The Octet for winds recorded in the same period features trombonists Andr√© Lafosse and Rapha√´l Delbos.|$|R
50|$|The {{compositional}} {{style is}} primarily polytonal and polyrhythmic, with elements of minimalism and atonality. Woodwinds are used throughout to introduce Gaelic folk melodies, with violin often being {{employed as a}} fiddle, either solo or in duet. The three acts vary stylistically, although some musical gestures are common to all three, such as long rising <b>glissandos</b> in the string section.|$|R
5000|$|The Deep Note is THX's audio trademark, being a {{distinctive}} synthesized crescendo that <b>glissandos</b> {{from a low}} rumble to a high pitch. It was created by Dr. James A. Moorer, a former employee of Lucasfilm's Computer Division in late 1982. The sound is used on trailers for THX-certified movie theaters, home video, video games, and car infotainment systems.|$|R
500|$|Percussive {{effects in}} {{imitation}} of drumming had been introduced to bowed-string instruments by early in the 17th century. The earliest known use of col legno (tapping on the strings {{with the back of}} the bow) is found in Tobias Hume's First Part of Ayres for unaccompanied viola da gamba (1605), in a piece titled Harke, Harke. Carlo Farina, an Italian violinist active in Germany, also used col legno to mimic the sound of a drum in his Capriccio stravagante for four stringed instruments (1627), where he also used devices such as <b>glissando,</b> tremolo, pizzicato, and sul ponticello to imitate the noises of barnyard animals (cat, dog, chicken). Later in the century, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber, in certain movements of Battalia (1673), added to these effects the device of placing a sheet of paper under the A string of the double bass, in order to imitate the dry rattle of a snare drum, and in [...] "Die liederliche Gesellschaft von allerley Humor" [...] from the same programmatic battle piece, superimposed eight different melodies in different keys, producing in places dense orchestral clusters. He also uses the percussive snap of fortissimo pizzicato to represent gunshots.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1921, with {{an article}} {{serialized}} in The Freeman, an Irish cultural journal, Cowell popularized the term tone cluster. While {{he did not}} coin the phrase, as is often claimed, {{he appears to have}} been the first to use it with its current meaning. During the 1920s and 1930s, Cowell toured widely through North America and Europe, playing his own experimental works, many built around tone clusters. In addition to The Tides of Manaunaun, Dynamic Motion, and its five [...] "encores"‚ÄîWhat's This (1917), Amiable Conversation (1917), Advertisement (1917), Antinomy (1917, rev. 1959; frequently misspelled [...] "Antimony"), and Time Table (1917)‚Äîthese include The Voice of Lir (1920), Exultation (1921), The Harp of Life (1924), Snows of Fujiyama (1924), Lilt of the Reel (1930), and Deep Color (1938). Tiger (1930) has a chord of 53 notes, probably the largest ever written for a single instrument until 1969. Along with Ives, Cowell wrote some of the first large-ensemble pieces to make extensive use of clusters. The Birth of Motion ( [...] 1920), his earliest such effort, combines orchestral clusters with <b>glissando.</b> [...] "Tone Cluster," [...] the second movement of Cowell's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928, prem. 1978), employs a wide variety of clusters for the piano and each instrumental group (...) [...] From a quarter-century later, his Symphony No. 11 (1953) features a sliding chromatic cluster played by muted violins.|$|E
2500|$|The {{left hand}} {{techniques}} {{are important for}} the expressiveness of pipa music. [...] Left-hand techniques that produce vibrato, portamento, <b>glissando,</b> pizzicato, harmonics or artificial harmonics found in violin or guitar are also found in pipa. String-bending for example {{may be used to}} produce a <b>glissando</b> or portamento. [...] Note however that the frets on all Chinese lutes are high so that the fingers and strings never touch the fingerboard in between the frets, this is different from many Western fretted instruments and allows for dramatic vibrato and other pitch changing effects.|$|E
5000|$|The aural {{character}} of the tenth Klavierst√ºck {{is dominated by the}} use of tone clusters, which occur in a variety of sizes as well as in cluster <b>glissandos,</b> which are {{the most important aspect of}} the work's unique aural flavour. The performance of them requires the performer to wear gloves with the fingers cut away [...]|$|R
5000|$|Wu's {{recording}} of Brahms's Variations on a Theme of Paganini, Books I and II received praise from Musical America's Harris Goldsmith, who wrote, [...] "Her {{account of the}} Brahms is amazing. She takes all the difficult options (her <b>glissandos</b> are unbelievable!), and she conjures from the piano absolutely gossamer, violinistic textures, joyous humor, and brilliant air-borne tempos".|$|R
5000|$|The {{formula of}} Jubil√§um {{is in the}} guise of a chorale with a melody {{containing}} 15 pitches grouped into five segments of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 tones: (C) + (F F) + (G D A) + (C B A E) + (G E B D G).The five segments have durations of 2, 3 (1 + 2), 6 (3 + 1 + 2), 10 (2 + 4 +1 + 3), and 15 (4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5) crotchets, and each is followed by a [...] "coloured silence" [...] of 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 crotchets. These colourations are made in the lower instruments (horns, violas, cellos) by overtone <b>glissandos,</b> in the middle register by natural-harmonic <b>glissandos</b> in the violins, and in the highest register by arpeggios on five triangles and a set of glass chimes [...]|$|R
