5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} from {{isolated}} teeth and fragmentary lower jaws. The jaw <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> under the last premolars, but becomes shallower towards the front. The lower premolars are elongate. The lower molars are shorter and broader {{than those of}} Sivaladapis. Indraloris may have been arboreal and at least partly frugivorous. When the first Indraloris fossils were discovered in the early 1930s, one was misidentified as a carnivoran and the other as a loris. The carnivoran identification was corrected in 1968, and in 1979 Indraloris and the related Sivaladapis were identified as late survivors of Adapiformes, an archaic primate group.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The shell suture <b>is</b> <b>deep.</b> The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3Â¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the shell length, and the aperture is very oblique. The shell color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in shell length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{zygomatic}} {{plates are}} almost completely vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward and the zygomatic plates are bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch, <b>is</b> <b>deep,</b> not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> orange-yellow with blackish markings. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> orange-yellow with waved blackish lines.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{underground}} stations on the line <b>are</b> significantly <b>deeper</b> than the others. Tsim Sha Tsui and Admiralty stations <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> because they precede harbour crossings. Admiralty and Central <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> they provide cross-platform interchange with the deep-level Island Line.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 12 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> olive-buff with a broad band of pale olive-buff. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> olive-buff.|$|R
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both {{the right and left}} sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of the}} fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E
50|$|The {{forewings}} <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> {{black and}} the hindwings <b>are</b> rich glossy <b>deep</b> blue, brightest near the base. The fringe is carmine-red. The head, antennae, legs and thorax <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> {{black and the}} abdomen bright glossy blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 8 mm for males and 8.5 mm for females. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> olive-buff with black reticulations. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> olive.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> purplish brown. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> smoky {{with a faint}} purplish tinge. Adults have been recorded on wing from February to July.|$|R
5|$|The three {{subspecies}} {{also differ}} in their colour. A. m. angolensis has a brown to tawny coat, with thick, dark brown stripes on the face extending two-thirds down to the snout. While the lateral stripe is nearly black, the stripe on the rump is dark brown. The medium brown forehead patch extends to eye level and is separated from the bright white face by a dark brown border. A brown spot is seen on the nose. A. m. hofmeyri is a light fawn, with thin, dark brown face stripes. The stripes on the flanks are dark brown to black, and the posterior stripes are moderately brown. The forehead patch, dark brown or fawn, extends beyond {{the level of the}} eyes and mixes with the white of the face without any clear barriers. The nose may have a pale smudge. A. m. marsupialis is a rich chestnut brown, with thin, light face stripes. The stripe near the rump is well-marked, and that on the flanks <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> brown. The forehead is brown, fawn, or white, the patch not extending beyond the eyes and having no sharp boundaries. The nose is white or marked with brown.|$|E
5|$|With a stocky, {{powerful}} build, the Exmoor pony {{is strong}} for its height, and {{noted for its}} hardiness and endurance. The chest <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> and the back broad, the croup level. The legs are short, with good bone and hard hooves. Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds, which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar, this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study. The study, when properly translated, refers to a feature, found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws, {{that appears to be}} an extra branch of blood supply in the area. While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply, its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} livery for locomotives on the Talyllyn <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> bronze green, lined {{in black}} and yellow, although since the 1980s {{there has been a}} policy of varying some of the liveries for a period of time.|$|E

25|$|The chest <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> {{and broad}} with a {{slightly}} protruding breastbone, with well-sprung ribs. The depth of the chest is approximately one-half {{the height of the}} dog at the withers, and the deepest point of the chest should lie between the elbows, not above them.|$|E
25|$|Gray's posthumously-published Watergate book {{disputes}} {{the claim that}} Mark Felt <b>is</b> <b>Deep</b> Throat, citing Woodward's own notes and other evidence as proof that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only {{one of whom was}} Felt.|$|E
25|$|The {{title role}} is {{undoubtedly}} {{the main focus}} of the ballet. She is a gentle water sprite who the audience discovers dancing in a waterfall and then with her own shadow. Her love for Palemon <b>is</b> <b>deep,</b> which is what makes his unfaithfulness so devastating and dramatic.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm {{for males and}} 26 mm for females. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with several buffy-olive lines from the costa to the dorsum. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> colonial buff with a buffy-olive patch.|$|R

25|$|The Chamber of Secrets, which <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> {{under the}} school (most likely under the lake), {{was home to}} an ancient Basilisk, {{intended}} {{to be used to}} purge the school of Muggle-born students. Salazar Slytherin, {{one of the founders of}} Hogwarts, built the Chamber before he left the school.|$|E
25|$|The body is elongated, {{slightly}} compressed, {{and almost}} completely covered by scales. The head lacks scales and is wider than it <b>is</b> <b>deep,</b> {{with a small}} terminal mouth and a projecting lower jaw. The maxilla does not extend below the anterior margin of the eye. The teeth are conical and are present in double rows on both jaws. The eyes are directed slightly upwards and sideways.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximal}} {{surface of}} the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating with the radius. The lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic facet for articulation with the scaphoid. The medial surface possesses a smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral. The palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface is broad and rounded. The distal {{surface of the}} bone <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> and concave.|$|E

25|$|The grave to {{the east}} of Turkman Gate is not the {{mausoleum}} of the 13th century Sufi Shams-ul-Arifeen Shah Turkman Byabani. The Shrine of the Sufi <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> inside Mohalla Qabristan and can be approached either through Mohammad Deen Ilaichi Marg or through the road leading to Chitli Qabar from Turkman Gate. The grave {{to the east}} of Turkman Gate {{has nothing to do with}} the Sufi and this is some imposter who is using lak of information on the Sufi Sanit to make some quick buck.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals has been over the HahaâHung pair. The most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is {{in the names of}} the letters: The unvoiced letter Haha <b>is</b> <b>deep,</b> while the voiced Hung, which suggests a lower position, is tall. This is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the Shavian edition of Androcles and the Lion. This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.|$|E
25|$|According to veteran German author, {{journalist}} and Russia-correspondent Gabriele Krone-Schmalz, there <b>is</b> <b>deep</b> disapproval of everything Russian in Estonia. A poll conducted by Gallup International suggested that 34% Estonians {{have a positive}} attitude towards Russia, but it is supposed that survey results were likely impacted by a large ethnic Russian minority in country. In a 2012 poll, 3% of the Russian minority in Estonia {{reported that they had}} experienced a racially motivated hate crime (as compared to an average of 10% among ethnic minorities and immigrants in EU).|$|E
