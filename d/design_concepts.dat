5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most important in this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior <b>design</b> <b>concepts.</b>|$|E

50|$|The early <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> {{for the new}} U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle {{featured}} recovery on land using {{a combination}} of parachutes and airbags, although it was also designed to make a contingency splashdown (only for an in-flight abort) if needed. Due to weight considerations, the airbag <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> was dropped. The present <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> features landings via splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.|$|R
40|$|Three {{large scale}} {{advanced}} composite shear web components were tested and analyzed to evaluate {{application of the}} <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> to a space shuttle orbiter thrust structure. The shear web <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> consisted of a titanium-clad + or - 45 deg boron/epoxy web laminate stiffened with vertical boron/epoxy reinforced aluminum stiffeners. The <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> was evaluated to be efficient and practical for the application that was studied. Because {{of the effects of}} buckling deflections, a requirement is identified for shear buckling resistant design to maximize the efficiency of highly-loaded advanced composite shear webs. An approximate analysis of prebuckling deflections is presented and computer-aided design results, which consider prebuckling deformations, indicate that the <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> offers a theoretical weight saving of 31 percent relative to all metal construction. Recommendations are made for <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> options and analytical methods that are appropriate for production hardware...|$|R
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb <b>design</b> <b>concepts.</b> However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Public {{anticipation}} for {{the game}} was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for Sonic Unleashed was mixed, with reviewers praising certain elements, such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio {{that make up the}} environments, and criticizing others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and <b>design</b> <b>concepts.</b> Many reviewers felt that Unleashed was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series. Sonic Unleashed was de-listed in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with average or lower Metacritic scores from sale in stores. Despite this, the game was released on the PlayStation Network in April 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. On 20 December 1941, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, the objective of which was to produce reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate plutonium from the uranium, and ultimately to design and build an atomic bomb. This became the Manhattan Project. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising <b>design</b> <b>concepts.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first <b>design</b> <b>concepts</b> at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E
25|$|The authorizing {{legislation}} and Mint procedures gave states a substantial role and considerable discretion {{in determining the}} design that would represent their state. The majority of states followed a {{process by which the}} governor solicited the state's citizens to submit <b>design</b> <b>concepts</b> and appointed an advisory group to oversee the process. Governors submitted three to five finalist <b>design</b> <b>concepts</b> to the secretary of treasury for approval. Approved designs were returned to the states for selection of a final design.|$|E

This is a significant leap in thinking in the history of the design. However, complexity and uncertainty of the "human" factor of the "people foremost" <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> determine the relativity and limitation of its ideological foundation for the design. Meanwhile the "people foremost" <b>design</b> <b>concept</b> exist relative limitations. A "human, machine and environment" comprehensive systematic design should be established for product design.
