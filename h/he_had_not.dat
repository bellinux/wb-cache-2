5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered {{that this was a}} case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, {{an insult to the}} 'August One'.|$|E

60|$|But, {{to return}} to the more {{immediate}} subject of our lucubrations: It seems almost like a fatality, that Lord Byron has hardly ever praised any thing that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> at some other period censured, or censured any thing that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not,</b> by and bye, praised or practised.|$|R

5|$|Banksiamyces is {{classified}} in the Helotiaceae, a widespread but poorly known family of fungi, many species of which are saprobic on herbaceous or woody tissues. The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative, and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order. Based on physical similarity, Wen-Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the Encoelioideae subfamily of the Helotiaceae. He conceded, however, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> examined any specimens.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue.

With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.|$|E
