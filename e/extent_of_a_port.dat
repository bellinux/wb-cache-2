40|$|Performance {{measurement}} is {{a crucial}} exercise in strengthening the competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> since the results provide a benchmark by which the port can be assessed relative to others. <b>A</b> large volume <b>of</b> related literature has been accumulated. Studies on which factors are influential to the overall performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port,</b> however, are limited. Using two simultaneous equations, this paper aims to empirically identify the determinants <b>of</b> <b>port</b> performance with <b>a</b> data set <b>of</b> major container terminals in Asia. A weighted two-stage least square estimation is applied to solve the equations. The findings show that port performance is significantly influenced by berth utilisation. At the same time, other {{factors such as the}} frequency with which shipping lines call at <b>a</b> <b>port,</b> geographical location <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> and economic activities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port's</b> hinterland also play a role in determining <b>a</b> <b>port's</b> performance...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{the method}} is to develop <b>a</b> ‘connectivity score’ <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{particular}} <b>port.</b> Like LSCI, the scores of different ports (for LSCI: countries) can be compared. In addition, and more importantly, the connectivity score <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> can be monitored over time. We propose a method where the connectivity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>port</b> {{is the sum of}} the ‘link qualities’ of all it’s connections based on the 3 attributes of the links (attributes two, three and four in Fig. 1).|$|R
