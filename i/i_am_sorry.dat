25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to {{transmit}} to Your Lordship the disagreeable {{account of a}} disagreeable Business, {{some time in the}} Beginning of this Month, upon news of the Rebel Army approaching, General Carleton set out for Montreal in great Haste; the 7th instant the Rebels landed in the Woods near St. John's, and beat back to their Boats by a Party of Savages incamped at that Place; in this Action the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution, and had they remained firm to our Interests, probably the Province would have been safe for this Year, but finding the Canadians in General averse to the taking up Arms for the Defence of their Country, they withdrew, and made their Peace.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E

500|$|... "To {{those people}} who complained that a {{photograph}} appeared in the press showing Connie and Sam kissing when they did not actually kiss in the transmitted episode, I am afraid I must say a genuine mistake occurred for which I apologise. The only script that ever featured Connie and Sam actually kissing was in the final scene of Episode 44 (transmitted on 29 August). This was edited together as scripted and shot. Nothing was cut [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> if some members of our audience felt cheated. A photographer attended the shoot for Episode 46 and took a selection of shots of Sam and Connie. A photograph from this shoot was mistakenly released and marked as being from Episode 45 as Connie was wearing the same outfit in both episodes. I can only apologise for this mistake. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> a few people had concerns over these episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 14, Manning {{apologized to}} the court: [...] "I am sorry that my actions hurt people.

When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people. ... At {{the time of my}} decisions I was dealing with a lot of issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Picto was Lady Dudley's maid and Thomas Blount {{asked whether}} she thought what had {{happened}} was [...] "chance or villany": she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man nor by herself. For herself, she said, she was a good virtuous gentlewoman, and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, she might have an evil toy [...] in her mind. No, good Mr. Blount, said Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> I said so much.|$|E

500|$|Beauregard {{served as}} {{adjutant}} general for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. In 1888, {{he was elected}} as commissioner of public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying [...] "We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> he is gone. I am no hypocrite." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dark Blues had {{extended}} their {{lead to a}} length by the soap works before shooting Hammersmith Bridge two lengths ahead. [...] Although river traffic diverted the Cambridge boat, they remained in contention, two lengths behind Oxford. [...] At Barnes Bridge, the Dark Blues were a further length ahead, and continued to extend their lead until the flag-boat, which they passed six lengths ahead {{in a time of}} 20 minutes 56 seconds. [...] Oxford's victory, their eighth in a row, took their overall lead to 1510 in the event. Willan paid tribute to his cox: [...] "In conclusion, I must again testify to the splendid steering of Tottenham, who for the fifth and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to say for the last time has contributed mainly to our victory over Cambridge." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> {{to inform you that}} you are the victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
60|$|Peggy and I {{went home}} and told father. We felt very flat, {{but there was nothing}} to be done or said. Father laughed at the whole thing, but I could not laugh. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> for Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> angry with her, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> for Aunt Olivia, too. Plainly she felt badly enough over her {{vanished}} hopes and plans, but she had developed a strange and baffling reserve which nothing could pierce.|$|R

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> {{to inform}} your Excellency that this Country {{has got a}} severe stroke {{by the loss of}} Colonel Lochry and about one hundred (tis said) of the best men of Westmoreland County, {{including}} Captain Stockely & his Company of Rangers. They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and I believe there never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> to {{say that}} {{difficulties}} have been started likely to occasion much trouble and perhaps ultimate defeat. it seems the Appellee [...] has the option of waging Battle and of challenging the Appellor [...] in single combat which if not accepted by the Appellor the suit is lost and, if accepted, and the Appellee can hold out from sun rise to sun set, then he wins the contest and claims his discharge, otherwise his election subjects him not only to a good threshing but also the pain of death into the bargain. It is rumoured here that is the plea intended {{to be set up}} by the Def. and unless we can devise any means by arguement to induce the Court not to allow it, I am very apprehensive our poor little Knight {{will never be able to}} contend the Battle with his brutish opponent.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections.

500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry.</b> I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
500|$|The strike, which {{dragged into}} August, sealed the Tribune's fate. Half the {{editorial}} staff left the newspaper for new jobs during the strike. That summer, Bellows wrote to Matt Meyer, {{the head of}} the new company, that it would be [...] "almost impossible -- with the present staff -- to publish a Herald Tribune I would be proud to be the editor of, or be able to compete with successfully in the morning field." [...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15. [...] "I know we gave something good to our city while we published and I know it will be a loss to journalism in this country as we cease publication," [...] Whitney said. [...] "I am glad that we never tried to cheapen it in any way, that we have served as a conscience and a valuable opposition. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that it had to end." ...|$|E
500|$|Willis {{arbitrarily}} {{refused to}} print {{the work of}} his sister Sara Willis ("Fanny Fern") after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the Home Journal. She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband. Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem [...] "To My Wild Sis". [...] As Fanny Fern, she had published Fern Leaves, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before. Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. [...] "You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me", he wrote. In 1854 she published Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time, a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as [...] "Hyacinth Ellet", an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister's prospects as a writer. Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.|$|E

500|$|In March 2015, Gonzalez {{pleaded guilty}} to two felonies: [...] "entering or {{remaining}} in a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly weapon", and [...] "assaulting a federal officer". In May 2015, Gonzalez {{pleaded guilty to}} the counts of evading police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun in Virginia. He was sentenced to a 15-year suspended sentence and 10 years of supervision. On June 16, 2015 District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sentenced him to a 17-month prison sentence {{to be followed by}} three years of probation. Collyer also ordered Gonzalez to stay out of Washington, D.C., give the secret Service access to his medical records, and give up his firearms and weapons. She addressed Gonzalez directly, saying [...] "No more guns, no more machetes, no more knives, no more tomahawks. Got it?" [...] Gonzalez said [...] "I would like to apologize. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> for my actions. I never meant to harm anyone. I want to commit to maintain my treatment that started at the prison." [...] Prosecutor Vincent Cohen, who had recommended 18 months in prison, stated [...] "Mr. Gonzalez is now paying the price for his foolish decision to jump the fence and run inside the White House. The prison sentence imposed by the court should deter others from taking actions that needlessly put the First Family and White House employees at risk." ...|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1915, Tatiana {{wrote her}} mother another letter expressing {{her desire to}} help her bear the burdens {{brought on by the}} war: [...] "I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, my beloved ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sorry</b> but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
