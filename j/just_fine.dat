500|$|The Hot Rock {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

Huey also praised the band's use of dynamic tempo changes within the album's songs. Wendy Mitchell, writing for CMJ New Music Monthly, felt that the band [...] "has matured into the musical equivalent of a twentysomething; still {{holding on to the}} energy of its youth, but exploring new options".

500|$|The episode's musical {{performances}} were generally well-received, {{though a few}} reviewers, including Benigno, chafed at the continued emphasis on Broadway showtunes. Both of the major dance numbers came in for considerable praise, and [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] garnered the most superlatives: Fallon wrote, [...] "Brittany's performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was thrilling. It was the most adrenaline-pumping musical number the series has produced: intricately choreographed, expertly shot and edited, perfectly woven into the story, and performed exquisitely by Heather Morris." [...] VanDerWerff [...] "enjoyed the ginormous production number built around it quite a bit", and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez called it a [...] "stellar performance".

Variety wrote [...] "If Judy Garland ... is of a mind to work every week with the same dedication and zeal that characterized her premiere this week, Bill Paley and his associates should be in clover. ... Miss Garland was in fine fettle." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle characterized the show as [...] "tasteful, elegant and exciting." [...] Not every review was as glowing, with the New York Herald Tribune noting [...] "Miss Garland is fine, <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> The rest of the show, however, needs help."

Time magazine's Christopher John Farley commented that the song's [...] "groove is penetrating, but the whole thing sounds suspiciously like an Earth, Wind and Fire song that's just on the tip of one's tongue". Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch commented that the song [...] "is a harmless, mid-tempo foot-tapper that will work <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> on Top 40 radio". Edna Gundersen of the USA Today said that Spice [...] "is assembly-line dance-pop", adding that [...] "only the funky 'Say You'll Be There' and touchingly cornball 'Mama' hint at depth".

[...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode. He wrote, [...] "I thought that it was a bit more low key than some of the previous episodes (hilarious sumo outfits not withstanding) and that suited me <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> I thought that Michael's ridiculousness, always a difficult balancing act, was reigned-in to just this side of believable where it belongs.

500|$|Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston's {{appearance}} as {{the highlight of}} the episode. Entertainment Weekly Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox; [...] "Their interactions were along the lines of what I imagine it would have been like if Rachel's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts, and felt that Aniston's performance reminded the audience of her star power. Fallon wrote: [...] "Aniston's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat—and comedically sharp, a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she's played in the years since Friends ended. Last night's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress—and served as a frustrating reminder of what we've been missing since she has [...] abandoned that niche of acting." [...] Sepinwall expressed that Aniston [...] "acquits herself <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> in the small role of Jules' eccentric new therapist. She's likable and daffy but never over-the-top." [...] Hollywood Life journalist Laura Schreffler was not as enthusiastic as the general consensus, avouching that Aniston's guest appearance was overhyped and a [...] "glorified cameo".

Besides plants, the garden had rustic wooden bridges and wooden stairs and a [...] "handsome fountain and central court." [...] A [...] "Shakespeare Garden" [...] was also opened that year, with a grand stairway leading down to it. The next year, park officials realized that the Colonial Garden's construction was of poor quality and hard to cultivate. The garden had to be raised , and a nursery needed to be built to transport the plants during the garden's reconstruction. The rustic wooden bridges were to be replaced with stone bridges, while the wooden stairs were to be superseded by stone stairs. Not only did many plants die during the process, but the actual rebuilding was delayed until 1911. Two years later, the Parks Commissioner for the Bronx refused to allocate reconstruction funds because, he stated, the garden looked <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> Under threat of tearing the garden down, the city had to find money to fill and drain the ground. The rebuilding contract was awarded in 1909 and completed by 1911.|$|E

Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII will do <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E
500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends may be {{surprised}} by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I was scared of the part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie".

500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun".

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of his sophomore season, Ulis announced his intention to forgo his final two seasons of eligibility and enter the 2016 NBA draft. During the 2016 NBA Draft Combine, Ulis {{was not only the}} second-shortest player to participate in the event (behind only Kay Felder, who measured at 5'9.5" [...] with shoes on (5'8.5" [...] without shoes) as opposed to an even 5'10" [...] with shoes on (5.8.75" [...] without them)), but he was also the lightest recorded player in draft combine history at 149 pounds, which affected his draft stock. Furthermore, about two weeks before the draft began, it was revealed that Ulis had a problem with his hip that may one day require surgery. As a result, his draft stock declined from being an expected mid-first round selection to being either a projected late-first round or early-second round selection. Ulis downplayed the issue, claiming that his hip was <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> However, Ulis was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round with their 34th selection, being reunited with his best friend and former college teammate Devin Booker in the process. On July 7, he signed with the Suns and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League. Ulis received the equivalent of a late first-round pick's contract, starting at around $1 million and having the same two guaranteed years with two team option years. In the Summer League, his play compared favorably to the four point guards who were taken in the first round. Over six games at the Las Vegas Summer League, he averaged 14.5 points and 6.3 assists per game, subsequently earning All-NBA Summer League Second Team honors.|$|E
