Yet while it's hard to explain exactly why, it works. It entertains me. At times, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> laugh; at times, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> a little misty-eyed; at times, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to scream and howl and light things on fire and break windows with baseball bats and yes, maybe even buy a Vespa. That's the kind of success that you just can't argue with." ...|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] music video, Grande shot two {{different}} versions. Grande previewed the accompanying music video {{for the single}} through social media on March 26, 2016 and March 29, 2016. The clip was officially premiered on Vevo in the night of March 31, 2016. Directed by production company The Young Astronauts. In interview with Idolator, Grande explained: “We’re doing two visuals because this song makes me feel two kinds of ways, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel sexy and glamorous — I {{wanted to do a}} simpler more glam-themed video — and then I wanted to do another video because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel… like a super version of myself in a way.” Discussing the song with Madeline Rotj from MTV, Grande stated about the concept behind the song's second video: ...|$|E

While trying {{to dispose of}} Alejandro's car, Bree and Gabrielle inadvertently attract Chuck's attention and {{have to create a}} series of elaborate lies to avoid him finding out the truth. Later, Bree receives a note reading, [...] "I know what you did. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> sick. I'm going to tell."

500|$|Rhimes {{felt that}} the 100th episode showed well Meredith's {{evolution}} throughout the show from a [...] "dark and twisty girl" [...] to a [...] "happy woman". She said: [...] "She is the thing her mother wished for her. She is extraordinary. Because, {{to get past the}} crap of your past? To move on? To let the past go and change? That is extraordinary. To love? Without fear? Without screwing it up? That is extraordinary. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> happy to see her happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E

Growing up, I admired {{the kind of}} beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Madonna {{was awarded}} the Artist of the Decade by a poll of MTV viewers in {{recognizing}} her achievement during the 1980s. Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli documented that fellow pop star Michael Jackson had become jealous when Madonna received that honor. He telephoned his attorney John Braca to complain that Madonna did not deserve such an honor. He said, [...] "See, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> look bad. I'm the artist of the decade. Did she outsell Thriller?" [...] In response to his client's agitation, Branca suggested that they approach MTV {{with the idea of}} a fictional award they could give to Jackson. They decided to name it as Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award. Jackson liked the introduction of the award, and commented, [...] "That'll sure teach that heifer", referring to Madonna.|$|E
500|$|The video {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "psychedelic" [...] and as an anthem to Marijuana, rather than one about drunkenness. Brad Wete for Entertainment Weekly explained that Mars was [...] "ready to drown his sorrows in a tall glass of alcohol" [...] and tipped [...] "find out what concoction Mars and Marley are whipping up" [...] by watching the clip. Prefix Magazine s Andrew Winistorfer gave the video a harsh critic, he wrote that the smoke was not the only featured in the video as anyone [...] "get to see Damian Marley sell out in real time". He furthered that Damian, [...] "might as well be in McDonald's commercials.

500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel I can look the East End in the face." ...|$|E

500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to lie on your belly and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2008, Beghe {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. He addressed the 50 protesters gathered {{across the street from}} the Scientology building, and told them: [...] "What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe. Then they hung up." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{said the}} song was {{inspired}} by documentaries about children with cancer. He told biographer Michael Azerrad, [...] "Anytime I think about it, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> sadder than anything I can think of." [...] Azerrad asserted in his biography [...] that despite Cobain's explanation, the song actually appeared to be about Courtney Love. Charles Cross wrote in his Kurt Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven that with the lyric [...] "I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black", the frontman [...] "sang in {{what has to be}} the most convoluted route any songwriter undertook in pop history to say 'I love you'". After a performance of the song by singer Lana Del Rey in 2012, Courtney Love asserted on Twitter that the song is about her vagina. The tweets were deleted shortly after. Cobain said that the song's chorus of [...] "Hey/Wait/I've got a new complaint" [...] was him giving an example of how he was perceived by the media.|$|E

500|$|On Tuesday, 27 July, Harrison and Shankar, {{accompanied}} by a pipe-smoking Allen Klein, {{held a press conference}} to promote the two shows; notoriously performance-shy, Harrison admitted: [...] "Just thinking about <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> shake." [...] The [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] charity single was issued in America on 28 July, with a UK release following two days later. Ringo Starr arrived on the Thursday, and by Friday, 30 July, Russell was in town, interrupting his US tour. Russell's band members Claudia Linnear and Don Preston were added to Don Nix's choir of backing singers; Preston would switch to lead guitar for Russell's solo spot during the shows, just as bassist Carl Radle would replace Voormann temporarily. By this point, Clapton's participation was gravely in doubt, and Harrison had drafted in Jesse Ed Davis as a probable replacement. The ex-Taj Mahal guitarist received last-minute coaching from Voormann, who was more than familiar with Harrison's songs, as well as those by Billy Preston and Starr.|$|E
500|$|Formby {{returned}} to Britain at Christmas and appeared in Dick Whittington at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, {{he appeared in}} variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, The Times thought Formby was [...] "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying [...] "when I look back {{on some of the}} films I've done in the past <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> want to cringe. I'm afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I'm only going to do variety". He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in Cinderella at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions {{other than}} Ireland {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany. George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The {{first night of the}} Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: [...] "I am glad we have been bombed. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> feel we can look the East End in the face." [...] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations {{as the rest of the}} country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.|$|E
