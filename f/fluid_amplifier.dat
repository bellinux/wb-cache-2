50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ <b>fluid</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. <b>Fluid</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{rely on a}} fluid control stream to switch a fluid power stream. <b>Fluid</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are so named because a low-energy fluid control signal can control and switch a high-energy fluid power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the fluid control signal. In <b>fluid</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> a <b>fluid</b> power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying fluid control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit end of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the fluid that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient fluid pressure imbalance adjacent the exit end of the nozzle to effect switching of the fluid power stream.|$|R

40|$|A {{demonstration}} {{system has been}} developed and implemented in which the transport platform of a goods vehicle is decoupled from the bumpiness of the roads and from the acceleration when driving through bends {{by the use of}} ER-fluids. For the drive of valves with ER <b>fluids</b> high-voltage <b>amplifiers</b> with an output voltage of 4. 5 kV and an output power of up to 200 W were developed. The high voltage required was generated by the on-vehicle voltage of 24 V. After extensive system studies and the elaboration of different simulation models the complete control software was developed and successfully integrated into the overall system. The parameters required for the calculation models were identified through measurements and calculations; in particular the static and dynamic transmission behaviour of a valve with ER-fluids was examined in detail within the framework of preliminary tests. With the aid of the simulation models the behaviour of single system elements could be determined and based on this knowledge a suitable control concept could be elaborated. In final field test the function of the {{demonstration system}} could definitely be proved. (orig.)

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} model for predicting {{the characteristics of}} low aspect ratio, symmetrical, radial vortex amplifiers, operating with Newtonian fluids and having turbulent flow within the chamber has been modified to treat the corresponding non-Newtonian case. Comparison of the predicted results with the experimental {{results of this study}} show that the model attains some measure of success, over a limited range of power law index, but fails to properly represent the shape of the characteristic curve. In addition, the influence of the degree of pseudoplasticity of the operating <b>fluid</b> on vortex <b>amplifier</b> characteristics has been experimentally investigated. The experimental conditions included both symmetrical and asymmetrical triodes, conical and cylindrical receivers, discharge directly to atmosphere and also from a submerged exit. Five concentrations of Separan AP- 30 were used, covering a wide range of pseudoplasticity for this solution. The effects of these combinations have been established.

40|$|Many process-control {{systems are}} air-operated. In such an environment, {{it would be}} {{desirable}} and economical to use pneumatic sensors. Bubble-back pressure sensors perform quite satisfactorily, but in case of viscous inflammable and slurry-like liquids with a tendency to froth, this level sensor is inadequate. The method suggested in this paper utilizes a pneumatic capacitor, one boundary of which is formed by the liquid level, to modulate a <b>fluid</b> <b>amplifier</b> feedback oscillator. The absence of moving parts and economy obtained makes this method attractive for process-control applications. The system has been mathematically modeled and simulated on an IBM 360 / 44 digital computer. Experimental values compare fairly well with the theoretical results.

40|$|An optical {{servo system}} is a new control system {{that can be used}} in {{hazardous}} environments. The purpose of our study is to develop such an optical control system. In a previous study, we had realized an optical control system that executed cart positioning using optical control signals instead of electric signals. We developed an optical servo valve in which the output pressure was proportional to input optical power. As a next step, we needed to develop another type of optical valve in order to get higher-pressure gain. In this study, we propose and produce an optical on-off valve that consists of an optical on-off device and a <b>fluid</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and the structure, operating principle and fundamental characteristics of the valve are investigated. As the result, we obtained a higher output pressure of the tested valve compared with the previous one.

And finally, we improved the dynamics of the device by using a feedback passage plate based on analytical results of the device...|$|E
40|$|Resistors are {{considered}} to be indispensable passive elements to make up pneumatic circuits and to invesngate characteristics of a <b>fluid</b> <b>amplifier,</b> but few resistors which have linear characteristics have been found. 　A new type resistor, slit type resistor, made of a brass bar is proposed in this paper. Slits are cut from the outer surface of the circumference {{to the center of the}} bar as many as possible. Supposing the cross section of a slit is a rectangle, the theory is obtained by considering all slits as the collection of rectangular tubes. Their static characteristics are almost linear and well confirmed the theory. 　These slit type resistors are easily made by machine tool, however, it is difficuit to make them in the case that the bar has a small diameter (under φ 5). Therefore, it is convenient to connect the resistors with a large diameter to a tube with a small diameter. And then, several connectors such as enlargements and contractions are made, and static characteristics of these resistors are investigated. The results are summarised as follows:　 1) It is desirable to narrow the width of a slit and to increase the depth and the number of it. 　 2) The length of resistors is desirable to be chosen about 35 - 65 mm. 　 3) Series and parallel connection of these resistors are now available keeping the linear characteristics. In the series connection, the interval between each resistor does not affect the total resistance. Nor the branched angle does in the parallel connection. 　 4) Geometrical configurations of connectors do not affect the static characteristics though loss coefficient of pressure are large at low Reynolds number. 　 5) The change of the diameter of slender tubes does not affect the static characteristics to the extent (d_ 2) /(d_ 1...|$|E
