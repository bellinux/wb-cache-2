50|$|Introduced to the {{mezzotint}} engraver, John Bonnar, James {{became interested}} in a more rapid process for preparing the plate for the engraver - possibly the engineering streak in him his father noticed. He also developed an intense interest in mezzotinting and soon began his career in that art and as an <b>engraver</b> in <b>general.</b> As a mezzotinter, for over fifty years, he was possibly only excelled in his day by Samuel Cousins (1801-1887). Several of Faed's mezzotints were commissioned by the Royal Association for the Promotion of Fine Arts in Scotland.|$|R
60|$|That bleak {{little house}} is clearly defined {{in my mind}} at this moment. The low lean-to kitchen, the rag-carpeted sitting room with its two chromos of Wide Awake and Fast Asleep--its steel <b>engraving</b> of <b>General</b> Grant, and its tiny melodeon in the corner--all these come back to me. There are very few books or {{magazines}} in the scene, but there are piles of newspapers, for my father was an omnivorous reader of all things political. It was not a hovel, it was a pioneer cabin persisting into a settled community, that was all.|$|R

Sun Hao regarded it as an omen and sent a minister called Dong Chao to this mountain where he offered sacrifices to heaven and earth and set up a monument which was later referred to as Guoshan Stele. With a height of 2.35 meters, the stele had a cylindrical shape and was <b>engraved</b> by <b>General</b> Sun Jian with Zhuan-style characters [...] totalling 43 lines of 25 words.

50|$|The two first postal stamps {{issued in}} France {{were of the}} Ceres series. They were printed with the effigy of Ceres, goddess of growing plants in Roman mythology. She wore a garland of wheat {{and a bunch of}} grapes in her hair. The design, which avoided any {{specifically}} republican or Revolutionary connotations, was drawn by Jacques-Jean Barre, <b>general</b> <b>engraver</b> at the Paris Mint, under the supervision of Anatole Hulot, a civil servant who obtained the right to print the stamps at the Mint until 1876.|$|R
5000|$|In {{appearance}} he was diminutive and corpulent; he had bushy, meeting brows (Parr styled him [...] "the gentleman {{with the}} straw-coloured eyebrows"), a shrill voice, and rapid utterance. He was careless and shabby in his dress, except on Sundays, {{when he was}} scrupulously clean and neat. His portrait, from a drawing taken by Minasi {{a few weeks before}} his death, has been <b>engraved.</b> His <b>general</b> appearance gained him the nickname of the [...] "Knave of Clubs", though he was usually styled [...] "St. Crispin". Accounts of his character portray him as unconventional, quick-tempered, amiably eccentric and rather abrupt. His friend Joseph Aston wrote a tribute to him in the Manchester Exchange Herald which mentioned his undeviating love of truth and spirit of forgiveness, though [...] "deficient in some of those qualities which are too often the apologies for the absence of more substantial virtues".|$|R
