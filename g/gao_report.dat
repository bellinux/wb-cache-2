5|$|The GAO {{released}} its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation {{determined that the}} USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The <b>GAO</b> <b>report,</b> however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS {{as required by the}} ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The <b>GAO</b> <b>report</b> added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, the US101 was {{selected}} for the VXX Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program, and was promptly re-designated as the VH-71. However, development was subject to delays, cost overruns, and engineering issues; Lockheed attributed much of these issues to unanticipated and extensive modifications being demanded by the government that had been absent from the request for proposal (RFP) issued. A Government Accountability Office (<b>GAO)</b> <b>report</b> in 2011 also recognised {{that a lack of}} flexibility and compromise {{on the part of the}} government had negatively impacted the programme. By late 2008, the cancellation of the VH-71 was looking increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|Under the O Act, the Department of the Interior {{under its}} General Land Office and later succeeded by the Bureau of Land Management, managed more than 44 billion board feet of {{standing}} inventory in 1937 {{into more than}} 60 billion board feet by the mid-1990s, and harvested more than 44 billion board feet over that time period. In 1951, the U.S. Treasury had been fully reimbursed, and the 25 percent of the revenue that had previously gone to the Treasury now reverted to the counties; in 1953, the counties opted to divert that money to maintenance {{of the land and}} roads, reforestation, as well as recreational facilities and other improvements. A 1970 <b>GAO</b> <b>report</b> contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969, the counties had received a total of $300 million {{as a result of the}} Act.

25|$|The <b>GAO</b> <b>report</b> also {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which {{are just a few}} feet from the structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building is too small to accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency has leased space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in multi-tenant buildings.

At the program level, in January 2012, <b>GAO</b> <b>reported</b> that TSA did not fully follow DHS acquisition policies when acquiring advanced imaging technology (AIT) commonly referred to as a full body scanner that identifies objects or anomalies on the outside of the bodywhich resulted in DHS approving full AIT deployment without full knowledge of TSAs revised specifications. In July 2011, <b>GAO</b> <b>reported</b> that in 2010 TSA revised its explosive detection systems (EDS) requirements to better address current threats and planned to implement these requirements in a phased approach; however, <b>GAO</b> <b>reported</b> that some number of the EDSs in TSAs fleet were configured to detect explosives at the levels established in 2005 while the remaining ones were configured to detect explosives at 1998 levels and TSA did not have a plan with time frames needed to deploy EDSs to meet the current requirements. ...|$|R
25|$|CBO {{reported}} that net {{interest on the}} public debt was approximately $240 billion in FY2016 (6% of spending), an increase of $17 billion or 8% versus FY2015. A higher level of debt coincided with higher interest rates. During FY2012, the <b>GAO</b> <b>reported</b> a figure of $245 billion, down from $251 billion. Government also accrued a non-cash interest expense of $187 billion for intra-governmental debt, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund, for a total interest expense of $432 billion. <b>GAO</b> <b>reported</b> {{that even though the}} national debt rose in FY2012, the interest rate paid declined.

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a <b>GAO</b> <b>report</b> to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E
500|$|During {{dialogue}} {{over the}} CSAR-X (in which the EH101 was LMSI's offering), the Air Force Source Selection Authority (SSA) stated the program's performance had been [...] "unsatisfactory". In March 2007, a Government Accountability Office (<b>GAO)</b> <b>report,</b> upholding Sikorsky and Lockheed's protests against Boeing's HH-47, mentioned [...] "LMSI {{had received a}} little confidence rating for past performance due to unsatisfactory performance under its current contract for the VH-71 Presidential helicopter, which was evaluated as the most highly relevant to this procurement." [...] The SSA stated that LMSI had [...] "show {{that it could not}} reliably meet important schedule requirements and had difficulty in systems engineering flow-downs to their subcontractors." [...] Lockheed responded that government insistence on extensive modifications, unanticipated in the RFP, as the source of cost overruns.
