40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurement of soil {{compaction}} caused by vehicle loading {{is difficult and}} often subject to extreme variability. Two types of soil transducers were compared in an experiment conducted in a Norfolk sandy loam soil in the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory’s (NSDL) soil bin facilities. Stress-state transducers (SSTs), electronic transducers developed at the NSDL for measuring six directional pressures and determining the stress state, were used for this experiment. Rubber bulbs connected by a rubber hose to a <b>dial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge,</b> which measure hydrostatic pressure, were also used in this experiment. Both transducers were buried at depths of 7. 5, 15, or 23 cm and were used to measure soil pressures caused by a 30. 5 L- 32 tire with dynamic loads of 19 or 37 kN. The SSTs were buried by inserting them into an excavated hole, while the rubber bulbs were inserted with a special tool designed to leave the soil surface and surrounding soil undisturbed. Peak values of mean normal stress (calculated from measurements of pressure) from the SSTs and hydrostatic pressure measured with the rubber bulbs {{were found to be}} affected by both loading and burial depth. Similar magnitudes and variation were observed for each transducer. Residual pressure, defined as the pressure remaining after loading was removed, was found to be affected by both loading and burial depth when measured with the rubber bulbs. Continued development and testing of the rubber bulb transducers could provide a simple method of determining levels of compaction that could damage soils an...|$|E
40|$|Several {{commercial}} {{instruments are}} available for pressure measurements. As per ISO stipulations, whenever such instruments are used for precise and accurate pressure measurements, it is obligatory {{on the part of}} measurement authority to indicate the quality of results. Stability of the pressure measuring instruments over the years is one of the important parameters in defining the quality of results quantitatively. Also, it helps the users to decide the optimum calibration interval of the particular instrument. In the present investigation, we have studied a number of analogue / digital pressure transducers / transmitters / calibrators and <b>pressure</b> <b>dial</b> <b>gauges.</b> The present paper describes the results of the studies carried out on several <b>pressure</b> <b>dial</b> <b>gauges</b> and transducers in the pressure range up to 500 MPa, calibrated several times over the years, as examples. A new approach is proposed for the establishment of measurement uncertainty for such instruments by characterizing the data obtained during calibration over the years using curve fitting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{objective}} of the present work was studying the technique of modal analysis using theoretical, numerical and experimental methods. Two axis modal finger of pneumatic robotic hand was designed and built. The theoretical modeling was done by deriving equations of stress and deflection depending on the free body diagram of robotic clamp, finite element analysis was performed using Comsol Multi physics 3. 5 a software program. The modal testing was done by <b>dial</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges.</b> For each method dynamic stress and deflection were found, and the results from all three analyses were compared and proved that the rated deflection and stresses that calculated from the theoretical calculation make a good agreement with the results obtained from the finite element analysis and experimental testing. The acceptable maximum holding weight of designed hand was found to b...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{performance}} of calibration laboratories in the pneumatic pressure region (0 to 5) MPa through a recently conducted inter-laboratory comparison. Six NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited laboratories participated in the program. The proficiency testing program was organized and piloted by CSIR-National Physical Laboratory. The program started in June 2010 and was completed in October 2011. The artifact used was a high precision <b>pressure</b> <b>dial</b> <b>gauge.</b> The reference values were generated by the pilot laboratory. The deviations for each participating laboratory were estimated against the reference pressure values and the compatibility of the results was calculated using the conventional method.

The results thus obtained show that out of the total 159 measurement results, 135 (84. 91 %) are found in good agreement with {{the results of}} the reference laboratory. The relative deviations between laboratories values and reference values are well within 0. 15 % for 75 measurement points, 0. 25 % for 108 measurement points and 0. 50 % for 148 measurement points. The difference of the laboratories values with reference values are found almost well within the uncertainty band of the reference values at 71. 07 % measurement results, within their reported expanded uncertainty band at 62. 26 % measurement results and within the combined expanded measurement uncertainty band at 84. 91 % measurement results.

The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a case of}} constant-rate liquid {{production}} from a single well centered in a horizontal, homogeneous-acting, isopachous, and infinite reservoir, based on fundamentals of fluid flow in porous media the bottom hole flowing pressure never stabilize. In the process of field well testing, however, pressure values measured by the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> which has a definite resolution value will not change after a period, so the bottom hole flowing pressure can {{be considered to be}} stabilized. According to this situation, through theoretical derivation, a stabilized time formula is firstly proposed, by which the time after which the bottom hole flowing pressure measured with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> will be stabilized can be calculated, and the stabilized time for a given <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> is in direct proportion to the liquid producing rate, but in inverse proportion to the resolution ratio of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge.</b> Applied the stabilized time formula, a new formula of detectable radius can be derived, by which the effect of resolution of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be considered. Secondly, the time after which the value of the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> measured in the bottom hole of the observation well starts to change during interference testing is obtained, and the time is related to the fluid flow rate and the distance between the producing well and the observation well. The conclusion can be applied as a reference in the design process of working system during well testing...|$|R
