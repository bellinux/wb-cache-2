5|$|The pre-show {{match was}} a fatal-four-way {{elimination}} tag team {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso), RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando), accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Cesaro), accompanied by Zeb Colter. The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway. Five minutes into the match, Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature Neutralizer to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven-minute mark. Later, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock. Colter demanded that they put their differences aside, but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off.|$|E

25|$|Sakuraba {{became known}} for a unique, unorthodox {{fighting}} style which can be most described as creative. He used in the ring moves and techniques from professional wrestling, among them spinning sole kicks, jumping stomps, Mongolian chops and baseball slides. He also used cartwheels to pass guard and several kinds of confusing, often comical tricks to gain advantage over his opponent. However, his main strength was his rounded set of abilities come from shoot-style wrestling, which included a grinding striking learned from muay thai and a brilliant catch wrestling submission expertise. He submitted important grapplers of his time like Royler Gracie, Renzo Gracie and Masakatsu Funaki by using his signature <b>double</b> <b>top</b> wrist lock, a technique he opened both from standing and on the ground. Though he didn't fear giving his back to his opponent {{in order to secure}} it, Sakuraba would also use the technique as a positional weapon, threatening with them to control his adversary. Renzo Gracie praised his ability to play against his opponent's weaknesses, and Mark Kerr called him the world's best technician at his time.|$|E

Joseph Brent's mandolin, made by Brian Dean also uses what Brent calls a false back. [...] Brent's mandolin was the luthier's solution to Brent's request for a loud mandolin in which the wood was clearly audible, with less metallic sound from the strings. The type used by Avital is variation of the flatback, with a <b>double</b> <b>top</b> that encloses a resonating chamber, sound holes on the side, and a convex back. It is made by one manufacturer in Israel, luthier Arik Kerman. Other players of Kerman mandolins include Alon Sariel, Jacob Reuven, and Tom Cohen.|$|E

60|$|The tubes were rectangular, with <b>double</b> <b>top</b> {{and bottom}} made of plates of wrought-iron, from three-eighths to three-quarters {{of an inch}} thick, and varying in length {{according}} to their position--the whole when put together forming a single tube about 500 yards long. The two centre ones were {{the largest and most}} difficult to manage, each having to be built on shore, floated off on barges, and lifted by hydraulic power a height of about 100 feet. Some idea of what this implied may be gathered from the following fact. Each tube weighed 1800 tons--the weight of a goodly-sized ocean steamer! A perfect army of men worked at the building of the tubes; cutting, punching, fitting, riveting, etcetera, and as the place became the temporary abode of so many artificers and labourers, with their wives and children, a village sprang up around them, with shops, a school, and a surgery. Two fire-engines and large tanks of water were kept in constant readiness in case of fire, and for many months rivet-making machines, punching machines, shearing machines, etcetera, were in full work. There were two million rivets used altogether, and the quantity of three-quarter-inch iron rod used in making them measured 126 miles. The total weight of iron used was nearly 12,000 tons. The bridge was strengthened by eighty-three miles of angle iron. For many months the outlay in wages alone was 6000 pounds a week, and the cost for the whole of the works more than 600,000 pounds. A curious fact connected with this enormous mass of iron is, that arrangements had to be made to permit of shrinkage and expansion. The tubes were placed on a series of rollers and iron balls, and it was afterwards found that in the hottest part of summer they were twelve inches longer than in winter--a difference which, if not provided for, would have caused the destruction of the towers by a constant and irresistible pull and thrust! The Menai Bridge was begun in 1846 and opened for traffic in March 1850.|$|E
