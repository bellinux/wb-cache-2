30|$|Inspired by the {{aforementioned}} discussion, {{this is the}} first time that the exponential stabilization criteria for a nonlinear system with mixed time-varying delay via hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control have been studied. The main contributions of this paper lie in the following aspects. Firstly, the time-varying delays are mixture of discrete and distributed time-varying delays in a nonlinear system and hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control. The constraint on the derivative of the time-varying delays is not required. So, this allows the time delay to be a fast time-varying function, which is different from the time delays in [7, 12, 15, 38, 40]. Secondly, for the control method, the exponential stabilization criteria for nonlinear system are studied via hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control, containing state term, interval time-varying delay term and distributed time-varying delay term. It is different from the control method in [6, 9, 10, 13, 37, 38, 40]. From the above discussions, this work is one of the first reports of such investigation to further develop the exponential stabilization criteria for a nonlinear system with mixed time-varying delays via hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control. By constructing the set of improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with Leibniz-Newton’s formula, Jensen’s inequality, and the reciprocal convex combination technique, a new delay-dependent sufficient condition of exponential stabilization criteria is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The obtained LMIs are efficiently solved by standard convex optimization algorithms. A numerical example is included to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control scheme.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, the {{exponential}} stabilization {{criterion of}} a nonlinear system with mixed time-varying delays via hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control was investigated. The time-varying delay functions are {{not necessary to}} be differentiable, which allows time delay functions to be fast time-varying functions. Moreover, hybrid <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback</b> control, including state term, interval time-varying delay term and distributed time-varying delay term, was considered for the exponential stabilization of the nonlinear system. Based on constructing an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, Leibniz-Newton’s formula, Jensen’s inequality, reciprocal convex and novel delay-dependent sufficient condition for the exponential stabilization of the system are first achieved in terms of LMIs.

However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} for these therapeutic effects have not been previously described. Objectives We attempted to delineate the changes in corticospinal excitability when individuals were asked to exercise their upper extremity using a real mirror and virtual mirror. Moreover, we attempted to delineate the role of visual modulation within the virtual environment that affected corticospinal excitability in healthy subjects and stroke patients. Methods A total of 18 healthy subjects and 18 hemiplegic patients were enrolled into the study. Motor evoked potential (MEP) s from transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded in the flexor carpi radialis of the non-dominant or affected upper extremity using three different conditions: (A) relaxation; (B) real mirror; and (C) virtual mirror. Moreover, we compared the MEPs from the virtual mirror paradigm using continuous visual <b>feedback</b> or <b>intermittent</b> visual <b>feedback.</b> Results The rates of amplitude increment and latency decrement of MEPs in both groups were higher during the virtual mirror task than during the real mirror. In healthy subjects and stroke patients, the virtual mirror task with <b>intermittent</b> visual <b>feedback</b> significantly facilitated corticospinal excitability of MEPs compared with continuous visual feedback. Conclusion Corticospinal excitability was facilitated {{to a greater extent}} in the virtual mirror paradigm than in the real mirror and in <b>intermittent</b> visual <b>feedback</b> than in the continuous visual feedback, in both groups. This provides neurophysiological evidence supporting the application of the virtual mirror paradigm using various visual modulation technologies to upper extremity rehabilitation in stroke patients. </p...|$|R

We implemented computer simulation of a quadruple inverted pendulum that is mechanically close to human tiptoe standing. We simulated three pairs of joint viscoelasticity and three choices of neural control strategies for each joint: intermittent, continuous, or passive control. We examined postural robustness for each parameter set by analysing the region of active feedback gain.

40|$|Abstract The {{paradigm}} of continuous control using inter-nal models has advanced {{understanding of human}} motor control.

It is shown that event-driven intermittent control provides a framework to explain the behaviour of the human oper-ator under {{a wider range of}} conditions than continuous control. Continuous control is included as a special case, but sampling, system matched hold, an intermittent pre-dictor and an event trigger allow serial open-loop trajecto-ries using <b>intermittent</b> <b>feedback.</b> The implementation here may be described as “continuous observation, intermittent action”. Beyond explaining unimodal regulation distribu-tions in common with continuous control, these features naturally explain refractoriness and bimodal stabilisation distributions observed in double stimulus tracking experi-ments and quiet standing, respectively.

The constraint on the derivative of the time-varying delay is not required which allows the time-delay to be a fast time-varying function.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of an inverted pendulum on a manually controlled cart (cart-inverted-pendulum; CIP) in an upright position, which {{is analogous to}} balancing a stick on a fingertip, is considered in order to investigate how the human central nervous system (CNS) stabilizes unstable dynamics due to mechanical instability and time delays in neural feedback control. We explore {{the possibility that a}} type of <b>intermittent</b> time-delayed <b>feedback</b> control, which has been proposed for human postural control during quiet standing, is also a promising strategy for the CIP task and stick balancing on a fingertip. Such a strategy hypothesizes that the CNS exploits transient contracting dynamics along a stable manifold of a saddle-type unstable upright equilibrium of the inverted pendulum in the absence of control by inactivating neural feedback control intermittently for compensating delay-induced instability. To this end, the motions of a CIP stabilized by human subjects were experimentally acquired, and computational models of the system were employed to characterize the experimental behaviors. We first confirmed fat-tailed non-Gaussian temporal fluctuation in the acceleration distribution of the pendulum, as well as the power-law distributions of corrective cart movements for skilled subjects, which was previously reported for stick balancing. We then showed that the experimental behaviors could be better described by the models with an <b>intermittent</b> delayed <b>feedback</b> controller than by those with the conventional continuous delayed feedback controller, suggesting that the human CNS stabilizes the upright posture of the pendulum by utilizing the intermittent delayed feedback-control strategy...|$|R
