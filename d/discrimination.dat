40|$|Compelling {{evidence}} {{stemming from}} past {{research suggests that}} {{a wide variety of}} visual search tasks can undergo perceptual learning. Such learning is typically characterized by a marked improvement in the speed and accuracy of target detection or identification by observers, as a result of repeated practice with the visual search task at hand. For difficult visual <b>discriminations,</b> the improvement in visual search performance associated with perceptual learning {{has been shown to be}} specific to the training context. Such contexts include, but are not limited to, the trained target stimuli and their trained retinal positions within the visual field. The current compilation of psychophysical experiments aimed to investigate an aspect of perceptual learning specificity in difficult visual <b>discriminations</b> previously unreported in the relevant literature. These experiments assessed whether perceptual learning for difficult visual <b>discriminations</b> is specific to the trained context of stimulus display durations in which such <b>discriminations</b> are embedded. With training, a significant improvement in performance for trials with a 50 -millisecond stimulus display duration (difficult <b>discriminations)</b> resulted when such trials were embedded within sessions containing a variety of longer stimulus display durations (easier <b>discriminations).</b> However, this improvement was lost when difficult trials were no longer embedded within the context of easier trials. These findings may supplement our current knowledge regarding the perceptual plasticity of the visual system...|$|R

40|$|Three adult {{subjects}} were taught {{a set of}} two-choice simultaneous <b>discriminations,</b> with three positive and three negative stimuli; all possible combinations {{of positive and negative}} stimuli yielded nine different pairs.

With all subjects, a reversal of the contingencies for one pair of stimuli became sufficient to change their responses to all of the other pairs. The reversals had produced functional stimulus classes. Then, all subjects showed conditional <b>discriminations</b> emerging between members of a functional class; given a sample from one class and comparisons from both classes, they selected the comparison that was in the same class as the sample. Next, 2 of the subjects showed that the within-class conditional relations possessed the symmetric and transitive properties of equivalence relations; after having been taught to relate new stimuli to existing class members, the subjects then matched other class members to the new stimuli. Subsequent tests of two-choice <b>discriminations</b> showed that the conditional <b>discriminations</b> had transferred functional class membership to the new stimuli. The 3 rd subject, who did not show equivalence relations among functional class members, was also found to have lost the within-class conditional relations after the equivalence tests...|$|R
