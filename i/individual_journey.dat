"An Imaginary Life is, in part, {{about an}} <b>individual</b> <b>journey</b> {{from a state}} of being cut off and apart from the {{environment}} - of wishing to tame and exploit nature, of being totally entangled in language and culture - {{to a state of}} being in intimate contact with the untrained, wild things of the world. It is also about a poet, in thrall of civilisation, realising that {{there are other ways to}} live and experience; ways that are beautiful and fulfilling...Those themes - of belonging and exile, of how to relate to the environment and to those who are different to us - are core to the debate about what it means to be Australian today. An Imaginary Life does not provide a workable template for how to navigate the complexity of belonging and un-belonging, nor should it. It’s a novel not a policy document. It does, however, show us it is possible to imagine ways to do things differently, ways to live differently with each other and with nature. And once imagined, those other ways of living seem all the more possible." ...|$|E

The title of this journal may look surprising to some readers. There may even be a legitimate doubt as to whether the journal would take-off at all, the title being so broad and unspecific. On the contrary, to be more optimistic, the journal could meet a long-felt need, i. e., that of bringing researchers, and various forms of organised inquiry, into fruitful connections with each other, without the restrictions imposed by formal disciplinary boundaries...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is becoming}} a serious environmental threat that must be resolved quickly. Traditionally, travel information systems have been specific to a particular mode of transport. For instance, traffic information (road conditions broadcast) has been directed at drivers. Instead, travel information systems are now being developed which incorporate route guidance systems to divert drivers away from the congested areas either by change of travel mode or travel route. The mobile travel information system developed at The Nottingham Trent University enables progression from a passive mode of interaction between traffic control systems and road-users (one-way flow of information) to an active mode. The integration of data concerning traffic flows and <b>individual</b> <b>journey</b> plans thus {{makes it possible to}} perform optimisation of travel. We focus on the issue of provision of real-time information about urban travel and assistance with planning travel. Nottingham's SCOOT (split cycle offset optimisation techniq...|$|E

In this context, the paper also examines how practitioners can enhance client's capacities and instil a sense of hope, and empower the families and careers through this journey.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} idea that the {{influences}} of Sufism and the poetry of Rumi in contemporary literature challenge perspectives concerning the Islamic representation in the world today by specifically urging for a universal and borderless love between Eastern and Western cultures. Despite being older forms of teaching, the philosophy of Sufism and the poetry of Rumi are still beneficial and relatable to the modern world, essentially urging individuals to find radical love within themselves and, in turn, to find unity with humanity. This radical Love is a transforming force, offering spiritual rebirth, as it surpasses labels, borders, economic globalization, and political corruption as evident in the novels discussed in this thesis. This thesis explores the relationship of Rumi and Sufism to the universe and the <b>individual</b> <b>journey</b> to love by specifically analyzing the journeys of the characters in Elif Shafak’s The Forty Rules of Love, Mohsin Hamid’s How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, and Naguib Mahfouz’s Arabian Nights and Days...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} model the {{distribution}} characteristics of public bicycle rental durations, <b>individual</b> <b>journey</b> data for three cities in China (Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Beijing), for weekdays, was obtained. The distribution curves for public bicycle rental duration in the three cities {{were found to be}} extremely similar, with small differences among the weekdays. The basic parameters such as the average rental duration, the rental duration corresponding to the maximum rental frequency, and the rental duration corresponding to 75 % degree were then calculated. On this basis, the radioactive decay law from physics was used to establish a theoretical model for the relationship between rental frequency and rental duration. The data on public bicycle rental duration in Ningbo, Hangzhou, and Beijing were used to test the model and produce a corrected theoretical model. The results indicate that the relationship between rental frequency and rental duration obeys the decay law. The study results provide important theoretical support for the rental station planning of bicycle sharing systems, as well as the allocation, operation, and dispatch of public bicycles...|$|E
40|$|What {{should and}} should not be taught in science {{classrooms}} in Mozambique? Who should decide? This paper, based on the arts-based doctoral research of an African science teacher educator, addresses these questions. I (Cupane) am contributing from my cultural perspective and from my understanding of who we (Mozambicans) are; from my understanding of why and how we can have a Mozambican science classroom in our setting; and, from my understanding of the desirable contribution of science education to our cultural well being. My aim in this paper is to show that the inclusion of local (indigenous) knowledge in our curriculum is one way of addressing in a culturally inclusive manner the above questions. I have used auto/biographical research methods to understand my self as both an individual and a professional science educator. The study reflects the development of my values and attitudes in my life and profession, and how I have reinforced, changed and developed new values during this research. Thus, the study reflects my <b>individual</b> <b>journey</b> in life, as well as the struggles that exist in Mozambican society because of the dialectical relationship that exists between me and Mozambican society and the world at large...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that social prescribing schemes can offer health and psychological wellbeing benefits to older people across {{a range of}} interventions. The present study sought to understand how museum programmes, designed to support socially isolated older adults, created opportunities to enhance wellbeing and change experiences of social isolation. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse initial interviews, 3 -month follow-up interviews, and participant diaries, from 12 participants who took part in 10 -week programmes across six different museums in London and Kent. A theoretical model was developed showing elements of museum programmes, such as the role of the facilitator, activities and physical space, that enabled both <b>individual</b> <b>journeys</b> and relational processes. In addition, <b>individual</b> <b>journeys</b> and relational processes influenced each other, enhancing the experience. These components operated within an interacting social context that was enriched by the museum programme. The theoretical model links with psychological concepts of attachment theory and self-esteem to explain how cultural group programmes could provide opportunities for change in older people. Limitations of the research, implications for clinical practice and recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R
