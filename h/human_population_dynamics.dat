In our study, we use daily temperature and rainfall as model inputs to simulate dynamics of mosquito vectors population in relation to disease epidemics.

An open-source modelling platforms, Universal Simulator and Qt integrated development environment were used to develop models in C++ programming language.

We investigate how temporal and spatial climatic fluctuations shape variation in agricultural production across dryland landscapes. We use a model that couples plant growth, climate, and soil organic matter dynamics, together with data from Kohala, Hawai’i, to understand how temperature, rainfall, nitrogen availability, and cropping activity interact to determine yield dynamics through time and space. Due to these interactions, the statistical characterization of rainfall alone is a poor characterization of agricultural yield. Using a simple linear model of <b>human</b> <b>population</b> <b>dynamics,</b> we show that the observed yield variation can affect long-term population growth substantially. Our approach to analyzing spatial and temporal fluctuations in food supply, and to interpreting the population consequences of these fluctuations, provides a quantitative evaluation of agricultural risk and human carrying capacity in dry regions...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Anthropology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. The {{study of}} human {{population}} {{has a long history}} in American archaeology, where it has {{played a central role in}} the study of settlement and subsistence patterns, sociocultural evolution, and technological change. Population estimates for Owens Valley, California have historically relied on ethnographic accounts and an underlying assumption that populations were small and grew gradually over time. This research seeks to improve our understanding of <b>human</b> <b>population</b> <b>dynamics</b> over the last 3200 years in Owens Valley using archaeological, ethnographic, and carrying capacity data. The archaeological data include the number and location ofprehistoric sites, projectile point and handstone counts, obsidian hydration readings, and number of structures. Ethnographic evidence consists ofpopulation estimates made by Steward (1938), Wilke and Lawton (1976), and others. Finally, carrying capacity was assessed on the basis of aboriginally exploitedplant and animalfood resources documented in archaeological and ethnographic sources. Analysis suggests that the human population of Owens Valley grew slowly through the early Newberry period, but gained momentum at the Newberry-Haiwee period transition (ca. 1500 - 1300 BP), and thereafter until historic contact in the mid 19 th century. The evidence indicates that populations doubled every 550 to 750 years during this interval. The correlation of subsistence resources and increasing population is supported by a combination of both archaeological and ethnographic data. All of the data indicate that ethnographic estimates of 1000 people at Euroamerican contact are more accurate than the higher figures proposed by some investigations. Evidence further suggests that the number of sites, projectile points, and obsidian hydration afford the best predictors of <b>human</b> <b>population</b> <b>dynamics</b> in prehistory. Changes in the number of handstones, by contrast, appear to signal technological shifts that accompanied an intensification in seed use, rather than population growth alone. Finally, the use or number of structures remains inconclusive, but promising, as a proxy measure for demographic change. In sum, the combination of archaeological, ethnographic, and carrying capacity data allow for more reliable population estimates and growth rates than previous approaches to this longstanding issue in prehistory.

40|$|<b>Population</b> <b>dynamics</b> is a South African {{secondary}} school biology syllabus topic which deals specifically with ecology or concepts {{within the realm}} of ecology. It is currently taught in a way which largely emphasises the teaching and learning of facts and concepts, often out of any context to which students can relate. While it is important to convey scientific concepts, it is just as important to address social and political issues regarding overpopulation and the environment.

Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline.
