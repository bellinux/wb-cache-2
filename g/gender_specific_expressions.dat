40|$|In {{the present}} study, we perform an {{association}} analysis {{focusing on the}} expression changes of 1344 RNA Binding proteins (RBPs) {{as a function of}} age and gender in human liver. We identify 88 and 45 RBPs to be significantly associated with age and gender respectively. Experimental verification of several of the predicted associations in mice confirmed our findings. Our results suggest that {{a small fraction of the}} gender-associated RBPs (~ 40 %) are expressed higher in males than females. Altogether, these observations show that several of these RBPs are important and conserved regulators in maintaining liver function. Further analysis of the protein interaction network of RBPs associated with age and gender based on the centrality measures like degree, betweenness and closeness revealed that several of these RBPs might be prominent players in aging liver and impart <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> alterations in gene expression via the formation of protein complexes. Indeed, both age and gender-associated RBPs in liver were found to show significantly higher clustering coefficients and network centrality measures compared to non-associated RBPs.

40|$|Effective {{diagnosis}} and surveillance of complex multi-factorial {{disorders such as}} cancer can be improved by screening of easily accessible biomarkers. Highly stable cell free Circulating Nucleic Acids (CNA) present as both RNA and DNA species have been discovered in the blood and plasma of humans. Correlations between tumor-associated genomic/epigenetic/ transcriptional changes and alterations in CNA levels are strong predictors of the utility of this biomarker class as promising clinical indicators. Towards this goal microRNAs (miRNAs) representing a class of naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs of 19 – 25 nt in length have emerged as an important set of markers that can associate their <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> profiles with cancer development. In this study we investigate some of the pre-analytic considerations for isolating plasma fractions {{for the study of}} miRNA biomarkers. We find that measurement of circulating miRNA levels are frequently confounded by varying levels of cellular miRNAs of different hematopoietic origins. In order to assess the relative proportions of this cell-derived class, we have fractionated whole blood into plasma and its ensuing sub-fractions. Cellular miRNA signatures in cohorts of normal individuals are catalogued and the abundance and <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> of bona fide circulating markers explored after calibrating the signal for this interfering class. A map of differentially expressed profiles is presented and the intrinsic variability of circulating miRNA species investigated in subsets of healthy males and females...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background GGAs (Golgi-localised, γ-ear containing, ADP ribosylation factor-binding) are {{a family}} of clathrin {{adaptors}} that sort a number of biologically important transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles. Knockout and knockdown studies to determine GGA function are confounded {{by the fact that}} there are 3 GGA genes in mammalian cells. Thus Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system to study tissue expression profiles and knockdown phenotypes as there is a single GGA ortholog. Results Here we have quantified protein expression in Drosophila and show that there is > 3 -fold higher expression of GGA in male flies relative to female flies. In female flies the majority of GGA expression is in the head. In male flies GGA is not only expressed at high levels in the head but there is a <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> increased <b>expression</b> which is due to the abundant expression of GGA in the testes. Using a highly specific antibody we have localised endogenous GGA protein in testes squashes, and visualised it in somatic and germ line cells. We show that GGA is expressed during multiple stages of sperm development, and co-stains with a marker of the trans-Golgi Network. This is most striking at the acroblast of early spermatids. In spite of the high expression of GGA in testes, knocking down its expression by > 95 % using transgenic RNAi fly lines did not affect male fertility. Therefore spermatogenesis in the male flies appears to progress normally with Conclusion In Drosophila we have uncovered a potential role for GGA in the testes of male flies. The <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> higher <b>expression</b> of GGA, its specific enrichment in testes and its localisation to developing spermatocytes and at the acroblast of spermatids supports a role for GGA function in Drosophila spermatogenesis, even though spermatogenesis still occurs when GGA expression is depleted to < 5 % of control. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent {{inflammatory}} mediators {{implicated in}} the pathogenesis of asthma. Human cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR 1) gene contains five exons that are variably spliced. Within its promoter few polymorphisms were described. To date, {{there has been no}} evidence about the expression of different splice variants of CysLT 1 in asthma and their association with CYSLTR 1 promoter polymorphisms. The goal of our study was to investigate CysLT 1 alternative transcripts expression in asthmatic patients with different CYSLTR 1 promoter haplotypes. The study groups consisted of 44 patients with asthma, diagnosed according to GINA 2008 criteria and 18 healthy subjects. Genomic DNA and total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Real-time PCR was performed with specific primers for transcript I [GenBank: DQ 131799] and II [GenBank: DQ 131800]. Fragments of the CYSLTR 1 promoter were amplified by PCR and sequenced directly to identify four single nucleotide polymorphisms: C/T [SNP:rs 321029], A/C [SNP:rs 2637204], A/G [SNP:rs 2806489] and C/T [SNP:rs 7066737]. Results The expression of CysLT 1 transcript I and II in asthma did not differ from its expression in healthy control group. However, in major alleles homozygotic CAAC/CAAC women with asthma we found significantly higher expression of transcript I as compared to heterozygous CAAC/TCGC women in that loci. CysLT 1 transcript I expression tended to negative correlation with episodes of acute respiratory infection in our asthmatic population. Moreover, expression of CysLT 1 transcript II in CAAC/CAAC homozygotic women with asthma was significantly lower than in CAAC/CAAC healthy control females. Conclusions Genetic variants of CYSLTR 1 promoter might be associated with <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> <b>expression</b> of CysLT 1 alternative transcripts in patients with asthma. CysLT 1 splice variants expression might also correlate with the susceptibility to infection in asthmatic population. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{phenomenon}} of sexual reproduction characterizes nearly all eukaryotes, with anisogamy {{being the most}} prevalent form of gamete discrimination. Since dimorphic gametes most likely descend from equal-sized specialized germ cells, identifying the genetic bases of the early functional diversification in isogametes can provide {{better understanding of the}} evolution of sexual dimorphism. However, despite the potential importance to the evolutionary biology field, no comprehensive survey of the transcriptome profiling in isomorphic gametes has been reported hitherto. Results: Gamete differentiation on the genomic level was investigated using Ectocarpus siliculosus, a model organism for brown algal lineage which displays an isogamous sexual reproduction cycle. Transcriptome libraries of male and female gametes were generated using Next Generation Sequencing technology (SOLiD) and analyzed to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways with potential roles in fertilization and gamete specialization. Gamete transcriptomes showed a high level of complexity with a large portion of <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> gene <b>expression.</b> Our results indicate that over 4, 000 of expressed genes are differentially regulated between male and female, including sequences related to cell movement, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, signaling, transport and RNA processing. Conclusions: This first comprehensive transcriptomic study of protist isogametes describes considerable adaptation to distinct sexual roles, suggesting that functional anisogamy precedes morphological differentiation. Several sex-biased genes and pathways with a putative role in reproduction were identified, providing the basis for more detailed investigations of the mechanisms underlying evolution of mating types and sexual dimorphism...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) My thesis {{comprises}} of two {{individual projects}} which {{revolve around the}} importance of post-transcriptional regulation in liver. My first project is studying the integrated miRNA – mRNA network in NAFLD. For fulfillment of the study we conducted a genome-wide study to identify microRNAs (miRs) {{as well as the}} miR-mRNA regulatory network associated with hepatic fat and NAFLD. Hepatic fat content (HFC), miR and mRNA expression were assessed in 73 human liver samples. Liver histology of 49 samples was further characterized into normal (n= 33) and NAFLD (n= 16). Liver miRNome and transcriptome were significantly associated with HFC and utilized to (a) build miR-mRNA association networks in NAFLD and normal livers separately based on the potential miR-mRNA targeting and (b) conduct pathway enrichment analyses. We identified 62 miRs significantly correlated with HFC (p < 0. 05 with q < 0. 15), with miR- 518 b and miR- 19 b being most positively and negatively correlated with HFC, respectively (p < 0. 008 for both). Integrated network analysis showed that six miRs (miRs- 30 b*, 612, 17 *, 129 - 5 p, 204 and 20 a) controlled ~ 70 % of 151 HFC-associated mRNAs (p < 0. 001 with q < 0. 005). Pathway analyses of these HFC-associated mRNA revealed their key effect (p< 0. 05) in inflammation pathways and lipid metabolism. Further, significant (p< 2. 47 e- 4, Wilcoxon test) reduction in degree of negative associations for HFC-associated miRs with HFC-associated mRNAs was observed in NAFLD as compared to normal livers, strongly suggesting highly dysfunctional miR-mRNA post-transcriptional regulatory network in NAFLD. Our study makes several novel observations which provide clues to better understand the pathogenesis and potential treatment targets of NAFLD. My second project is based on uncovering important players of post-transcriptional regulation (RBPs) and how they are associated with age and gender during healthy liver development. For this study, we performed an association analysis focusing on the expression changes of 1344 RNA Binding proteins (RBPs) as a function of age and gender in human liver. We identify 88 and 45 RBPs to be significantly associated with age and gender respectively. Experimental verification of several of the predicted associations in the mouse model confirmed our findings. Our results suggest that {{a small fraction of the}} gender-associated RBPs (~ 40 %) are likely to be up-regulated in males. Altogether, these observations show that several of these RBPs are important developmentally conserved regulators. Further analysis of the protein interaction network of RBPs associated with age and gender based on the centrality measures like degree, betweenness and closeness revealed that several of these RBPs might be prominent players in liver development and impart <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> alterations in gene expression via the formation of protein complexes.

The primary aim of the present study is to evaluate post TKA total range of motion (ROM) among a group of patients who received a <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> high-flexion design modification implant compared to a control group of patients who received non-gender specific implants. Methods and results The control group was comprised of 39 TKAs that were recruited pre-operatively and received the non-gender specific implant while the study group consisted of 39 TKAs who received <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> implants. The study group yielded an improvement in mean post-operative ROM of 21 ° at 12 months, whereas the mean improvement in ROM among the control group was 11 °. Thus, the study group had a 10 ° increased ROM improvement (91 %) over the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 00060). In addition, 100 % of the subjects with <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> high-flexion implants achieved greater or equal ROM post-operatively compared to 82 % for the control cohort.

40|$|This study investigates if and how LEGO {{is making}} <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> brands, {{how they are}} {{conceived}} by children and which relevance <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> toys can have for the kids' interaktion and gender identity. The {{first part of the}} empiricism is based on the two <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> brands; LEGO Friends and LEGO Ninjago. The second part of the empiricism is ethnographic and consists of six interviews with children (age 5 - 7) and their parents. The first part of the analysis is a semiotic analysis of the two chosen brands, which consists of a trans media analysis, a narrative analysis and a gender analysis. The trans media analysis of the two brands is based on Anja Bechmann Petersen's theories and concludes that they are operating inseparably on different media platforms. The brands are bound together of each their own aesthetic and storytelling, which is analysed in the light of narrative theory by Annemette Hejlsted. This concludes that the two brands are based on a specific narrative structure and unique characters, which becomes <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> through the aesthetic elements. The analysis of the interviews, which is {{the second part of the}} analysis, focusses on how mainly the children conceives and interacts with the two different brands by focussing on trans media, storytelling, play and gender identity. The analysis concludes that the children are very conscious of the brands as either boy or girl appealing. The way the children interacts with and play within the two brands are therefore <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> as well and can be seen in their interest in and knowledge of the two brands. In continuation of the analysis this paper discusses the relevance and significance of <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> toys regarding the children. The discussion will contain the two conflicting conceptions of gender; a biologic explanation and a sociocultural explanation. The biologic conception will mainly be based on theories from Gideon Zlotnik and Ann-Elisabeth Knudsen, who argues that being <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> becomes a reality because boys and girls are biological different. The sociocultural conception will mainly be based on theories of Judith Butler and Pierre Bourdieu, who argues that when something is <b>gender</b> <b>specific</b> it reflect social and kulturel constructions.
