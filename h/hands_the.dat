5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then <b>hands</b> <b>the</b> ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E

Mega Man & Bass lets the player choose between either of its title characters, each of which plays differently from the other.|$|E

5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her <b>hands.</b> <b>The</b> attack automatically targets enemies in range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted.

The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by his doctors {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other <b>hands.</b> <b>The</b> outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E
5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare <b>hands.</b> <b>The</b> Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E

5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles.

Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet <b>hands,</b> <b>the</b> Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential.
