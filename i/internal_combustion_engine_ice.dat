5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> (<b>ICE)</b> vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

Hothouse gas emission of the cars equipped with <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> (<b>ICE</b> – for instance gasoline or Diesel engine) brings ecological problems namely in big cities. Development of alternative car drives, based on electric energy stored in battery, offers solution only for vehicles covering short distances unfortunately.

25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> (<b>ICE)</b> motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles. These include both four-stroke and two-stroke gasoline engine designs. Among these, Golden Eagle Bike Engines currently produces a rear-engine (rack-mounted) kit using a belt to drive the rear wheel. Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (friction drive) or a chain-driven, geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke gas engines mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or chain-driven transmissions and final drives. Some of these brands include Jiangdu Flying Horse Gasoline Engine Factory Ltd., EZ Motorbike Company, Inc., Mega Motors Inc., and Grubee Inc.|$|E
25|$|Series hybrids use an <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> (<b>ICE)</b> {{to turn a}} generator, {{which in}} turn {{supplies}} current to an electric motor, which then rotates the vehicle’s drive wheels. A battery or supercapacitor pack, {{or a combination of}} the two, can be used to store excess charge. Examples of series hybrids vehicles include the Chevrolet Volt (first generation), Fisker Karma, Renault Kangoo, Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, Daimler AG's hybrid Orion bus, Opel Flextreme concept car, Swissauto REX VW Polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE. As is the case for other architectures, series hybrids can operate without recharging {{as long as there is}} liquid fuel in the tank.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{motorized}} bicycle or motorbike {{can be traced back}} to the latter part of the 19th century when experimenters began attaching steam engines to stock tricycles and quadracycles. The first true motorized bicycle is generally considered to be the French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede of 1868. The Michaux-Perreaux was followed by the American Roper steam velocipede of 1869, built by Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts. Roper demonstrated his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern United States in 1867, and built a total of 10 examples. These early attempts at propelling a bicycle by means other than the human body were not successful, either practically or commercially. It was not until the 1890s, with the advent of the gasoline-powered <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> (<b>ICE),</b> that the motorized bicycle could be considered a practical machine.|$|E

The Downsizing of <b>internal</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> (<b>ICE)</b> is al-ready recognized as a very suitable method for the concurrent enhancement of the indicated fuel conversion efficiency (IFCE) and lowering of the CO 2 and NOx emissions [1], [2].

The Ultra-Downsizing will be implemented here by means of real Atkinson cycles, using asymmetrical crank mechanisms, combined with a very inten-sive multistage high-pressure turbocharging with intensive intercooling. This will allow an increase of ICE performance while keeping the thermal and mechanical strain strength of engine components within the current usual limits.
