5|$|The {{widespread}} <b>fluke</b> Prosthogonimus ovatus, which {{lives in}} the oviducts of birds, has been recorded in the corn crake, as have the parasitic worm Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even suppose it, except by a <b>fluke.</b>|$|E
5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may sometimes be seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the <b>fluke</b> Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E

50|$|Wasteneys Smith's anchor is {{composed}} of three main parts, the shank and crown which form one forging, and the two <b>flukes</b> or arms which are separate castings. A bolt passes through the crown of the anchor, connecting the <b>flukes</b> to it; to prevent the <b>flukes</b> working off the connecting through bolt, two smaller bolts pass though the <b>flukes</b> {{at right angles to}} the through bolt and are recessed half their diameter into it.|$|R
40|$|Although {{notorious for}} {{clogging}} pumping stations, eroding levees and stealing bait, the Chinese mitten crab poses a perhaps equally significant, albeit less recognized, human health threat as a host {{for a group}} of parasites known as lung <b>flukes.</b> <b>Flukes,</b> which come in Asian and North American varieties, can be acquired by eating uncooked or under-cooked infected mitten crabs. People infected with <b>flukes</b> may develop tuberculosis-like symptoms, resulting in permanent lung damage. <b>Flukes</b> can also track into the brain...|$|R
5|$|Fast and active, {{the copper}} shark may be {{encountered}} alone, in pairs, or in loosely organized schools containing up {{to hundreds of}} individuals. Some aggregations seem to form for reproductive purposes, while others form in response to concentrations of food. This species may fall prey to larger sharks and killer whales. Known parasites of the copper shark include the tapeworms Cathetocephalus australis, Dasyrhynchus pacificus and D. talismani, Floriceps minacanthus, Phoreiobothrium robertsoni, and Pseudogrillotia spratti, the leech Stibarobdella macrothela, and the <b>fluke</b> Otodistomum veliporum.|$|E
5|$|Sedna's highly {{elliptical}} orbit means that the probability of its detection was roughly 1 in 80, which suggests that, unless its discovery was a <b>fluke,</b> another 40–120 Sedna-sized objects would exist within the same region. Another object, , has a similar but less extreme orbit: it has a perihelion of 44.3AU, an aphelion of 394 AU, and an orbital period of 3,240 years. It may {{have been affected by}} the same processes as Sedna.|$|E
5|$|The Huskies entered 2008 {{seeking to}} prove their success the {{previous}} season was no <b>fluke.</b> In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, West Virginia, 66–21. A loss to Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9–4. In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of infection in definitive host {{is divided into}} two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the biliary phase. The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile <b>flukes</b> penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, <b>flukes</b> migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. F. hepatica has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver. Occasionally, ectopic locations of <b>flukes</b> such as the lungs, diaphragm, intestinal wall, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue can occur. During the migration of <b>flukes,</b> tissues are mechanically destroyed and inflammation appears around migratory tracks of <b>flukes.</b> The second phase (the biliary phase) begins when parasites enter the biliary ducts of the liver. In biliary ducts, <b>flukes</b> mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. Hypertrophy of biliar ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.|$|R
50|$|Blue marlin {{have many}} parasites, {{including}} from these groups: Digenea (<b>flukes),</b> Didymozoidea (tissue <b>flukes),</b> Monogenea (gillworms), Cestoda (tapeworms), Nematoda (roundworms), Acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms), copepods, barnacles, and cookiecutter sharks.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Cultured {{fish are}} {{commonly}} afflicted by disease caused by monogenean <b>flukes,</b> resulting in significant production losses. In vitro trials {{were conducted to}} identify an effective treatment against the monogenean <b>flukes</b> Calceostoma sp. and Diplectanum sp. infecting the silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus. Treatments included praziquantel, formalin, freshwater. hydrogen peroxide and copper sulphate. Freshwater {{was found to be}} 100 % effective on both species of <b>flukes,</b> whereas praziquantel was more effective at a higher concentration. The other treatments were not effective against the <b>flukes</b> and are not recommended for use...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the copepod Trebius latifurcatus, the <b>fluke</b> Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread <b>fluke</b> Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the parasitic worm Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a <b>fluke</b> {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
50|$|Paramphistomiasis causes {{enteritis}} and anaemia in livestocks {{mammals and}} result in substantial production and economic losses. Pathological symptoms are produced by immature <b>flukes.</b> When the young <b>flukes</b> start to gather in the intestine, there is a watery and fetid diarrhoea which {{is often associated with}} high mortality (even up to 80-90%) in ruminants. At a given time, as many as 30,000 <b>flukes</b> may accumulate, fervently attacking the duodenal mucosa to induce acute enteritis. Adult <b>flukes</b> are relatively harmless. Liver tissue are generally damaged extensively, indicated by swelling, haemorrhage, discolouration, necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, and fibrosis.|$|R
5000|$|Large darters are {{susceptible}} to internal parasitism by <b>flukes</b> and nematodes. [...] External parasites such as black spot disease caused by Metacercariae <b>flukes</b> and piscicolid leeches also affect snubnose darters.|$|R
25|$|Echinostoma are {{not highly}} pathogenic. Symptoms of greater {{severity}} {{tend to be}} seen in an echinostomiasis infection where there is a higher number of <b>flukes.</b> The <b>flukes</b> cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, which leads to ulceration and inflammation.|$|R
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting <b>fluke</b> of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|Barn owls are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the <b>fluke</b> Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursae of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller dragonfly larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. Dragonfly nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or <b>fluke</b> stage of the trematode.|$|E
50|$|Paropecoelus is a genus of <b>flukes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Aberrant {{hosts of}} F. magna are sheep and goats. However, {{the course of}} {{infection}} is similar in guinea pigs, rabbits, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) that were infected experimentally. Infections in aberrant hosts are characterized by excessive wandering of juvenile <b>flukes</b> and death of the host. Aberrant hosts die usually within 6 months post-infection and the death is associated with acute peritonitis or extensive haemorrhage caused by migrating <b>flukes.</b> In aberrant hosts, <b>flukes</b> do not mature and migrate until the host dies. Occasionally, a few <b>flukes</b> mature and eggs {{can be found in}} the faeces. Hepatic lesions in aberrant hosts generally include firm adhesions of the liver to the diaphragm, black pigmentation, hematomas, necroses, and haemorrhagic tracts in which juvenile <b>flukes</b> are located. While a lack of fibrous capsules within hepatic parenchyma has been reported by several authors, <b>flukes</b> in fibrous capsules have also been documented in sheep. However, the wall of the capsule is different from those found in cervids and large bovids. The dominant feature is a diffuse fibrosis throughout the liver and haemorrhagic migratory tracts containing erythrocytes, black pigment, and cell detritus. The liver lesions are infiltrated by eosinophils, plasma cells, and pigment-laden macrophages.|$|R

5|$|In Iran, some golden jackals carry {{intestinal}} worms (helminths) and Echinococcus granulosus. In Israel, some jackals carry intestinal helminths and Leishmania tropica infection. In Romania, a jackal {{was found}} to be carrying Trichinella britovi. In northeastern Italy, the jackal is a carrier of the tick species Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus, and the smallest human <b>fluke</b> Metagonimus yokogawai that can be caught from ingesting infected raw fish, which can lead to metagonimiasis. In Hungary, some jackals carry dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis, and some have provided the first record in Hungary of Trichinella spiralis and the first record in Europe of Echinococcus multilocularis. The jackal is dispersing across Europe through rivers and valleys, bringing parasites into regions where these did not previously exist.|$|E
5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites. VentureBeat noted that, while comparable with other similar campaigns, Operation Rainfall was notable for maintaining civility during its efforts. Zach Kaplan of Nintendo Life said that the campaign {{needed to make a}} clear mark, showing that the success of the then-announced Xenoblade Chronicles was not a <b>fluke.</b> In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly unremarkable Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the announcement of a North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a <b>fluke</b> accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|Microphallidae is {{a family}} of trematodes (<b>flukes).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of M. piriformes {{requires}} two hosts: the rough periwinkle Littorina saxatilis (a littoral snail) and the herring gull Larus argentatus (and perhaps {{other members of the}} herring gull complex). The immature <b>flukes</b> live in the snail, and the adult <b>flukes</b> live in the bird.|$|R
50|$|Another {{class of}} {{waterborne}} metazoan pathogens are certain {{members of the}} Schistosomatidae, a family of blood <b>flukes.</b> They usually infect victims that make skin contact with the water. Blood <b>flukes</b> are pathogens that cause Schistosomiasis of various forms, more or less seriously affecting {{hundreds of millions of}} people worldwide.|$|R
5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail <b>fluke.</b> In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} forms shoals or schools {{that tend to}} be larger during the winter and spring. Though fairly active, its {{swimming}} muscles exhibit lower activity of glycolytic enzymes and higher activity of creatine phosphokinase compared to the shallow-water spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), suggesting a lesser capacity for bursts of speed. The lipid-filled liver comprises about one-fifth of its total weight and functions in maintaining neutral buoyancy. Potential predators of the black dogfish are larger sharks and bony fishes. It {{is one of several}} deep-sea sharks parasitized by the barnacle Anelasma squalicola, which attaches in front of the second dorsal fin and impairs the reproductive development of its host. Other known parasites of this species include the <b>fluke</b> Otodistomum cestoides, the copepods Neoalbionella fabricii and Neoalbionella centroscyllii, and the protozoans Haemogregarina delagei and Trypanosoma rajae.|$|E
5|$|When swimming, baleen whales rely {{on their}} {{flippers}} for locomotion in a wing-like manner similar to penguins and sea turtles. Flipper movement is continuous. While doing this, baleen whales use their tail <b>fluke</b> to propel themselves forward through vertical motion while using their flippers for steering, much like an otter. Some species leap out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Because of their great size, right whales are not flexible or agile like dolphins, and none can move their neck because of the fused cervical vertebrae; this sacrifices speed for stability in the water. The hind legs are enclosed inside the body, and {{are thought to be}} vestigial organs. However, a 2014 study suggests that the pelvic bone serves as support for whale genitalia.|$|E
50|$|Paramphistomiasis causes {{enteritis}} and anaemia in livestocks {{mammals and}} result in substantial production and economic losses. Adults attach to the villi in the rumens of the hosts and sap nutrients from the intestine, although they can wander into the bile and pancreatic ducts, as do other trematodes. Pathological symptoms are produced by immature <b>flukes.</b> When the young <b>flukes</b> start to gather in the intestine, there is a watery and fetid diarrhoea which {{is often associated with}} high mortality (even up to 80-90%) in ruminants. At a given time, as many as 30,000 <b>flukes</b> may accumulate, fervently attacking the duodenal mucosa to induce acute enteritis. Surprisingly, the adult <b>flukes</b> are regarded as commensals and non-pathogenic. However, they do cause the intestinal villi to erode and instil inflammation. Liver tissue are generally damaged extensively, indicated by swelling, haemorrhage, discolouration, necrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, and fibrosis. Paramphistomiasis is responsible for severe economic losses to milk, meat and wool production since the <b>flukes</b> take nutrients from their hosts, which leads to weight loss and physiological decline.|$|R
50|$|Fasciolidae is {{a family}} of trematodes and {{includes}} several veterinary and medical important parasites. Family Fasciolidae is divided into 5 genera. <b>Flukes</b> of the family are localized in liver, gall bladder, and the intestine. The life cycle of fasciolid <b>flukes</b> includes one intermediate host - freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae.|$|R
50|$|One {{should also}} be aware that pond-reared red {{ramshorn}} snails are able to carry various parasitic <b>flukes,</b> which can be transmitted to fish, or humans. Most of these <b>flukes</b> require intermediate hosts, so that leaving the snails in a fish-free aquarium {{for a month or}} so will eliminate any parasites.|$|R
