The first model presented in the IVL is the ‘Laissez-faire’ model, which doesn’t indicate any changes which should be implemented in order to change the spatial development in Luxembourg. The second possibility reveals a model which concentrates only on Luxembourg-city. Another model follows the ‘Main traffic axes’ scenario, which indicates a higher urban settlement in the future around the main traffic axes and next to good public transport connections. Another model is the so-called ‘Tripol’, which focuses the concentration of working and <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> on the three main urban areas in Luxembourg: Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg-city and the Nordstad. The last model is the ‘Region centers’ model, {{which is based on}} a number of municipalities that should increase their population and attractiveness in order to represent urban centers for the several regions of Luxembourg.|$|E
50|$|The 1954 plan {{introduced}} a residential zoning regime for Melbourne which classified inner urban houses through to fringe development and their density.

The 1970s also saw renewed interest in the <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> of inner Melbourne suburbs. The 1981 plan emphasised this trend proposing redevelopment of old inner industrial sites. The city of Melbourne introduced ‘postcode 3000’ in 1992 as an incentive to live in Melbourne’s city centre, and by the mid-1990s higher density and diversity housing was occurring in inner suburbs and would eventually spread to middle suburbs.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ArchitectureDavid R. SeamonKamaiya is {{a system}} of Nepalese {{agriculture}} bonded labor. In typical wage labor, one can enter or withdraw from the labor market as an independent agent; {{in the case of}} bonded labor, however, a worker cannot control his or her labor power. The Kamaiyas were liberated by the Nepalese government in 2000, and promised land to build houses. Without enough money for construction, however, many of these “ex-Kamaiyas,” as they are now called, are without housing or live in sub-standard units. This thesis examines the <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> for the ex-Kamaiyas and aims at creating basic guidelines for planning and designing low-cost, self-help housing. The thesis is an attempt to design affordable and environmentally responsive housing that draws on Nepalese vernacular traditions but incorporates some modern materials and construction methods. The research and designs are based on interviews with ex-Kamaiyas living in the Nepalese villages of Tesanpur, Janatanagar, and Bhuri Gaun. The thesis serves as a guide for non-profit organizations working to provide housing for the ex-Kamaiyas and consists of guidelines, termed “design patterns,” for laying out ex-Kamaiya neighborhoods and for designing and constructing individual houses.

40|$|The energy {{issue has}} come to be a central part of the debate {{regarding}} the environment and climate changes. Since one third of the total use of energy in Sweden is related to <b>housing,</b> <b>possibilities</b> to save energy in this sector is large. This fact in combination with increased energy prices has made low energy buildings attractive. Building of passive houses, e. g. houses without a conventional heating system, have increased in Sweden. Although, there are still very few passive houses built in the north of Sweden, which may be due to uncertainty concerning the technical possibility and profitability for the clients. In this master thesis the technical and economical feasibility to build passive house in Kiruna are examined with the help of energy analysis and life cycle costs. The experiments are performed with help of the Passive House Planning Package where different alternatives are investigated. The results of the analysis have been cost estimated and compared with expected future energy prices using life cycle cost calculations. The life cycle cost calculations resulted in a variety of scenarios with different results dependent on the selected values of the input parameters. The results are not quite conclusive and the answer of the question if it is profitable to build a passive house in Kiruna is still uncertain. The uncertainties of the results are mainly due to difficulties in predicting energy prices, interest rates and inflation. However, energy savings occur in all scenarios which means that the profitability of the investments are only a matter of time. Validerat; 20120418 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCharged {{particle}} semiconductor detectors {{have been}} used in Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) for over four decades without great changes in either design or fabrication. However one area where improvement is desirable would be to increase the detector solid angle so as to improve spectrum statistics for a given incident beam fluence. This would allow the use of very low fluences opening the way, for example, to increase the time resolution in real-time RBS or for analysis of materials that are highly sensitive to beam damage. In order to achieve this goal without incurring the costs of degraded resolution due to kinematic broadening or large detector capacitance, a single-chip segmented detector (SEGDET) was designed and built within the SPIRIT EU infrastructure project. In this work we present the Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) in the vicinity between two adjacent segments focusing on the interstrip zone. Microbeam Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) measurements with different ion masses and energies were used to perform X-Y mapping of (CCE), as a function of detector operating conditions (bias voltage changes, detector <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> and guard ring configuration). We show the (CCE) in the edge region of the active area and have also mapped the charge from the interstrip region, shared between adjacent segments. The results indicate that the electrical extent of the interstrip region is very close to the physical extent of the interstrip and guard ring structure with interstrip impacts contributing very little to the complete spectrum. The interstrip contributions to the spectra that do occur, can be substantially reduced by an offline anti-coincidence criterion applied to list mode data, which should also be easy to implement directly in the data acquisition software...|$|E
40|$|The Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency is a {{division}} of the City of Albuquerque’s Planning Department. The agency manages rank three plans developed for communities which are designated “slum and blighted” due to unhealthy, unsafe and overall perception of disinvestment in a community (MR Code 3 - 60 A- 2). In June, 2010, the Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency lost nearly all its staff due to retirements and a tight city budget, eight of the 10 employees of the division no longer worked for the city. That same year, four months later in October 2010, a ninth employee also retired, leaving one staff member for the entire division. Nearly, 135 years of experience in redevelopment planning was lost to the City of Albuquerque, and the 20 areas that the agency worked The Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency’s role in to manage an annual budget of nearly $ 10 million and use federal, state and local government monies to fund redevelopment projects indentified in redevelopment plans. The reason why the loss of experienced planning staff is so concerning is because the areas where redevelopment plans are trying to make a difference are areas of the city that have experienced significant neglect, and the private sector is unwilling to overlook the present conditions to reinvest in an older area. The Metropolitan Redevelopment Agency is able to identify catalyst projects in a plan and partner with private developers or non-profit agencies to work on potential projects that revitalize a community. The previous Manager of the Redevelopment Agency, Cynthia Borrego, said that for every $ 1 million dollars of public money invested in the community the agency expected $ 10 million in private dollar expense. This reinvestment makes a real difference to a community and makes a big difference in gross receipts for a municipality. Given this loss of nearly 135 years of combines staff experience in a four-month span, there is an opportunity to examine the agency and how it might try and improve, how it works with communities, and how it develops plans, identifies projects and measures the impact or the effectiveness of projects completed under a plan. By looking at a case study of a designated redevelopment area, East Gateway, I will answer many questions regarding how by improving strategies, changing some of the agency’s policies and planning for the future it can improve how it is doing business. East Gateway is trying to develop a plan for the area on East Central Avenue. The community is having to be educated on what tools can be used to address the conditions on East Central, and I will compare other similar redevelopment areas that have experienced similar conditions. The tools they used to achieve their outcomes also will be identified. These similar redevelopment areas have been shown to have stimulated economic growth, improved <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> and overall strengthened their communities...|$|E
40|$|Financial Risk, HomeownerHomeownership: {{the sacred}} cow of U. S. housing policy September 04, 2007 |By John Rennie Short As we pick through the debris {{caused by the}} {{subprime}} lending fiasco, it is pertinent to ask how we got into this mess. Dodgy lending practices, unreliable risk assessment, sheer greed and other dubious financial practices all played their part. But {{at the heart of}} the matter is the shibboleth that homeownership is the only housing policy worth pursuing. Federal policies now make the alternatives to homeownership very unattractive. Public housing has disappeared for all but the very poor, and private renters get no tax breaks. In contrast, owner-occupiers get tax relief on mortgage interest repayments and capital gains from the sale of their homes up to half a million dollars. In 2006, these two subsidies cost $ 112 billion in tax expenditures, and they are estimated to rise to $ 174 billion by 2010. These are among the most regressive subsidies, aiding the wealthy and middle class more than lower-income households. There are also personal benefits to homeownership. But these have been exaggerated by an aggressive and self-serving lobby of house builders, real estate agents and financiers. Most gains go to those with higher incomes. For people on more modest incomes, homeownership can be a very mixed blessing. For one thing, their finances are severely stretched by mortgage repayments - as well as maintenance and repair costs that tend to be a higher proportion of total value for older, lower-priced homes. And prices are more likely to fall or stagnate in lower-income areas; witness the devaluation of many inner-city neighborhoods passed over by the recent housing boom. Many of the suburbs built between 1945 and 1980 experienced a crisis of falling prices, declining population and rising fiscal stress even before the subprime meltdown. Suburban counties such as Worcester in Massachusetts and Lackawanna in Pennsylvania, as well as small suburban districts such as Forest Park close to Atlanta, saw marked declines. The poverty rate in Forest Park, for example, doubled from 1980 to 2000. The new metropolitan crisis is in the inner-ring suburbs. The homeownership rate, 55 percent in 1950, rose and then remained around 63 percent from the 1960 s to mid- 1990 s. Since then, the rate has been pushed to almost 69 percent. Encouraging homeownership beyond around 63 percent, as successive administrations have done, has pushed more households into a precarious financial position. If we have learned anything from the history of government, it is that one policy size does not fit all. Yet that is exactly our housing policy. We need to embrace a diversity of <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Let us level the playing field so that homeowners do not receive such disproportionate benefits by perhaps reducing and even eliminating the numerous tax benefits to owner-occupiers. Although politically difficult to accomplish in property-owning democracies, it is possible. The United Kingdom abolished tax relief on mortgage interest payments in April 2000. Public housing is vanishing, but we can surely think of alternative forms of housing. There is a rich variety of innovative alternatives such as social housing, cooperative housing and others that can provide people with decent accommodation and much less financial risk. It is time that we critically evaluate the costs as well as the touted benefits of promoting homeownership. Over the long haul, the gains are not so impressive as advertised. Middle- and lower-income households are financially stretched by a system geared to benefit the wealthy. For middle-income America, homeownership is the preferred choice because there are no decent alternatives. The single-minded pursuit of homeownership is an assumption taken for granted and shared by both left and right. This sacred cow should be the biggest casualty of the recent mortgage crisis.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} how actors in Norwegian {{municipalities}} cooperate to establish more permanent housing for persons living in various forms of temporary housing shelters. In particular, it focuses on the cooperation between the staff at shelters and local government representatives, to establish housing that is both suits individual needs and satisfies quality criteria. The central actors’ views on the possibilities and barriers related to this work have been important to trace. It was important that the municipalities selected for the study had experienced {{a certain amount of}} homelessness problems among their inhabitants. It was also an important criterion that they should represent different ways of organizing the social housing services. The three largest cities and three medium sized municipalities with a geographical location close to the cities were selected. Three of the municipalities have established a housing company, based on certain business-like principles. All six municipalities have renewed their housing policies and services for the last years, largely through financial support from the central government. The degree of political and administrative anchoring of the services varies between these municipalities, but such anchoring seems to be an important factor to a successful establishment of housing for the disadvantaged. Municipal actors saw possibilities for long-term thinking, better opportunities for coordination and better anchoring of policies and services as important requirements for securing more permanent housing solutions for homeless people. The seven temporary housing shelters being studied represents a variety of organization, size, and central service principals, and their perspectives on the work towards establishing more permanent housing varies as well. In the report, we have classified the housing shelters into four categories: The good shelter, the planning place, the training institution and the house with supporting services. For all of them, the main target groups are people with drug problems and/or mental problems. They have different strategies {{when it comes to the}} establishing of mote permanent housing. Some of them work in lines of what have been labelled a Staircase-model, others base their work on what resembles a so-called Chain-model. «The good shelter» experiences a dilemma between the offering of good services and care to people in a difficult life-situation, and the striving towards securing more permanent housing. In the «Training institution» this kind of dilemmas are being solved through a strong weight on long-term working, tolerance and several chances on the road to coping with ones problems. The challenge they face is to secure the process of moving out into permanent housing through a more smooth coordination with the social services. «The planning place» has both as its principle and mandate to offer a temporary place to live. The main principle of work is to map out the situation of the clients, and to secure them a suitable place to live in cooperation with the local social service offices. As in the «Houses with support», this place have developed competence and principles of their work that is very much in accordance with the ideas now dominating Norwegian social housing services. All the studied housing shelters have important relations to both municipal services, in particular the social services. Some of them also cooperate closely with the state health services and other public services. The social services can be an important driving force in the housing work, but according to the shelter staff these services can also in some cases represent a barrier. The housing of problematic groups of clients in temporary shelters can therefore become permanent. An important finding of this study is that the cooperation between social services and temporary housing shelters is of importance to integrate the new strategies from the social housing work into the temporary housing services. At the same time, it is important to strengthen the focus on housing in the social services, and thus secure an understanding of temporary housing shelters as just that, and not places to put away problematic clients for an undefined period. It is also worth listening to the views of the staff at temporary housing shelters, pointing to the lack of adequate <b>housing</b> <b>possibilities</b> in the municipalities. And the most difficult persons to establish good housing for, is the people with the largest and most complex needs...|$|E
