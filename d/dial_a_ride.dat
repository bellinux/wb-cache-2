5|$|The Everett Station complex also {{includes}} a bus station with 26 bus bays that serve as a major transfer station for routes from Snohomish County. Everett Transit operates {{the majority of its}} bus routes out of their 12 bus bays on Smith Avenue. Community Transit has six routes at the station, serving as the terminus for local service from Smokey Point, Marysville, Snohomish, Lake Stevens, and Monroe; CT also debuted their Swift bus rapid transit service in 2009, with Everett Station as the northern terminus of the route along the Highway 99 corridor to Shoreline. Sound Transit runs three of its ST Express bus routes out of Everett Station, with peak-only, limited-stop service to Seattle and Bellevue, as well as all-day service to Seattle via Lynnwood Transit Center, along Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Skagit Transit runs a weekday inter-county express route (Route 90X) from the station to the Skagit Transportation Center in Mount Vernon and Chuckanut Park & Ride in Burlington; Island Transit also runs a peak-only weekday express route (Route 412C) from Everett Station to Stanwood and Camano Island. Paratransit to {{the front door of the}} station building is provided by Community Transit and Everett Station through the <b>Dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ride</b> program.|$|E
25|$|Buses now {{provide the}} {{majority}} of local public transport. The main bus operators are First Southampton, Bluestar, Xelabus and Wheelers. The other large service provider is the Unilink bus service (running from {{early in the morning}} to midnight), which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town. Previously run by Enterprise, it is now run by Bluestar. Free buses were provided by City-link', but the subsidy provided by Southampton City Council was pulled in 2014 and the service now charges passengers £1 flat-rate single fare, with Red Funnel ticket holders continuing to travel free. The service was rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016, with a red and white livery on the bus instead of blue. It runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminals at Town Quay to Central station via Westquay and is operated by Bluestar. There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton <b>Dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ride,</b> for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.|$|E

But the backseat is sealed off and rigged with cyanide gas, killing Chandless. Dial is with his lover, Francine Ley, and urging her to ditch her boyfriend. He mentions a scam Chandless played on a mobster named Zapparty. Francine’s boyfriend, Johnny De Ruse, comes home and Dial leaves. De Ruse {{is aware of the}} affair, and tells Francine he is leaving town, due to his giving evidence against Mops Parisi, a dangerous mobster. He gets kidnapped by the same rigged car, but manages to escape and kill the driver. He traces the plot to Zapparty and goes to his club to confront him. Parisi is there too, and he dies in the ensuing gunfight and Zapparty is captured. He admits the gas car was his way of getting revenge, but Parisi carried it out and blackmailed him over it. De Ruse returns to Chandless’s apartment and finds Dial, who is the one who sold out Chandless and De Ruse. He is about to skip town with Chandless’s girlfriend and money, but a security guard kills him and wounds her. De Ruse forgives Francine and takes her back.|$|R

We consider the multi-vehicle <b>Dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> problem, with each vehicle having capacity k and its own depot-vertex, where the objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan) of the vehicles. We study the "preemptive" version of the problem, where an object may be left at intermediate vertices and transported by more than one vehicle, while being moved from source to destination. Our main results are an O(log^ 3 n) -approximation algorithm for preemptive multi-vehicle <b>Dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride,</b> and an improved O(log t) -approximation for its special case when there is no capacity constraint. We also show that the approximation ratios improve by a log-factor when the underlying metric is induced by a fixed-minor-free graph. Comment: 22 pages, 1 figure.

It is characterized by a set of transport demands and a number of vehicles available. The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to displacement optimized individually and collectively. The DRP is classified as NP-hard problem which is why most research has been concentrated on the use of approximate methods to solve it. Indeed, it is a multi-criteria problem, the proposed solution of which aims to reduce both route duration, and cost in response to a certain quality of service provided. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and solving the DRP in the application using the simulated annealing algorithm.

It is modeled as a <b>Dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>Ride</b> Problem (DARP), where several people share the same destination. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the objective function in order to consider several potentially conflicting interests. We propose a multi-criteria model from multi-attribute utility theory based on the Choquet integral. The DARP is then solved with an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm. This method includes classical destroy and repair heuristics as well as new operators exploiting the common delivery nodes aspect, as well as criterion-specic operators. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of 14 real life instances with up to 200 requests and 51 destination points...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOrganizations of pre-hospital {{emergency}} medical services have as first mission to provide medical assistance to patients including transport to medical centers if necessary, and a second one that concerns the transfers of patients from one medical facility to another one. Most organizations in Canada and in North-America use two independent fleets to perform these missions. Although operating two separated fleets seems easier to do, {{it appears to be}} less efficient than an integrated fleet management approach able to deal with both types of demands. Taking this into consideration, this paper aims to design and evaluate the performance of three management approaches. This is a very challenging problem, since it involves solving simultaneously two difficult vehicle routing problems: an ambulance relocation problem and a <b>dial</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> problem...|$|E
