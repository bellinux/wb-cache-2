5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives <b>diffused</b> <b>light</b> through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E

[...] Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, Experiencing Music Video that the <b>diffused</b> <b>light</b> around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards. In the book The 1980s, authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its [...] "exploitation" [...] of the male body and sexualizing them {{as an object of}} desire. The authors also added that the video [...] "was a colorful homage to the term gaze, but Madonna is the bearer of it—not men." [...] Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. [...] "She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song", Stoddart concluded. Elizabeth Edwards, {{one of the authors of}} Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader, explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by [...] "watching herself". She concluded by saying, [...] "'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons—male and female—and a whole new level of irony." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of On Fashion, deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video [...] "is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Photosynthetically active solar {{radiation}} {{can be either}} direct or diffuse. Due to atmospheric scattering, {{solar radiation}} is never fully direct. Under heavy overcast conditions however, it can be fully diffuse. Screens and glass that transform direct <b>light</b> into <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> are used {{under the assumption that}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is more evenly distributed over the canopy, increasing crop photosynthesis rate. The Intkam crop growth model computes leaf photosynthesis rate in 5 leaf layers, for the sunlit and shaded leaf area and for the leaf areas receiving direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> It integrates instantaneous leaf photosynthesis rates to the crop photosynthesis rate. Instantaneous canopy photosynthesis is used to compute the seasonal growth of organs. This process approach enables a detailed analysis of the effects of variations in natural light. An analytical comparison was made between 100 % direct and 100 % <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> for a representative day in winter (day 24) and in summer (day 202). Sunlit leaf area is illuminated by both direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> whereas a shaded leaf area is illuminated by <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> only. These components vary within and among leaf layers, and were all quantified. On both days, a higher instantaneous crop photosynthesis was computed under fully <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> than under fully direct light. This difference is caused by the more homogeneous distribution of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> than direct light at a certain canopy depth, in combination with a declining response to increasing light intensities of the photosynthesis rate. Experiments with three types of diffuse glass and a whitewash were conducted in 2011. Light scattering of the glass (haze) varied from 45 - 71 %, with at least the same transmission as the reference. Tomato production under diffuse glass was increased by 8 - 11 % in early June, and was maintained to November. The Intkam model simulated approximately the same relative seasonal production increases under diffuse glass...|$|R
40|$|We {{search for}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> {{in the galaxy}} group HCG 44 in order to {{determine}} its luminosity and luminosity fraction. Combining with literature data, we aim to constrain the dynamical status of Hickson compact groups. We use Intra Group planetary nebulae (IGPNe) as tracers of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> These are detected by the so-called on band-off band technique. We found 12 emission line objects in HCG 44, none of them associated with the galaxies of the group. The absence of PNe in the elliptical galaxy, NGC 3193, implies that this galaxy is located behind the group, leaving only three spiral galaxy members in HCG 44. 6 / 12 emission line objects are consistent with being IGPNe in HCG 44, but are also consistent with being Lyα background galaxies. Thus we derive an upper limit to the <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fraction in HCG 44 of 4. 7 %, corresponding to 1. 06 × 10 9 L⊙,B and mean surface brightness ofµB = 30. 04 mag arcsec − 2. We find a correlation between the fraction of elliptical galaxies and the amount of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> in Hickson compact groups. Those with large fraction of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> are those with large fractions in number and luminosity of E/S 0 galaxies.

2500|$|The {{functions}} of the temple mainly concentrated on the cella, the [...] "dwelling" [...] of the cult statue. The elaboration of the temple's external aspects served to stress {{the dignity of the}} cella. In contrast, the cella itself was often finished with some moderation. The only source of light for cella and cult statue was the cellas frontal door. Thus, the interior only received a limited amount of light. Exceptions are found in the temples of Apollo at Bassae and of Athena at Tegea, where the southern cella wall had a door, potentially allowing more light into the interior. A special situation applies to the temples of the Cyclades, where the roof was usually of marble tiles. Marble roofs also covered the temple of Zeus at Olympia and the Parthenon at Athens. As marble is not entirely opaque, those cellas may have been permeated with a distinctive <b>diffused</b> <b>light.</b> For cultic reasons, but also to use the light of the rising sun, virtually all Greek temples were oriented to the east. Some exceptions existed, e.g. the west-facing temples of Artemis at Ephesos and at Magnesia on the Maeander, or the north-south oriented temples of Arcadia. Such exceptions are probably connected with cult practice. Study of the soils around temple sites, is evidence that temple sites were chosen with regard to particular deities: for example, amid arable soils for the agricultural deities Dionysos and Demeter, and near rocky soils for the hunter gatherer deities Apollo and Artemis.|$|E

40|$|The light {{environment}} of plants is extremely complex and questions relating to how direct, <b>diffuse,</b> or low-angle <b>light</b> affect plants at the leaf-level have remained largely unanswered. Global-change scenarios suggest a trend of increasing <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> due to expected increases in cloud cover and atmospheric water vapor concentrations. Here we present three different examples where {{changes in the}} directional quality of light affect leaf-level processes. First, some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which {{have been shown to}} focus collimated light, but their optical function under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> has been largely speculative. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat and lens-shaped epidermal cells. Regardless of epidermal cell shape, direct light was absorbed more than <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> in all species studied by approximately 2 – 3 %. These data suggest that lensshaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> and palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape. Second, community-level productivity has been shown to increase under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> conditions and has been attributed to more uniform distribution of light within the forest canopy. Leaf-level responses to the directional quality of light, however, are unknown. Here we show that leaf-level photosynthesis in sun leaves of both C 3 and C 4 plants can be 10 – 15 % higher under direct light compared to equivalent absorbed irradiances of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> while shade-adapted leaves showed no preference for direct or <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> at any irradiance. Sun leaves with multiple palisade layers may be adapted to better utilize direct than <b>diffuse</b> <b>light,</b> while shade leaf structure does not appear to discriminate light based on its directionality. Thus, it appears that leaf-level and canopy-level photosynthetic processes react differently to the directionality of light, and previously observed increases in canopy-level photosynthesis occur even though leaf-level photosynthesis decreases under <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> Third, we tested how changes in the directional quality of light affect the penetration of light at the leaf-level. Using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging we were able to determine that low-angle and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> do not penetrate as deeply into leaves as direct light. Upon entering the leaf, <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> appears to scatter and remain in the upper tissue layers, while direct light penetrates through more leaf tissue. Absorption of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> is reduced compared to direct light, with the greatest differences in absorption occurring near the interface of the palisade and spongy mesophyll tissue. Changes in the directional quality of light can therefore alter the absorption of light at the leaf-level, and a shift in the absorption profile could potentially decrease light utilization, potentially contributing to the leaf-level photosynthetic differences observed. Overall, {{it is now clear that}} plants are much more sensitive to the directional quality of light than we once believed. Also, the directional quality of light has different effects when scaling from the leaf to the landscape, and models of both leaf-level and community-level photosynthesis should be revised to account for these new findings...|$|R

40|$|A layered canopy {{model was}} {{used to analyze the}} effects of <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> on canopy gross {{photosynthesis}} in controlled environment plant growth chambers, where, in contrast to the field, highly <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> can occur at high irradiance. The model suggests that high <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fractions (approximately 0. 7) and irradiance (1400 micromoles m- 2 s- 1) may enhance crop life-cycle canopy gross photosynthesis for hydroponic wheat by about 20 % compared to direct light at the same irradiance. Our simulations suggest that high accuracy is not needed in specifying <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> fractions in chambers between approximately 0. 7 and 1, because simulated photosynthesis for closed canopies plateau in this range. We also examined the effect of leaf angle distribution on canopy photosynthesis under growth chamber conditions, as these distributions determine canopy extinction coefficients for direct and <b>diffuse</b> <b>light.</b> We show that the spherical leaf angle distribution is not suitable for modeling photosynthesis of planophile canopies (e. g., soybean and peanut) in growth chambers. Also, the absorption of the light reflected from the surface below the canopy should generally be included in model simulations, as the corresponding albedo values in the photosynthetically active range may be quite high in growth chambers (e. g., approximately 0. 5). In addition to the modeling implications, our results suggest that <b>diffuse</b> <b>light</b> conditions should be considered when drawing conclusions from experiments in controlled environments...|$|R
