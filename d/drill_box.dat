The {{focus is on}} three bigsagebrush subspecies, Wyomingbigsagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis), basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata), and mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana). Natural colonization of the native plant community may be the preferred management action on sites where native seed sources are available to successfully reestablish the desired wildlife habitat. On highly disturbed or otherwise damaged sites and where competition from weeds is excessive, seeding,,~II be utilized to restore big sagebrush for wildlife habitat. Big sagebrush seed is never seeded alone in site rehabilitation and restoration projects. The best time to seed or interseed big sagebrush seed mixes, including grasses and forbs, is in late fall or early winter. The overall best method to reestablish big sagebrush {{is to use a}} rangeland drill at a shallow setting following site preparation, including tillage and weed control. When big sagebrush is drill seeded mth other seed types, it is recommended that it be seeded through a separate <b>drill</b> <b>box</b> to permit very shallow seeding and proper seed placement for plant establishment. Seedings of native plants, including big sagebrush, should be protected from grazing for at least 3 to 5 years to allow time for the shrubs and forbs to become established...|$|E

40|$|In {{the mining}} sector {{compressed}} air {{is used for}} <b>drilling,</b> loading <b>boxes,</b> refuse bays, cooling and agitation. Compressed air systems in large industrial applications generally operate inefficiently and are costly energy components. Intricate air reticulation networks supply air to working levels with very little control over air demand. The implementation of an Energy Management System for the optimisation of compressed air networks has shown that a large scope for energy efficiency projects exists. An in-depth investigation into the compressed air networks of a gold mine operation reveals an average energy efficiency potential of 2. 2 MW. This will save the mine in excess of 13, 700 MWh per annum resulting in electricity cost savings of more than R 3. 4 million. The benefits of such a system go beyond that of only the mine. Eskom will also benefit from fewer supply constraints and lower carbon emissions...|$|R

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite drill pipe (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel drill pipe, but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel counterpart. Funding for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite drill pipe consists of a composite material tube with standard <b>drill</b> pipe steel <b>box</b> and pin connections. Unlike metal drill pipe, composite drill pipe can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel drill pipe section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of drill pipe allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite drill pipe and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard <b>drill</b> pipe <b>box</b> and pin ends equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) bottom hole assemblies. Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite drill pipe developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear. ACPT is currently marketing a complete line of composite drill collars, subs, isolators, casing, and drill pipe to meet the drilling industry's needs and tailored to replace metal for specific application requirements...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. A large {{growth in}} the South African {{electrical}} power demand has created {{a situation where the}} primary electricity supplier, Eskom, is in dire need of generating additional electricity during peak demand times. The current electricity supply shortfall could mainly be {{due to a lack of}} planning from the suppliers' side, as well as an increase in residential and industrial development. Projections show that from as early as 2007, Eskom's current power generating ability would be insufficient for the country's peak electricity demand. Eskom launched a programme called Demand Side Management (DSM). This programme endorses a more electrical efficient society and also focuses on lowering South Africa's peak electricity demand. This programme has opened up many opportunities for companies, called Energy Service Companies or ESCOs, and individuals to help in this regard and also join in on a rewarding business opportunity. To be able to reduce electricity demand, these companies, ESCOs, have different strategies. Some focus on buildings, usually heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and other on heavy industries. By shifting or reducing electricity loads out of the peak electricity use period of a day, the peak load can be lowered. This reduces the risk of Eskom applying load-shedding as a last resort. Although many opportunities arise, the main focus in this thesis will be on the possible electrical load reduction on gold mines through implementing Demand Side Management (DSM) on their compressed air rings. Most gold mines are making use of compressed air for various applications. These include <b>drilling,</b> agitation, loading <b>boxes,</b> loading and many more. By studying the behaviour of a compressed air system on a gold mine, in particular a compressed air ring, large power saving opportunities occurs. Compressors are large electricity consumers and operate throughout the day. Because of the critical role that compressors play in a mine's production, correct management of these systems are of utmost importance. One must make sure that any proposed optimisation will not contribute to any loss of production at the mine. Master...|$|R
60|$|The hapless small incomes had {{the very}} worst end of the whole {{locality}} entirely to themselves, and absorbed all the noises and nuisances, just as the large incomes absorbed all the tranquillities and luxuries of suburban existence. Here were the dreary limits at which architectural invention stopped in despair. Each house in this poor man's purgatory was, indeed, and in awful literalness, a brick box with a slate top to it. Every hole <b>drilled</b> in these <b>boxes,</b> whether door-hole or window-hole, was always overflowing with children. They often mustered by forties and fifties in one street, and were the great pervading feature of the quarter. In {{the world of the}} large incomes, young life sprang up like a garden fountain, artificially playing only at stated periods in the sunshine. In the world of the small incomes, young life flowed out turbulently into the street, like an exhaustless kennel-deluge, in all weathers. Next to the children of the inhabitants, in visible numerical importance, came the shirts and petticoats, and miscellaneous linen of the inhabitants; fluttering out to dry publicly on certain days of the week, and enlivening the treeless little gardens where they hung, with lightsome avenues of pinafores, and solemn-spreading foliage of stout Welsh flannel. Here that absorbing passion for oranges (especially active when the fruit is half ripe, and the weather is bitter cold), which distinguishes the city English girl of the lower orders, flourished in its finest development; and here, also, the poisonous fumes of the holyday shop-boy's bad cigar told all resident nostrils when it was Sunday, as plainly as the church bells could tell it to all resident ears. The one permanent rarity in this neighborhood, on week days, was to discover a male inhabitant in any part of it, between the hours of nine in the morning and six in the evening; the one sorrowful sight which never varied, was to see that every woman, even to the youngest, looked more or less unhappy, often care-stricken, while youth was still in the first bud; oftener child-stricken before maturity was yet in the full bloom.|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is {{the last}} remnant of the Tethys Ocean that has been subducted to the north since the Jurassic. Subduction {{has led to the}} {{formation}} of multiple island arcs in the EMS region where the Aeolian and Aegean arcs are currently active. The EMS is surrounded by continents and receives a large sediment input, part of which is transported down with the subducting slab into the mantle and potentially contributes a major flux to the arc volcanism. An along-arc gradient in the composition of subducting sediment has been evoked to explain the distinct geochemical signature of the easternmost volcanic centre of the Aegean arc, but direct evidence for this proposal is lacking. We present a detailed study of the mineralogical, major-, trace elements and Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope composition of 45 Neogene EMS sediment samples obtained from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) <b>drill</b> sites and <b>box</b> cores to characterise their geochemical composition, distinguish provenance components and investigate the temporal and spatial variation in provenance to evaluate the potential changing contribution of subducted EMS sediment to Aegean and Aeolian arc volcanism. Based on trace element characteristics of EMS sediments, we can distinguish four provenance components. Nile sediment and Sahara dust are the main components, but contributions from the Tethyan ophiolite belt and arc volcanic rocks in the north are also recognised. Pliocene and Quaternary EMS sediment records a strong geochemical gradient where Nile River sediment entering the EMS in the east is progressively diluted by Sahara Desert dust towards the west. Pre-Messinian samples, however, have a remarkably homogeneous composition with Nile sediment characteristics. We relate this rapid increase in Sahara dust contribution to a late Miocene climate shift leading to decreased Nile runoff and aridification of the Sahara region. EMS sediment has a restricted range in Pb isotopes compared to Aegean volcanic rocks and therefore cannot account for the total variation in Aegean arc lavas. The bulk addition of 0. 5 - 5 % of EMS sediment satisfactorily explains most of the variation in volcanic rocks from the western and central centres, but the lo...|$|R
40|$|Scheduled {{to land in}} August of 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mission was {{initiated}} to explore the habitability of Mars. This includes both modern environments as well as ancient environments recorded by the stratigraphic rock record preserved at the Gale crater landing site. The Curiosity rover has a designed lifetime {{of at least one}} Mars year (∼ 23 months), and drive capability of at least 20 km. Curiosity’s science payload was specifically assembled to assess habitability and includes a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and gas analyzer that will search for organic carbon in rocks, regolith fines, and the atmosphere (SAM instrument); an x-ray diffractometer that will determine mineralogical diversity (CheMin instrument); focusable cameras that can image landscapes and rock/regolith textures in natural color (MAHLI, MARDI, and Mastcam instruments); an alpha-particle x-ray spectrometer for in situ determination of rock and soil chemistry (APXS instrument); a laser-induced breakdown spectrometer to remotely sense the chemical composition of rocks and minerals (ChemCam instrument); an active neutron spectrometer designed to search for water in rocks/regolith (DAN instrument); a weather station to measure modern-day environmental variables (REMS instrument); and a sensor designed for continuous monitoring of background solar and cosmic radiation (RAD instrument). The various payload elements will work together to detect and study potential sampling targets with remote and in situ measurements; to acquire samples of rock, soil, and atmosphere and analyze them in onboard analytical instruments; and to observe the environment around the rover. The 155 -km diameter Gale crater was chosen as Curiosity’s field site based on several attributes: an interior mountain of ancient flat-lying strata extending almost 5 km above the elevation of the landing site; the lower few hundred meters of the mountain show a progression with relative age from clay-bearing to sulfate-bearing strata, separated by an unconformity from overlying likely anhydrous strata; the landing ellipse is characterized by a mixture of alluvial fan and high thermal inertia/high albedo stratified deposits; and a number of stratigraphically/geomorphically distinct fluvial features. Samples of the crater wall and rim rock, and more recent to currently active surface materials also may be studied. Gale has a well-defined regional context and strong evidence for a progression through multiple potentially habitable environments. These environments are represented by a stratigraphic record of extraordinary extent, and insure preservation of a rich record of the environmental history of early Mars. The interior mountain of Gale Crater has been informally designated at Mount Sharp, in honor of the pioneering planetary scientist Robert Sharp. The major subsystems of the MSL Project consist of a single rover (with science payload), a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, an Earth-Mars cruise stage, an entry, descent, and landing system, a launch vehicle, and the mission operations and ground data systems. The primary communication path for downlink is relay through the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The primary path for uplink to the rover is Direct-from-Earth. The secondary paths for downlink are Direct-to-Earth and relay through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. Curiosity is a scaled version of the 6 -wheel drive, 4 -wheel steering, rocker bogie system from the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Spirit and Opportunity and the Mars Pathfinder Sojourner. Like Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity offers three primary modes of navigation: blind-drive, visual odometry, and visual odometry with hazard avoidance. Creation of terrain maps based on HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) and other remote sensing data were used to conduct simulated driving with Curiosity in these various modes, and allowed selection of the Gale crater landing site which requires climbing the base of a mountain to achieve its primary science goals. The Sample Acquisition, Processing, and Handling (SA/SPaH) subsystem is responsible for the acquisition of rock and soil samples from the Martian surface and the processing of these samples into fine particles that are then distributed to the analytical science instruments. The SA/SPaH subsystem is also responsible for the placement of the two contact instruments (APXS, MAHLI) on rock and soil targets. SA/SPaH consists of a robotic arm and turret-mounted devices {{on the end of the}} arm, which include a drill, brush, soil scoop, sample processing device, and the mechanical and electrical interfaces to the two contact science instruments. SA/SPaH also includes <b>drill</b> bit <b>boxes,</b> the organic check material, and an observation tray, which are all mounted on the front of the rover, and inlet cover mechanisms that are placed over the SAM and CheMin solid sample inlet tubes on the rover top deck. ...|$|R
