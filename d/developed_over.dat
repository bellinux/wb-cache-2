5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to a depression again on July 2 over northeast Madhya Pradesh. It degenerated into a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|A weak surface trough of low {{pressure}} emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with {{the formation of}} a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> Texas, providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear. A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi, and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound. As the upper-level low over Texas drifted southwestward, an anticyclone <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On August 7, the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana. It continued to become better organized, and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain. This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{visually}} {{similar to}} Rare's family-oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was designed for}} mature audiences and features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> the course of four years and was originally intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform games.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{has been}} argued that LMX is a {{phenomenon}} that <b>develops</b> <b>over</b> time, the existing LMX literature is largely cross-sectional in nature. Yet, there is a great need for unraveling how LMX <b>develops</b> <b>over</b> time. To address this issue in the LMX literature, we examine the relationships of LMX with two variables known for changing over time: job performance and justice perceptions. On the basis of current empirical findings, a simulation deductively shows that LMX <b>develops</b> <b>over</b> time, but differently in early stages versus more mature stages. Our findings also indicate that performance and justice trends affect LMX. Implications for LMX theory, and for longitudinal research on LMX, performance, and justice are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. He felt that his languages changed and <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> time, as with the historical languages which he studied professionally—not in a vacuum, {{but as a result}} of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} has <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> the centuries, reflecting direct {{teachings of}} early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars.

While many legends and folk-customs {{are thought to be}} ancient, for instance the tales featuring Offa of Angel and Wayland the Smith, others date from after the Norman invasion; Robin Hood and his Merry Men of Sherwood and their battles with the Sheriff of Nottingham being, perhaps, the best known.|$|E

The game was highly acclaimed by the gaming media and sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Games Award and four awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.|$|E

5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have <b>developed</b> <b>over</b> {{the years and}} represent different viewpoints and aims.

5|$|Seeds of Evil {{features}} a single-player campaign consisting of six levels and a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other}} in several game types. It supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which enables an optional high-resolution graphics mode.

When cartridges prices fell, developers ultimately decided to release it on a 32MB cartridge.|$|E
