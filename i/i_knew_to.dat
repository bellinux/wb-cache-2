On June 12, 1952, Aaron signed with Braves' scout Dewey Griggs. [...] During this time, {{he picked up the}} nickname 'pork chops' because it [...] "was the only thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> order off the menu." [...] A teammate later said, [...] "the man ate pork chops three meals a day, two for breakfast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{said that}} he [...] "was in a rather unique position" [...] in the {{disinformation}} campaign: [...] "judging by {{the positions of the}} people <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> be directly involved in it, [...] definitely {{had something to do with}} national security. There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why."(ibid., 164) ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{joined the}} Labour Party in 1977, but {{left it in}} 1983 {{when he became a}} {{political}} reporter at the Daily Express, thinking it wrong to carry a party card when directly reporting politics. This also coincided with a culmination of growing personal disillusionment with the Labour movement. [...] In 2009, Hitchens wrote of this period, [...] "Against the Labour Party, which <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> be penetrated by all manner of Marxists, and soaked in the ideas of the revolutionaries, it was increasingly necessary to support the Tories. This was partly because of the strikers' lies, but much more because of Poland and Czechoslovakia. On the Cold War, I knew she (Thatcher) was right and the Left were wrong." ...|$|E

[...] "At six minutes past nine every morning the phone would ring. John would say, 'C'mon over — and bring your thirst with you.' At the end when the emphysema took over and he was struggling with speech he had an oxygen mask and I often had to empty his bag for him. But he liked me being there because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn't try to say the words for him because I knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me – to be patient and quiet. But I always wanted to listen to John." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{four years}} of working on the project, Davis {{published}} Learning to Fly: An Uncommon Memoir of Human Flight, Unexpected Love, and One Amazing Dog in March 2013. Written after her difficult break up with Potter, it is about how she recovered {{from the loss of}} her partner and financial stability and used her developing love of skydiving to overcome her fear of falling. Described as [...] "gripping", it is a [...] "story of personal growth". She had faced a lot of fear free soloing, BASE jumping and sky diving and felt that she could offer people advice about facing fear in general. As she said in an interview, [...] "A big part of the reason I wanted to write the book is that most people have had experiences like this , or will, whether it's a relationship or a career or whatever," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "Even a happy person can become depressed. When you're in that place, if you have some kind of guidance, some ray of hope … What <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> hold on to was climbing and this whole new world of skydiving and having new experiences. Life's about change. Don't be afraid." ...|$|E
