25|$|Current <b>dialectology</b> upholds Pskov and Polotsk as the {{two cities}} where the Tale was most likely written.

25|$|Scanian once possessed many unique words {{which do}} not exist in either Swedish or Danish. In {{attempts}} to preserve the unique aspects of Scanian, these words have been recorded and documented by the Institute for <b>Dialectology,</b> Onomastics and Folklore Research in Sweden. Preservation is also accomplished through comparative studies such as the Scanian-Swedish-Danish dictionary project, commissioned by the Scanian Academy. This project is led by Helmer Lång and involves a group of scholars from different fields, including Birger Bergh, linguistics, Inger Elkjær and Inge Lise Pedersen, researcher of Danish dialects. Several Scanian dictionaries have been published through the years, including one by Sten Bertil Vide, who wrote his doctoral thesis on the names of plants in South Swedish dialects. This publication {{and a variety of}} other Scanian dictionaries are available through the Department of <b>Dialectology</b> and Onomastics in Lund.|$|E
25|$|At present, no {{comprehensive}} <b>dialectology</b> {{has been}} done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. Ethnologue lists Lubang, Manila, Marinduque, Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the Bulacan dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.|$|E
25|$|Although {{his work}} in <b>dialectology</b> {{has been the most}} influential, Alvar's work {{broached}} other topics such as the linguistics of Romance languages in general, historical linguistics, toponymy, medieval literature (serving as principal investigator along with the University of Wisconsin in developing the Spanish Medieval Dictionary in 1978), translation, history of the Americas, among others. In terms of <b>dialectology,</b> Alvar wrote, directed, or coordinated the development of many linguistic atlases and Spanish-language research published in Spain and Latin America {{during the second half of}} the 20th century, including the Atlas Lingüístico y Etnográfico de Andalucía (ALEA), the Atlas Lingüístico de España y Portugal (ALEP), the Atlas Lingüístico de Castilla y León (ALCyL), and the Linguistic and Ethnographical Atlas of Argentina (AleCuyo). Alvar served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Atlas Linguarum Europae (ALE) in Holland in 1971, a linguistic atlas supported by UNESCO which includes Altaic languages, Basque, Indo-European languages, Ibero-Caucasian languages, Semitic languages and Uralic languages. Forty-seven national committees and four minority language committees worked on this atlas. Other important atlases Alvar has worked on include an Atlas Lingüístico de Andalucía (1957-1959).|$|E
25|$|Manuel Alvar (July 8, 1923 - August 13, 2001) was a Spanish linguist, historian, and {{university}} professor {{who specialized in}} the study of <b>dialectology</b> and philology of the Spanish language. Throughout his career, Alvar oversaw and influenced the creation of many Spanish linguistic atlases; maps which recorded speech variations in a given geographical area. He served as Director of the Real Academia Española for four years, and was a member of language academies throughout Europe and Latin America.|$|E
25|$|However, the 19th century saw {{the rise}} of <b>dialectology</b> and the {{categorisation}} of dialects. German dialectologists termed the German varieties spoken in the mountainous south of Germany as Hochdeutsch ("High German"). Subsequently, German varieties spoken in the north were designated as Niederdeutsch ("Low German"). These were in the Dutch language area calqued as the exonyms Nederduits and Hoogduits and referred now to the German varieties of standard German. As a result, the Hoog ("High") was dropped in the Dutch exonym Hoogduits {{in the sense of}} the German standard language, meaning that Duits narrowed down as Dutch exonym for German. Moreover, Nederduits lost its meaning as endonym for Dutch, and Nederlands prevailed as sole Dutch endonym.|$|E
500|$|Diaphonemic systems don't {{necessarily}} {{even have}} to utilize the IPA. [...] Diaphones are useful in constructing a writing system that accommodates multiple dialects with different phonologies. [...] Even in <b>dialectology,</b> diaphonemic transcriptions may instead {{be based on the}} language's orthography, {{as is the case with}} Lee Pederson's Automated Book Code designed for information from the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States. and the diaphonemic transcription system used by Paul Geraghty for related Fijian languages uses a modified Roman script.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by , Uriel Weinreich first {{advocated}} {{the use of}} diasystems in structural <b>dialectology,</b> and suggested that such a system would represent {{a higher level of}} abstraction that can unite related dialects into a single description and transcription. While phonemic systems describe the speech of a single variety, diaphonemic systems can reflect the contrasts that aren't made by all varieties being represented. [...] The way these differ can be shown in the name New York. This word may be transcribed phonemically as [...] in American English, as many varieties thereof do not allow the cluster [...] as a syllable onset; in Received Pronunciation, syllable-final [...] doesn't occur so this name would be transcribed [...] to reflect that pronunciation. A diaphonemic transcription such as [...] (with both the [...] and the [...] ) would thus cover both dialects. Neither is described exactly, but both are derivable from the diaphonemic transcription.|$|E

2500|$|The {{people of}} Miryang speak {{a version of}} the Gyeongsang dialect of Korean. [...] In studies of Korean <b>dialectology,</b> Miryang dialect has been contrasted with the Changwon dialect in terms of the use of pitch.|$|E
2500|$|Unicode {{supports}} polytonic orthography {{well enough}} for ordinary continuous text in modern and ancient Greek, and even many archaic forms for epigraphy. With {{the use of}} combining characters, Unicode also supports Greek philology and <b>dialectology</b> and various other specialized requirements. Most current text rendering engines do not render diacritics well, so, though alpha with macron and acute can be represented as U+03B1 U+0304 U+0301, this rarely renders well: [...]|$|E
2500|$|Similar to many {{languages}} in the Philippines, very little research on <b>dialectology</b> {{has been done}} on Hiligaynon. Some of the widely recognized varieties of the language are Standard or Urban Hiligaynon (Iloilo provincial and Iloilo City variant), simply called [...] "Ilonggo", Bacolodnon Hiligaynon (Metro Bacolod variant), Negrense Hiligaynon (provincial Negros Occidental variant which is composed of 3 sub-variants: Northern, Central and Southern Negrense Hiligaynon), Guimaras Hiligaynon, and Mindanao Hiligaynon. Some native speakers also consider Kinaray-a (also known as Hiniraya or Antiqueño) and Capiznon as dialects of Hiligaynon; however, these have been classified by linguists as separate (Western) Visayan languages.|$|E
2500|$|Arrúe, {{an amateur}} with no {{professional}} background either in linguistics or ethnography, {{was in the}} second row of those scientifically contributing to the Basque culture. His works – articles published in Basque- and Spanish-language periodicals, mostly in Egan – are loosely scattered across many disciplines: history of Basque literature, history of Basque linguistics, grammar of Basque language, Basque <b>dialectology,</b> history of Basque social movement, Basque anthropology, [...] theory of contemporary Basque poetry, Basque history, Basque cuisine and foreign literature; {{it was only the}} question of Basque political ambitions that he avoided – at least in the Francoist Spain – and usually approached only as part of the Carlist history.|$|E
2500|$|For Alvar's later publication, [...] "Atlas lingüístico y etnográfico de Aragón" [...] (1979-1983), he and {{his team}} {{transcribed}} words pronounced in isolation, elicited from residents of the Aragón region. He used a similar method to elicit data from people living in the Canary Islands and published a linguistic atlas of this dialect in 1975. Alvar was a strong proponent of smaller linguistic atlases focusing on regional variation rather than larger national atlases—his Atlas Lingüístico de España y Portugal reflects this preference, though that atlas began more than 30 years ago with the fieldwork still not complete. Alvar has also been criticized for using overly traditional field methods in his <b>dialectology</b> studies, for example focusing on forms in isolation rather than in context, or leaving out morphosyntactic variables.|$|E
2500|$|Scanian (...) is {{a closely}} related group of South Swedish dialects spoken in the {{province}} of Scania in southern Sweden. Scanian formed part of the old Scandinavian dialect continuum and are by most historical linguists considered to be an East Danish dialect group, but due to the modern-era influence from Standard Swedish in the region and because traditional <b>dialectology</b> in the Scandinavian countries normally has not considered [...] isoglosses that cut across state borders, the Scanian dialects have normally been treated as a South Swedish dialect group in Swedish dialect research. However, many of the early Scandinavian linguists, including Adolf Noreen and G. Sjöstedt, classified it as [...] "South Scandinavian", and some linguists, such as Elias Wessén, also considered Old Scanian a separate language, classified apart from both Old Danish and Old Swedish.|$|E
2500|$|For most scholars, {{the problem}} has been in how to connect the Slovene and the German names. The origin from the Slavic ljub- [...] "to love, like" [...] was in 2007 {{supported}} as the most probable by the linguist Tijmen Pronk, a specialist in comparative Indo-European linguistics and Slovene <b>dialectology,</b> from the University of Leiden. He supported the thesis that the name of the river derived from the name of the settlement. The linguist Silvo Torkar, who specializes in Slovene personal and place names, argued at the same place for the thesis that the name Ljubljana derives from Ljubija, the original name of the Ljubljanica River flowing through it, itself derived from the Old Slavic male name Ljubovid, [...] "the one of a lovely appearance". The name Laibach, he claimed, was actually a hybrid of German and Slovene and derived from the same personal name.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Dacoromania {{appeared}} from 1921 to 1948, in eleven enormous volumes totaling some 9,000 pages. The magazine contained studies, articles, notes and reviews, mainly on linguistics (lexicology, <b>dialectology,</b> linguistic geography, language history, onomastics, general linguistics, grammar, phonetics and phonology) and philology, {{as well as}} research on history and literary criticism, cultural history and folklore. Each edition included a bibliography that systematically recorded writings on linguistics, philology, folklore, ethnography and literature, connected to Romanian language, culture and literature, both domestically and abroad. Three generations of scholars worked on the magazine, with most articles presented at weekly meetings. Pușcariu, in an obituary for Nicolae Drăganu, commented on these sessions' usefulness, noting how the members would benefit from constructive criticism, [...] "sometimes pointed, mainly intelligent, but never bitter, for the critical spirit never originated from a pleasure to destroy, but from a desire to complete, while the joy in another's discovery was always greater than the temptation to persist in a mistake".|$|E
2500|$|Alvar {{served as}} a member of several prestigious {{language}} academies. He served as Director of the Real Academia Española from 1988 until 1991. The Academy, based in Madrid, is the official royal institution responsible for overseeing the Spanish language. Alvar was {{also a member of the}} Academia Colombiana de la Lengua (specializing in the use of Spanish in Colombia and counseling the Colombian government in language affairs and regulations), la Academia Argentina de Letras (which is closely affiliated with the Royal Spanish Academy {{as a member of}} the Association of Spanish Language Academies), and la Academia Mexicana de la Lengua (likewise dedicated to the conservation and purity of the Spanish language as well as increasing the study of Spanish, according to its stated objectives). Alvar was also a member of several historical and cultural academies, including the Real Academia de la Historia, appointed to serve as director in 1999 (replacing Luis Díez del Corral). The Academia studies history [...] "ancient and modern, political, civil, ecclesiastical, military, scientific, of letters and arts, of civilization, and of the culture of the Spanish people." [...] Beginning in 1963, Alvar also served as director of the CSIC Department of Linguistic Geography and <b>Dialectology,</b> Spain's largest public institution dedicated to Spanish language research.|$|E
50|$|Historical perceptual <b>dialectology</b> allows {{linguists}} {{to examine}} how and why dialects in the past gained popularity.

50|$|Historical perceptual <b>dialectology</b> {{must not}} be {{confused}} with historical linguistics, which is concerned with changes in linguistic phenomena over time.

50|$|Perceptual <b>dialectology</b> {{differs from}} {{standard}} <b>dialectology</b> {{in that it}} is concerned not with formal linguistic differences among dialects, but rather with how nonlinguists perceive them (which may or may not correlate with scientific linguistic findings).
