40|$|Objectives: The {{mixture of}} six β-blockers was {{analyzed}} in human plasma by SPE and <b>HPLC</b> <b>methods.</b> Methods: Timolol, atenolol, oxprenolol, alprenolol, acebutolol and carazolol were separated using Phenyl-Ethyl column (PhE, 250 x 4. 6 mm, 5. 0 μm). The mobile phase was phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 3. 0) -acetonitrile (70 : 30, v/v) at 1. 0 mL/min flow rate. The detection {{was set at}} 220 nm and 27 ± 1 ºC temperature. Results: The values of chromatographic parameters i. e. capacity (k), separation (α) and resolution factor (Rs) were {{in the range of}} 2. 76 - 17. 72, 1. 14 - 1. 82 and 2. 11 - 6. 64, respectively. The limits of detection and quantification were 0. 1 - 0. 5 µg/mL and 0. 6 - 0. 30 µg/mL, respectively. The percentage recoveries of extraction were in the range of 32. 30 - 50. 5 %. π-π, hydrophobic and polar interactions between β-blockers and phenyl-ethyl column were responsible for the separation. The reported SPE and <b>HPLC</b> <b>methods</b> were efficient, reproducible, fast and selective. The developed and validated methods were applied for monitoring six β-blockers in human plasma.

25|$|Efficiency factor (N) {{practically}} measures how sharp component peaks on the chromatogram are, as {{ratio of}} the component peak's area ("retention time") relative to {{the width of the}} peaks at their widest point (at the baseline). Peaks that are tall, sharp, and relatively narrow indicate that separation method efficiently removed a component from a mixture; high efficiency.

The validated NDA-applied <b>HPLC</b> <b>method</b> was adjusted to 15 lots of Histobulin and compared by the current lot-release-test method using fluorimetry in recovery of histamine and reproducibility. ResultsAnalyses of six HPLC chromatograms using NDA and OPA each were compared. NDA produced a more stable chromatogram baseline than OPA, and showed better stability. The HPLC analysis was validated in accuracy (91 – 103 %), precision (interday/intraday assay CV ≤ 2. 30 %), and linearity of dose–response curve (R 2  ≥  0. 9919). The detection limit was 0. 0076  μg/mL and the quantitative limit was 0. 0229  μg/mL.
