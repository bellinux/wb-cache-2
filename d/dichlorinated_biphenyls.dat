40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{degradation of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{has been studied}} in aqueous media and contaminated soils. A novel SAmarium Catalyzed REDuctive dechlorination (SACRED) is demonstrated which is able to operate in a short timescale under mild conditions (ambient temperature; inert atmosphere) and with low energy requirements. Samarium (II) iodide, {{in the presence of}} hexamethylphosphoramide in tetrahydrofuran, catalyses hydrogenolytic dechlorination of highly chlorinated PCBs, generating biphenyl, mono- and <b>dichlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> from Aroclor 1242. Catalysis is also effective in co-contaminated soils containing various PCBs and in the presence of up to 5 % (w/w) moisture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of 21 chloro{{biphenyl}}s by the enzymes of {{the upper}} biphenyl catabolic pathway encoded by the bph locus of Pseudomonas sp. strain LB 400 was investigated by using recombinant strains harboring gene cassettes containing bphABC or bphABCD. The enzymes {{of the upper}} pathway were generally able to metabolize mono- and <b>dichlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> but only partially transform most trichlorinated congeners investigated: 14 of 15 mono- and dichlorinated and 2 of 6 trichlorinated congeners were converted into benzoates. All mono- and at least 8 of 12 dichlorinated congeners were attacked by the bphA-encoded biphenyl dioxygenase virtually exclusively at ortho and meta carbons. This enzyme exhibited {{a high degree of}} selectivity for the aromatic ring to be attacked, with the order of ring preference being non- > ortho- > meta- > para-substituted for mono- and dichlorinated congeners. The influence of the chlorine substitution pattern of the metabolized ring on benzoate formation resembled its influence on the reactivity of initial dioxygenation, suggesting that the rate of benzoate formation may frequently be determined by the rate of initial attack. The absorption spectra of phenylhexadienoates formed correlated with {{the presence or absence of}} a chlorine substituent at an ortho position...|$|E
40|$|The oxygenase {{component}} of biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) from Comamonas testosteroni B- 356 dihydroxylates biphenyl and some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), thereby initiating their degradation. Identification of molecular determinants for BPDO substrate selectivity and activity should allow engineering it {{to accept a}} range of chlorinated biphenyls for bioremediation. Highly active BPDO has been purified, and crystallized under anaerobic conditions. The first crystal structures of BPDO, and its substrate-bound and product-bound binary complexes, have been solved. Steady-state kinetics assays monitoring O 2 consumption demonstrated that BPDO transformed biphenyl and dichlorobiphenyls with the following order of apparent specificities: biphenyl > 3, 3 ' - > 2, 2 ' - > 4, 4 ' -dichlorobiphenyl, but with specificity constants all within a factor of 3. The ability of the enzyme to utilize O 2 depended strongly on the biphenyl substrate, with specificity constants for oxygen over one order of magnitude smaller {{in the presence of}} the <b>dichlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> compared to biphenyl. Moreover, the selected dichlorobiphenyls were found to be partial uncouplers of the reaction, reducing O 2 to H 2 O 2. Based on the high-resolution crystal structure of BPDO and its binary complexes, the roles of some specific residues were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, three BPDOs sharing between 70 - 95 % sequence identity were overexpressed, purified in highly active forms, and compared in terms of steady-state kinetic parameters for biphenyls, as well as uncoupling behaviour. BPDO comprises two metal centers required for enzymatic activity: a catalytic mononuclear iron and a [2 Fe- 2 S] Rieske-type cluster for electron transfer. To overexpress holo-BPDOs, the iron-sulfur cluster (isc) assembly genes from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA 01 were cloned and used for coexpression. The Fe-S cluster of BPDO was shown to be sensitive to reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, but the isc gene products appeared to have the ability to repair damaged clusters in crude extract reconstitution assays. The experimental approaches and results described in this thesis contribute to the identification of structural features important for substrate selectivity, and ultimately may be useful for construction of modified BPDOs with enhanced activity on chlorinated biphenyl...|$|E
