It suggested that two criteria should be met: that buildings containing equipment important for safety should be built on a surface at least as high as the highest water level plus a safety margin (the cote majorée de sécurité or 'enhanced safety height'), and that any such buildings below this level should be sealed to prevent water ingress. It also contained an initial analysis which found that, in addition to Blayais, the plants as Belleville, Chinon, Dampierre, Gravelines and Saint-Laurent were all below the 'enhanced safety height' and that their safety measures should be re-examined. It also found that although the plants at Bugey, Cruas, Flamanville, Golfech, Nogent, Paluel, Penly and Saint-Alban met the first criterion, the second should be verified; and called for the plants at Fessenheim and Tricastin to be re-examined since they were below the level of major adjacent canals. The consequent upgrading work, implemented over the following years, is estimated to have cost approximately 110,000,000 euro.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the highest {{performances}} requested by the safety authorities for ultrasonic inspections, in terms of flaw characterization, the CEA (French Atomic Energy Commission) has developped the F. A. U. S. T. (Focusing Adaptive UltraSonic Tomography) system, supported by the french Institute <b>for</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Protection</b> and Safety (IPSN). This technique is based on phased array transducers dynamically controlled by a multi-channel acquisition system, allowing several different delay and amplitude laws at transmission and reception. Each US channel can be stored, enabling various reconstruction and imaging procedures. This allows conventional phased array techniques, as variable depth focusing and 3 D beam steering, but also beam apodization with non-uniform profiles, or tandem (separated transmission and reception elements) techniques. Current studies and experiments include defect characterization using the information received by {{each part of the}} array and 3 D steering around the defect. Experiments carried out with various reflectors show the ability of the system to discriminate different types of defect and to characterize them. THE-FAUST ' (FOCUSING ADAPTIVE ULTRASONIC TOMOGRAPHY) SYSTEM was developed at the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) to improve performances of ultrasonic non destructive testing in terms of adaptability to various control configurations and defect characterization. The focusing of an ultrasonic transducer is obtained by applying a delay to each elementary emitting source of the transmitting array so that elementary contributions constructively interfere in a given zone of the inspected component. For monolithic standard transducers, this delay is provided either by a lens or by the direct shaping of the emitting surface. The inherent design of these conventional technologies does not allow to vary the delay law so that the geometry of the focused beam is fixed. The FAUST syste...|$|E

Selection of the appropriate testing method is an important practical task. A significant characteristic for this selection process is understanding the effect of testing methods on software reliability, specifically their ability to reveal faults.

Computerized systems <b>for</b> <b>nuclear</b> material <b>protection,</b> control, and accountability (MPC and A) are a vital component of integrated nuclear safeguards programs. This paper describes the progress of scientists in the United States and former Soviet Republics in creating customized, computerized MPC and A systems.

The CoreMAS approach and corresponding software package have been made available to sites internationally. CoreMAS provides methods to evaluate their existing systems and to examine advantages and disadvantages of customizing CoreMAS or improving their own existing systems.

Biological estimates of accidental overexposure were first obtained by scoring radio-induced unstable structural chromosome aberrations (dicentrics, centric rings, and fragments) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. For dose estimates, the yield of these chromosomal aberrations observed in 500 metaphases was compared with the laboratory dose-response relationship established from human blood irradiated in vitro (gamma-rays, 60 Co, 0. 5 Gy/min). To extend the possibilities of detecting DNA damage from earlier exposures by visualizing stable chromosome aberrations, chromosome painting by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH painting) was developed using a cocktail of three composite whole human chromosome-specific DNA probes (numbers 2, 4, and 12). A laboratory calibration curve for scoring terminal and/or reciprocal translocations was established for the same radiation quality and dose rate as those used for conventional cytogenetics (gamma-rays, 60 Co, 0. 5 Gy/min). For dosimetry purposes, it was also important to verify whether FISH painting could be applied to each human blood sample assessed for conventional expertise.
