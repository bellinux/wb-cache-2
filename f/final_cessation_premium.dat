However, it remains unclear whether HIV-related disease progresses more rapidly in patients harboring virus swarms with low or high diversity and, in the same context, whether high or low diversity is required to induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses. To explore whether viral diversity predicts virologic control, we studied HIV-infected patients who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for years before undergoing structured treatment interruptions (STI). Viral diversity before initiation of ART {{and the ability of}} the patients to contain viremia after STI and <b>final</b> <b>cessation</b> of treatment was evaluated.

Viral diversity pre-ART correlated with the viral replication capacity of rebounding virus isolates during STI. Neutralizing antibody activity against autologous virus was significantly higher in patients who controlled viremia and was associated with lower pretreatment diversity. No such association was found with binding antibodies directed to gp 120.

Little is known about the mechanisms that account for these characteristics of ovarian cycles as the menopause approaches. Some evidence suggests that the dwindling pool of follicles itself is responsible for cycle characteristics during the perimenopausal transition. Another hypothesis is that the increased variability reflects "slippage " of the hypothalamus, which loses the ability to regulate menstrual cycles at older reproductive ages. We examine the underlying cause of the increasing variability in menstrual cycle length prior to the menopause.

Alexander found that the absence of ovarian steroids does not influence the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) : the mean level of GnRH does not change with advanCing age. The lack of response of postmenopausal ovaries to endogenous gonadotropin stimulation is a result of primary age-related changes in the ovaries, not in the hypothalamus. As a result ofthe decrease in estrogens, the feed-back of ovarian estrogens on the hypothalamus diminishes, resulting in high FSH levels. A high serum FSH level is the only constant laboratory finding in the postmenopausal years. Apart from hormonal changes other effects of the aging do occur.

The dyke intrudes pre-Strombolian andesite lavas, and the overlying proximal basaltic-andesite scoria deposits associated with contemporaneous lavas, which are, in turn overlain by laminated lapilli-tuff and large blocks. Textural and kinematic evidence of ductile shear recorded in basaltic andesite at the dyke margins records magma deformation imposed by bypassing movement of magma up {{the centre of the}} conduit during the eruption, whereas the basaltic andesite occupying {{the central part of the}} lowermost exposures of the dyke preserves ductile flow-folds with the opposite (down-flow) shear sense. The evidence indicates that the downward magma flow followed the eruption, and this draining left the central part of the dyke empty (unfilled) at uppermost levels. We discuss the kinematic constraints in the context of the criteria for up-flow of mafic magma and present the factors most likely to result in a final drain-back event. With reference to experimental and numerical work, we propose a draining model for the end of this eruption, and that magmatic drain-back may feature commonly during closing stages of Strombolian eruptions at mafic volcanoes. Drain-back which leaves large cavities in a volcanic edifice could result in hazardous structural instabilities. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

We find notably higher cessation rates among younger beneficiaries in our population. For example, DI workers age 18 to 30 have a 13  % cessation rate compared to less than 3  % for workers age 50 to 59. This {{can also be seen}} in the age distribution of the continued and ceased groups, where the ceased group has a much larger proportion of younger DI workers than the continued group. Some of the largest differences in cessation rates occur within primary diagnosis categories. We see relatively high cessation rates for those with neoplasms (18  %), and diseases of the genitourinary system (13  %), and low cessation rates in the congenital anomalies and endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic systems diseases categories (less than 4  %). There may be substantial differences in the employment outcomes by these groups. Prior research has shown that the employment and earnings of beneficiaries vary greatly by impairment type (Mann et al. 2015). Additionally, there may be large differences within impairment groups, as younger beneficiaries have been shown to have better employment outcomes in general (Ben-Shalom and Mamun 2015). However, we do not hypothesize who will be more or less able to return to their prior field of employment or benefit more from existing support structures.|$|R
40|$|Menopause is {{the final}} {{step in the process}} {{referred}} to as ovarian ageing. The age related decrease in follicle numbers dictates the onset of cycle irregularity and the <b>final</b> <b>cessation</b> of menses. The parallel decay in oocyte quality contributes to the gradual decline in fertility and the final occurrence of natural sterility. Endocrine changes mainly relate to the decline in the negative feedback from ovarian factors at the hypothalamo-pituitary unit. The declining cohort of antral follicles with age first results in gradually elevated FSH levels, followed by subsequent stages of overt cycle irregularity. The gradual decline {{in the size of the}} antral follicle cohort is best represented by decreasing levels of anti-Mullerian hormone. The variability of ovarian ageing among women is evident from the large variation in age at menopause. The identification of women who have severely decreased ovarian reserve for their age is clinically relevant. Ovarian reserve tests have appeared to be fairly accurate in predicting response to ovarian stimulation in the assisted reproductive technology (ART) setting. The capacity to predict the chances for spontaneous pregnancy or pregnancy after ART appears very limited. As menopause and the preceding decline in oocyte quality seem to have a fixed time interval, tests that predict the age at menopause may be useful to assess individual reproductive lifespan. Especially genetic studies, both addressing candidate gene and genome wide association, have identified several interesting loci of small genetic variation that may determine fetal follicle pool development and subsequent wastage of his pool over time. Improved knowledge of the ovarian ageing mechanisms may ultimately provide tools for prediction of menopause and manipulation of the early steps of folliculogenesis for the purpose of contraception and fertility lifespan extension.

Specifically, DOE EM-OR requested ORAU to plan and implement a survey approach, focused on characterizing the Isotope Row Facilities located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for future determination of an appropriate disposition pathway for building debris and systems, should the buildings be demolished. The characterization effort was designed to identify and quantify radiological and chemical contamination associated with building structures and process systems. The Isotope Row Facilities discussed in this report include Bldgs. 3030, 3031, 3032, 3033, 3033 A, 3034, 3036, 3093, and 3118, and {{are located in the}} northeast quadrant of the main ORNL campus area, between Hillside and Central Avenues.

The Isotope Row facilities were intended for the purpose of light industrial use for the processing, assemblage, and storage of radionuclides used for a variety of applications (ORNL 1952 and ORAU 2013). The Isotope Row Facilities provided laboratory and support services as part of the Isotopes Production and Distribution Program until 1989 when DOE mandated their shutdown (ORNL 1990).

40|$|It is immensely {{difficult}} {{to provide a}} detailed historical account {{of the development of}} fatigue as a concept in the exercise sciences. However, the study of fatigue stretches back centuries to scientists such as Galvani who provided the ideas and tools to undertake experiments related to the electrical impulses needed to animate skeletal muscles [1]. The definitive work of Mosso in the 18 th Century stands as a landmark in the study of fatigue [2]. In his book La fatica (fatigue) [2] he concluded that there were two phenomena which categorized fatigue; “The first is the diminution of the muscular force. The second is fatigue as a sensation. That is to say, we have a physical fact which can be measured and compared, and a psychic fact which eludes measurement” [p. 154]. Notably, early textbooks such as Physiology of muscular exercise by Bainbridge in 1931 [3] pointed out that the limit of exercise “has often been ascribed to the capacity of the heart alone, but the facts as a whole indicate that the sum of the changes taking place throughout the body brings about the <b>final</b> <b>cessation</b> of effort” [p. 176]. It is an interesting fact that research into fatigue is highly complex and consensus about the aetiology of this human condition still evades us. Not surprisingly, even after centuries of research in this area, fatigue is still {{very much a part of}} medical and social discourse. There may be several reasons for this, not least of which could be the loss or change in the meaning of the term fatigue. The Oxford Dictionary [4] defines fatigue as “extreme tiredness after exertion; reduction in efficiency of a muscle, organ etc. after prolonged activity”. Compare this definition to that of exhaustion which is often used interchangeably by exercise physiologists and which is defined as “a total loss of strength; to consume or use up the whole of” [4]; clearly, these are substantially different meanings. In addition to these general meanings, there is wide variation in definitions of fatigue in the exercise sciences which include statements such as “the failure to maintain the required or expected force” [5], or “a loss of maximal force generating capacity” [6] or “a reversible state of force depression, including a lower rate of rise of force and a slower relaxation” [7]. There are many more statements or definitions like these which attempt to capture the specific observation that there has been a decline in the ability to produce skeletal muscle tension of a given magnitude in order to quantify the amount of fatigue that has developed...|$|R

6000|$|... § III. And it is {{just that}} it should be so seen, for it is the {{original}} of nearly all the rest. It is not the elaborate and more studied developement of a national style, but the great and sudden invention of one man, instantly forming a national style, and becoming the model for the imitation of every architect in Venice for upwards of a century. It was the determination of this one fact which occupied me the greater part of the time I spent in Venice. It had always appeared to me most strange that there should be in no part of the city any incipient or imperfect types of the form of the Ducal Palace; it was difficult to believe that so mighty a building had been the conception of one man, not only in disposition and detail, but in style; and yet impossible, had it been otherwise, but that some early examples of approximate Gothic form must exist. There is not one. The palaces built between the <b>final</b> <b>cessation</b> of the Byzantine style, about 1300, and the date of the Ducal Palace (1320-1350), are all completely distinct in character, so distinct that I at first intended the account of them to form a separate section of this volume; and there is literally no transitional form between them and the perfection of the Ducal Palace. Every Gothic building in Venice which resembles the latter is a copy of it. I do not mean that there was no Gothic in Venice before the Ducal Palace, but that the mode of its application to domestic architecture had not been determined. The real root of the Ducal Palace is the apse of the church of the Frari. The traceries of that apse, though earlier and ruder in workmanship, are nearly the same in mouldings, and precisely the same in treatment (especially in the placing of the lions' heads), as those of the great Ducal Arcade; and the originality of thought in the architect of the Ducal Palace consists in his having adapted those traceries, in a more highly developed and finished form, to civil uses. In the apse of the church they form narrow and tall window lights, somewhat more massive than those of Northern Gothic, but similar in application: the thing to be done was to adapt these traceries to the forms of domestic building necessitated by national usage. The early palaces consisted, as we have seen, of arcades sustaining walls faced with marble, rather broad and long than elevated. This form was kept for the Ducal Palace; but instead of round arches from shaft to shaft, the Frari traceries were substituted, with two essential modifications. Besides being enormously increased in scale and thickness, that they might better bear the superincumbent weight, the quatrefoil, which in the Frari windows is above the arch, as at a, Fig. XXI., on previous page, was, in the Ducal Palace, put between the arches, as at b; the main reason for this alteration being that the bearing power of the arches, which was now to be trusted with the weight of a wall forty feet high,[75] was thus thrown between the quatrefoils, instead of under them, and thereby applied at far better advantage. And, in the second place, the joints of the masonry were changed. In the Frari (as often also in St. John and St. Paul's) the tracery is formed of two simple cross bars or slabs of stone, pierced into the requisite forms, and separated by a horizontal joint, just on a level with the lowest cusp of the quatrefoils, as seen in Fig. XXI., a. But at the Ducal Palace the horizontal joint is in the centre of the quatrefoils, and two others are introduced beneath it at right angles to the run of the mouldings, as seen in Fig. XXI., b.[76] The Ducal Palace builder was sternly resolute in carrying out this rule of masonry. In the traceries of the large upper windows, where the cusps are cut through as in the quatrefoil Fig. XXII., the lower cusp is left partly solid, as at a, merely that the joint a b may have its right place and direction.|$|R

These goals are feasible {{with the addition of}} brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic and metabolic testing. The present work analysed the medical literature on WS and reports the principal therapeutic protocols of its management. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), vigabatrin (VGB) and corticosteroids are the first-line treatments for WS. There is no unique therapeutic protocol for ACTH, but most of the evidence suggests that low doses are as effective as high doses for short-term treatment, which is generally 2 weeks followed by dose tapering. VGB is generally administered at doses from 50 to 150 mg/kg/day, but its related retinal toxicity, which occurs in 21 - 34 % of infants, is most frequently observed when treatment periods last longer than 6 months. Among corticosteroids, a treatment of 14 days of oral prednisolone (40 - 60 mg/day) has been considered effective and well tolerated.

While beneficial over alternative control products in many respects, late season S 0 applications increase the potential for undesirable "reduced" aroma development in wine produced from treated fruit, as residual S 0 concentrations > 1 - 10 [MICRO SIGN]/g increase H 2 S evolution during fermentation. However, the persistence of S 0 in the vineyard and through vinification is poorly understood, partially owing to the limitations of previous methods for S 0 analysis in media that contain other forms of sulfur. A simple, economical technique was developed to quantify S 0 residues on grapes in the vineyard and throughout vinification. The technique is based upon complete conversion of S 0 to H 2 S and the subsequent capture and quantification of that gas using commercially available detection tubes. This method was then utilized to analyze grape and must samples from 3 years of field trials, in which the variable factors were S 0 formulation, dose, and application timing relative to harvest. Additionally, a series of investigations was undertaken {{to better understand the}} impact that increased H 2 S production during fermentation has on final wine chemistry. While formulation and application rate affected S 0 iii residue concentration and persistence for some treatments, timing between final treatment and harvest consistently had an effect on <b>final</b> residue concentrations. <b>Cessation</b> of S 0 application 35 days or more prior to harvest resulted in S 0 levels below 10 [MICRO SIGN]g/g for all treatments. For some treatments, harvest S 0 residues below 10 [MICRO SIGN]g/g were observed even when spraying was ceased as late as 22 days before harvest. In wine produced from the S 0 field trials in which elevated H 2 S production was observed, there was also increased incidence of H 2 S formation in finished wines post bottling, even though no H 2 S was present at bottling. The H 2 S that re-emerged 3 -weeks and 6 -months post bottling correlated well with H 2 S produced during fermentation. H 2 S produced during fermentation also correlated well with a "latent" pool of H 2 S that was releasable by treating the wine with a reducing agent. In a separate experiment, the effects of the timing of light exposure on grape derived volatiles was explored. Fruiting zone leaf removal is a common practice to increase light exposure, which has been shown to reduce disease pressure and positively influence ripening. The compound TDN (1, 1, 6 -trimethyl 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene) has been linked to the classic "petrol-like" aroma found in some Riesling wines. Higher concentrations of TDN precursors in grapes has been associated with increased cluster sun exposure. A field trial was undertaken in which fruit zone leaf removal was applied at three different timings. Concentrations of carotenoids and bound and free TDN and other volatiles were quantified in harvested berries and in wines. Leaf removal at 33 -days post-berry set significantly increased zeaxanthin in Riesling grapes mid-season, total TDN and vitispirane in the juice of mature Riesling grapes, and free and total TDN in finished wine, while earlier or later leaf removal had no effect. iv 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
