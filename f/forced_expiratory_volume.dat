5|$|Asthma {{is thought}} to be caused by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry. Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.|$|E
5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E
500|$|Other lung {{function}} tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) {{and flow of}} air that can be inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the vital capacity. In particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (FEV1) {{as a proportion of}} how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive. Another test is that of the lung's [...] diffusing capacity – this {{is a measure of the}} transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of aquatic exercise on pulmonary function of patients with spinal cord injury. [Subjects] The subjects were randomly allocated to an aqua group (n= 10) and a land group (n= 10). [Methods] Both groups trained for 60 minutes, 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Pulmo-nary function was assessed by measuring the forced vital capacity (FVC), <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> flow rate (FER), <b>force</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> at one second (FEV 1) and <b>force</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> at one second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 / FVC).

40|$|It is {{not readily}} {{apparent}} how pulmonary function {{could be improved}} by resecting portions of the lung in patients with emphysema. In emphysema, elevation in residual volume relative to total lung capacity reduces <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volumes,</b> increases inspiratory effort, and impairs inspiratory muscle mechanics. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) better matches {{the size of the}} lungs {{to the size of the}} thorax containing them. This restores <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volumes</b> and the mechanical advantage of the inspiratory muscles. In patients with heterogeneous emphysema, LVRS may also allow space occupied by cysts to be reclaimed by more normal lung. Newer, bronchoscopic methods for lung volume reduction seek to achieve similar ends by causing localized atelectasis, but may be hindered by the low collateral resistance of emphysematous lung. Understanding of the mechanisms of improved function after LVRS can help select patients more likely to benefit from this approach...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{decline in}} {{normalized}} <b>forced</b> 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> after lung transplantation is inevitable; however, {{the effect of}} this change on survival is unknown. Additionally, the benefit of double versus single lung transplant is debated, particularly because pulmonary function is only slightly better after double lung transplant. Our goal was to determine the effect of the temporal pattern of post-transplant <b>forced</b> 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (percentage of predicted) on the risk of death after transplant and the differences in the sensitivity of single and double lung transplant to this relationship. MethodsFrom February 1990 to January 2008, 622 adults underwent lung transplantation, of whom 315 (51 %) received 2 lungs. Of the 509 patients (82 %) with available data, 9471 longitudinal evaluations of <b>forced</b> 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (percentage of predicted) were analyzed. The temporal pattern was characterized for each patient, and the resulting curve was evaluated as a time-varying covariable function in the survival analysis. Differences in sensitivity of single and double lung transplant were assessed by interaction. ResultsForced 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (percentage of predicted) increased from 50 % immediately postoperatively to 55 % at 1 year after single lung transplant and then gradually declined to 47 % by 3 years. Although the pattern was similar after double lung transplant, the corresponding <b>forced</b> 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (percentage of predicted) at these points was greater— 60 %, 75 %, and 65 %. Lower post-transplant <b>forced</b> 1 -second <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> (percentage of predicted) was associated with a substantially increased risk of death after single lung transplant (P < . 0001); however, this increase was far less after double lung transplant (P < . 0001). ConclusionsThe results of our study have demonstrated the effect of changing lung function after lung transplantation on survival. Survival after single lung transplant proved more sensitive to declining pulmonary function, demonstrating an advantage of the increased pulmonary reserve provided by double lung transplant...|$|R

5000|$|In COPD, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in airway resistance, shown by a decrease in the <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> in 1 second (FEV1) measured by spirometry. COPD is defined as a <b>forced</b> <b>expiratory</b> <b>volume</b> in 1 second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) that is less than 0.7. The residual volume, the volume of air left in the lungs following full expiration, is often increased in COPD, as is the total lung capacity, while the vital capacity remains relatively normal. The increased total lung capacity (hyperinflation) can result in the clinical feature of a [...] "barrel chest" [...] - a chest with a large front-to-back diameter that occurs in some individuals with COPD. Hyperinflation can also be seen on a chest x-ray as a flattening of the diaphragm.|$|E

However, the medium term outcome of transplantation in this patient group is unknown.  METHODS—This study was performed to evaluate our experience with lung transplantation for end stage pulmonary sarcoidosis. Between July 1988 and July 1997 12 patients (nine men) underwent lung transplantation for sarcoidosis at our institution. Ten underwent single lung transplantation and two double lung transplantation.  RESULTS—Survival at three and five years was 70 % and 56 %, respectively. Three patients developed obliterative bronchiolitis at six, 18, and 45 months. One died {{at the time of}} retransplantation. Sarcoid granulomas have recurred in the donor organ in three patients. In one the development of granulomas has been associated with clinical deterioration, necessitating retransplantation.
