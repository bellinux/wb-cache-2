Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting <b>expenses</b> of <b>factory,</b> etc. <b>Overheads</b> are also very important cost element along with direct materials and direct labor.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the company's efforts in the <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> cost control efforts and also to determine the efficiency of the company's production costs. In conducting research tool used to analyze the <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> costs are the difference or variance. In analyzing the first <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> costs semivariabel separated into elements of fixed costs and variable costs using the method of highest and lowest point [...] Then proceed with the determination of the <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> cost rates. And the next step is to analyze the <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> costs by using the difference between the budget and the excess capacity. From the results of budget analysis difference can be seen that there are no profitable deviations amounting to Rp 442, 653, 215. 00. This is due to the increase in the cost of repair and maintenance of machines, because machines are used less attention so often damaged as well as rising electricity costs because of inefficient use of electricity. From the analysis of excess capacity results obtained favorable results for USD 2, 254, 015. 00. This is because the available capacity can be used with baik. seningga no idle capacity. In connection with the above conclusion, the author can provide policy advice on the allocation of <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> costs so as not to deviate too much from the budget. Optimize the efficient use of the fixed costs of the available capacity.

The methods employed in this research were direct and indirect interview, and literary study. Furthermore, an evaluation was conducted on the research conducted by comparing the data and the theory. The result of research shows that “Bu Gito” Tofu Factory had collected and calculated the elements of production cost encompassing the raw material, direct labor, and <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> costs in each period. “Bu Gito” Tofu Factory had collected the raw material cost properly by multiplying the amount of material used by the basic price of raw material. “Bu Gito” Tofu Factory had calculated the labor cost properly by multiplying the number of labor by the number of work days and the predefined daily wage tariff. However, there are still some weaknesses the determination of production basic price in “Bu Gito” Tofu Factory: (1) there is no separation between the production cost and non-production cost, (2) for the <b>factory</b> <b>overhead</b> cost, “Bu Gito” Tofu Factory only calculates the actual cost spent with the cash.

It is generally agreed that a strong and healthy banking system is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. Banks in Sri Lanka have been undergoing major challenges in the dynamic environment over the past few years. In order to resist negative shocks and maintain financial stability, it is important to identify the determinants that mostly influence the overall performance of banks in Sri Lanka. This study aims to give the analysis of the determinants of commercial banks profitability in Sri Lanka over the period 2001 - 2010. The focus is on the internal factors only. This paper uses the multiple regression analysis method to investigate the impact of capital ratio, credit risk, activity mix, size and <b>overhead</b> <b>expense</b> on profitability indicator return on asset(ROA). The empirical results have found strong evidence that the severable have a strong Influence on the profitability. However, there sults show the higher capital ratio may not necessarily lead to higher profits. Also higher assets contribute towards profitability, credit risk is strongly negative with profitability, when bank of Ceylon invest their capital in diverse options it could earn more profit because of activity mix has a positive relationship with profitability, and finally <b>overhead</b> <b>expenses</b> weakly negative relationship with profitability. This is indicating bank expenses are efficiently allocated to earn much more profit. Most of the situations about <b>overhead</b> <b>expenses</b> are going to heavy negative relationship with profitability, by wastage of expenses.
