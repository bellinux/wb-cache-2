Nations with less than three runners were disregarded for the team event and their runners competed for the individual prizes only.|$|E

The following year, he was selected for four first-class matches, one of which was against the touring West Indies. He also officiated in his first List A match, presiding over the final of Australia's domestic limited-overs tournament, which Queensland hosted against Western Australia. The following two seasons were similar; Harvey stood in four first-class matches including one against a touring <b>international</b> <b>team,</b> and one List A match, both of which were quarter-finals.|$|E

5|$|From 1961 to 1967, he was {{a leading}} member of a strong Scottish <b>international</b> <b>team</b> that lost only once to England, in 1965, shortly after he {{recovered}} from the leg fracture. He thought his best international performance was a 2–1 win against England in 1963, when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players. In the 1967 match against England, who had won the 1966 World Cup, he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his teammates to find good positions. Although he was given most {{of the credit for}} the 3–2 win, some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score.|$|E

The previous year, Bangladesh had claimed their first Test series victory against a senior Test nation, though it came against a West Indies side that was heavily weakened because of an industrial dispute. England came into the tour {{on the back of a}} two-and-a-half-month series against South Africa in which they had tied the Test and Twenty20 International series, and secured a 2–1 ODI series win.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{have only}} ever been beaten by six test nations, {{and they are}} the only <b>international</b> <b>team</b> to have a winning record against every nation they have played.

Since World Rankings were {{introduced}} by World Rugby in October 2003, New Zealand have occupied the number one ranking the majority of the time.

5|$|Since Scotland's first {{international}} association football match on 30 November 1872, 30 players have scored three goals (a hat-trick) {{or more in}} a game.

5|$|The men's tournament {{was first}} {{held at the}} 1920 Summer Olympics and {{integrated}} in the Winter Olympic program starting with the 1924 Winter Olympics. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the NHL and other professional leagues {{were not allowed to}} play. Canada dominated the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. The Soviet Union first participated in 1956, and overtook Canada as the dominant <b>international</b> <b>team,</b> winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The only two tournaments that the Soviets failed to win, in 1960 and 1980, were hosted and won by the United States. Other nations to win gold include Great Britain in 1936, Sweden in 1994 and 2006, and the Czech Republic in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Wales did not field an <b>international</b> <b>team</b> {{until the}} IRFB, {{supported}} by the RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898. The WFU agreed that they would in future abide by all IRFB by-laws, and that Gould {{not be allowed to}} play in any future internationals. Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise prevented a long term split in the sport, and by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.|$|E
