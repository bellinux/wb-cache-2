50|$|The large {{cross section}} of the holes in the {{spectacle}} plate means that with a <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter of e.g. 200 mm it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as 80 mm. The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the delivery line - in this example this would be 120 mm.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-density}} solids pumps {{which can}} be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> and into the delivery line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steel housing}} {{of the seat}} valve pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{element of}} the transfer tube pump is the so-called [...] "S" [...] transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material {{is connected to the}} delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.|$|E
5000|$|With a single-{{cylinder}} {{piston pump}} the medium is [...] "stuffed" [...] {{out of a}} feed chute into the <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending {{on the level of}} the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, {{oxygen therapy}} is {{becoming}} more and more accessible. When oxygen is needed for short periods or for special indications as palliative care, an agreement between mutual insurance companies and pharmacists allows the practitioner the home istallation of gazeous oxygen cylinder or of oxygen concentrator. When long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is indicated for patients with respiratory insufficiency, the pneumologist must first ask the INAMI the authorization to install one of the following modalities :oxygen concentrator with or without demand oxygen <b>delivery</b> <b>cylinder</b> and liquid oxygen. The goal of LTOT is to increase survival and quality of life. The principal and well accepted indication for LTOT is severe hypoxemia. The beneficial effects of oxygen therapy limited at night or on exertion are controversial. In order to increase patient's autonomy, oxygen can be prescribed for ambulation, respecting prescription's rules. At each step of oxygen therapy implementing (indication, choice of the device and follow-up) the patient under oxygen may benefit from a joint approach between the general practitioner and the chest specialist.

25|$|The main flaw {{associated}} with delivering gas via artillery was {{the difficulty of}} achieving a killing concentration.

40|$|Non-delivery” home oxygen {{technologies}} that allow self-filling of ambulatory oxygen cylinders are emerging. They {{can offer a}} relatively unlimited supply of ambulatory oxygen in suitably assessed people who require long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), providing they can use these systems safely and effectively. This allows users to be self-sufficient and facilitates {{longer periods of time}} away from home. The evolution and evidence base of this technology is reported with the experience of a national service review in Scotland (UK). Given that domiciliary oxygen services represent a significant cost to healthcare providers globally, these systems offer potential cost savings, are appealing to remote and rural regions due to the avoidance of <b>cylinder</b> <b>delivery</b> and have additional lower environmental impact due to reduced fossil fuel consumption and subsequently reduced carbon emissions. Evidence is emerging that self-fill/non-delivery oxygen systems can meet the ambulatory oxygen needs of many patients using LTOT and can {{have a positive impact on}} quality of life, increase time spent away from home and offer significant financial savings to healthcare providers. Educational aims Provide update for oxygen prescribers on options for home oxygen provision.; Provide update on the evidence base for available self-fill oxygen technologies.; Provide and update for healthcare commissioners on the potential cost-effective and environmental benefits of increased utilisation of self-fill oxygen systems. ...|$|R
5000|$|The PRR {{began to}} develop steam {{locomotives}} again in the mid-to-late 1930s, but with a difference. Where previous PRR locomotive policy had been conservative, new radical designs took hold. Designers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the PRR's longtime development partner, were eager to prove the viability of steam {{in the face of}} new competition from Diesel-electric locomotives, and persuaded the railroad to adopt Baldwin's latest idea: the duplex locomotive. This split the locomotive's driving wheels into two sets, each with its own pair of cylinders and rods. Previously, the only locomotives with two sets of drivers were articulated locomotives, but the duplex used one rigid frame. In a duplex design, cylinders could be smaller and the weight of side and main rods could be drastically reduced. Given that the movement of the main rod could not be fully balanced, the duplex design would reduce [...] "hammer blow" [...] on the track. The lower reciprocating mass meant that higher speeds could be achieved. Use of poppet valves also increased the speed because they gave very accurately-timed steam <b>delivery</b> to the <b>cylinders.</b> However, there was a drawback of the metallurgy used; the poppet valve could not take the stress of sustained high speed operation (meaning over 100 mi/h km/h on production T1s).|$|R
5000|$|Vickers {{pioneered the}} use of common rail {{injection}} in submarine engines. Vickers engines with the common rail fuel system were first used in 1916 in the G-class submarines. It used four plunger pumps to deliver a pressure of up to [...] every 90 degrees of rotation to keep the fuel pressure adequately constant in the rail. Fuel <b>delivery</b> to individual <b>cylinders</b> could be shut off via valves in the injector lines. Doxford Engines used a common rail system in their opposed-piston marine engines from 1921 to 1980, where a multi-cylinder reciprocating fuel pump generated a pressure of approximately , with the fuel being stored in accumulator bottles. [...] Pressure control was achieved {{by means of an}} adjustable pump discharge stroke and a [...] "spill valve". Camshaft-operated mechanical timing valves were used to supply the spring-loaded Brice/CAV/Lucas injectors, which injected through the side of the cylinder into the chamber formed between the pistons. Early engines had a pair of timing cams, one for ahead running and one for astern. Later engines had two injectors per cylinder, and the final series of constant-pressure turbocharged engines were fitted with four injectors per cylinder. This system was used for the injection of both diesel oil and heavy fuel oil (600cSt heated to a temperature of approximately 130 °C).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{patients}} on long-term oxygen therapy use stationary oxygen delivery systems. It {{is not uncommon}} for guidelines to instruct patients to use tubing lengths no longer than 19. 68 ft (6 m) when using an oxygen concentrator and 49. 21 ft (15 m) when using cylinders. However, these concepts are not based on sufficient evidence. Thus, our objective was to evaluate whether a 98. 42 -ft (30 -m) tubing length affects oxygen flow and FIO 2 <b>delivery</b> from 1 <b>cylinder</b> and 2 oxygen concentrators. METHODS: the 3 oxygen delivery systems were randomly selected, and 1, 3, and 5 L/min flows and Floz were measured 5 times at each flow at the proximal and distal outlets of the tubing by a gas-flow analyzer. Paired Student (test was used to analyze the difference between flows and FIO 2 at proximal and distal outlets of tubing length. RESULTS: A total of 45 flows were measured between proximal and distal outlets of the 98. 42 -ft (30 -m) tubing. Flows were similar for 1 and 3 L/min, but distal flow was higher than proximal flow at 5 L/min (5. 57 x 5. 14 L/min, P <. 001). FIO 2 was lower at distal than proximal outlet tubing at flows 1, 3, and 5 L/min, but the mean difference between measurements was less than 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: Tubing length of 98. 42 ft (30 m) may be used by patients for home delivery oxygen with flows up to 5 L/min, as there were no important changes in flows or FIO 2.
