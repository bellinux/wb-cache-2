25|$|In this example, {{the general}} <b>deliverables</b> within an {{implementation}} of software are mentioned, executed and delivered differently {{as time goes}} by, mainly because of dependencies between <b>deliverables.</b> For instance, the actual go for the delivery of the software and the other related <b>deliverables</b> are dependent {{on the outcome of}} the deliverable “Proeftuin”. “Proeftuin” is an agreed period in which the software is extensively tested by the customer organization, provided and supported by the supplier.

25|$|It may be {{difficult}} in this early stage of the ISPL process to thoroughly identify the service domain though, because {{it may be that}} external suppliers will be attracted to deliver some of the <b>deliverables.</b> External suppliers are, at this point unknown.

25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{acquisition}} goal, which contains among others the systems and services requirements and descriptions, scenarios can be formed for the deliveries of the information services to be acquired.

25|$|In May 2010 and December 2010, {{soldiers}} of the 560th worked specifically with the Ugandan army {{to set up a}} military decision making process (MDMP) training event. The idea was to familiarize the Ugandans with U.S. Army Light Infantry MDMP at the tactical battalion level. Uganda’s military is highly interested in understanding how the American Army conducts the MDMP based on their operational lessons learned in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. The seminar assisted the process by establishing a basic understanding of roles and responsibilities of a light infantry battalion staff in the MDMP process, MDMP timelines and sequence of events, products or <b>deliverables,</b> and an understanding of how this product aids the field commander. This, in turn, set the foundation for a follow-on MDMP, which will familiarize the Ugandan army with the light infantry decision making process at the brigade level. Such training events also help the U.S. by enhancing awareness in the U.S. military of Ugandan infantry battalion practices, thereby improving interoperability. They also elicit lessons learned from the audience’s peacekeeping operations.|$|E

In January 2016, Rooney Mara revealed that an intimate scene between Therese and Richard was also deleted. Editor Affonso Gonçalves stated that the initial cut was two and a half hours and the final cut ended at 118 minutes. Todd Haynes explained in an October 2015 interview: [...] "We cut a lot of scenes; it was too long, and they were all well-performed and nicely shot—we never, in my opinion, cut things because they were poorly executed. It was just a paring-down process, which all movies do." ...|$|E

This <b>deliverable</b> therefore represents the complement of <b>Deliverable</b> D 13. Specifically, D 13 presents the MobileMAN architecture and protocols, while in this <b>deliverable</b> the solutions we devised are validated. Whenever possible, our evaluations are based on measurements from real small- medium-size testbeds. In addition, simulation results are used to study large scale networks and/or complex mobility scenarios. Results are presented by following a bottom up approach from wireless technologies up to the applications. The <b>deliverable</b> also investigates the behavior and performance of a medium-scale MobileMAN network made of (up to) 23 nodes.
