30|$|The {{abatement}} {{performance of}} biofiltration reactors {{relies heavily on}} the biofilm formed {{on the surface of}} packing materials (Acuña et al. 2002). Biofilm formation allows a microbial lifestyle that is entirely different from the planktonic state (Flemming and Wingender 2010). The formation of mature biofilm on various surfaces is a major consideration when running biological reactors in discontinuous mode since some of the attached cells can detach from the surface during the <b>idle</b> <b>phase</b> and return to the planktonic form. In this situation, biofilm formation is extremely difficult. Microorganisms differ greatly in their ability to form biofilm or to degrade pollutants (Lee et al. 2009; Alinejad et al. 2017).

Furthermore, the service times are not necessarily deterministic but can diverge significantly, due to two effects: First, the schedule itself might be irregular, for example if multiple subsequent transmission slots are followed by a large <b>idle</b> <b>phase.</b> Secondly, even if the schedule is regular, the service time of packet that arrives at an empty queue is not constant, but depends on the time left until the next transmission slot.

In fact, each user {{is associated with}} a traffic generator that alternates between an activity phase (ON phase, browsing time) and an <b>idle</b> <b>phase</b> (OFF phase, reading time). During the activity phase objects are downloaded at exponentially distributed intervals with mean value 1 /µa. An object is an HTML document or a related file (e. g., an image). The number of objects requested per activity phase is geometrically distributed with mean value No. The sojourn time in the <b>idle</b> <b>phase</b> (no traffic is produced) is exponentially distributed with mean value 1 /µid. It is easy to show that also the sojourn time in the activity phase is exponentially distributed, so that the generator is a 2 -state Markov Modulated Poisson Process (2 -MMPP) [1]; during the browsing time, the arrival process is Poisson with a variable message length. See Figure 1. Fig. 1.

The length of an object in bytes, lb, is defined as: lb = bXc (2) being b. c the floor function.

40|$|AbstractElectrochemical ammonia {{oxidation}} {{has gained}} {{a lot of attention}} recently as an efficient method for ammonia removal from wastewater, for the use in ammonia-based fuel cells and the production of high purity hydrogen. Thermally decomposed iridium oxide films (TDIROF) {{have been shown to be}} catalytically active for direct ammonia oxidation in aqueous solutions if NH 3 is present. However, the process was reported to be rapidly inhibited on TDIROF. Herein, we show that this fast inhibition of direct ammonia oxidation does not result from surface poisoning by adsorbed elemental nitrogen (Nads). Instead, we propose that direct ammonia oxidation and oxygen evolution can lead to a drop of the local pH at the electrode resulting in a low availability of the actual reactant, NH 3. The hypothesis was tested with cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments on stagnant and rotating disk electrodes (RDE). The CV experiments on the stagnant electrode revealed that the decrease of the ammonia oxidation peaks was considerably reduced by introducing an <b>idle</b> <b>phase</b> at open circuit potential between subsequent scans. Furthermore, the polarization of the TDIROF electrode into the hydrogen evolution region (HER) resulted in increased ammonia oxidation peaks in the following anodic scans which can be explained with an increased local pH after the consumption of protons in the HER. On the RDE, the ammonia oxidation peaks did not decrease in immediately consecutive scans. These findings would not be expected if surface poisoning was responsible for the fast inhibition but they are in good agreement with the proposed mechanism of pH induced limitation by the reactant, NH 3. The plausibility of the mechanism was also supported by our numerical simulations of the processes in the Nernstian diffusion layer. The knowledge about this inhibition mechanism of direct ammonia oxidation is especially important for the design of electrochemical cells for wastewater treatment. The mechanism is not only valid for TDIROF but also for other electrodes because it is independent of the electrode material...|$|E

Shrinking feature sizes in CMOS-based technology beyond the 45 nm regime have {{given rise to}} increased levels of variation in digital circuits and architectures due to process, temperature, and aging effects. The fabrication process induces variations in the process parameters, causing differing levels of perturbation in the circuit delay in each manufactured part at the postsilicon stage. Moreover, after manufacturing, during the normal operation of a chip, new variations are injected due to various aging mechanisms, particularly Bias Temperature Instability (BTI). These effects cause long-term degradations in transistor performance, resulting in temporal delay degradations at the circuit level. The mechanism of BTI is exacerbated as transistor sizes reduce, and poses a growing threat to circuit reliability. All of these effects poses significant challenges at the presilicon design stage, which must ensure correct and reliable performance of a chip throughout its lifetime. Hence, techniques to mitigate the effects of spatial and temporal variations have become {{a vital part of the}} design flow for digital circuits and architectures. In this thesis, we develop robust techniques, in the form of design tools and techniques that operate at the circuit and architectural levels, which can be used to analyze, compensate and mitigate various sources of variation, including process and temperature variations and BTI-induced aging. One significant problem is related to the issue of performing presilicon timing analysis. State-of-the-art timing tools are built around the use of current source models (CSMs), which have proven to be fast and accurate in enabling the analysis of large circuits. As circuits become increasingly exposed to process and temperature variations, there is a strong need to augment these models to account for thermal effects and for the impact of adaptive body biasing, a compensatory technique that is used to overcome on-chip variations. However, a straightforward extension of CSMs to incorporate timing analysis at multiple body biases and temperatures results in unreasonably large characterization tables for each cell. The first contribution of this thesis is to propose a new approach to compactly capture body bias and temperature effects within a mainstream CSM framework. Our approach features a table reduction method for compaction of tables and a fast and novel waveform sensitivity method for timing evaluation under any body bias and temperature condition. The next part of the thesis addresses the problem of designing a new form of logic circuit, known as a variable latency unit. The basic idea, proposed in prior research, is an alternative to the conventional one-cycle implementation of circuits. Variable latency units (VLUs) allow a circuit to complete its operation in either one or multiple (typically, two) clock cycles, depending on the input provided to the circuit. This is facilitated through the use of hold logic, which holds the clock for an extra cycle when certain input patterns are applied. Our second contribution develops VLU-based BTI-aware designs, with a novel scheme for multioutput hold logic implementation for VLUs. A key observation is the identification and exploitation of specific supersetting patterns in the two-dimensional space of frequency and aging of the circuit. The multioutput hold logic scheme is used in conjunction with an adaptive body bias framework to achieve high performance. VLUs may experience functional incorrectness due to process variations. In our third contribution, we develop an efficient, combined presilicon-postsilicon statistical technique for variation aware VLU design. We develop a set of hold logics that ensure functional correctness of the circuit across all manufactured chips. This is achieved by exploiting spatial correlations to cluster such paths in the circuit, that get affected by process variations in very similar ways. Since such clusters are quite few in number, the corresponding set of hold logics is also small. Our final contribution presents a novel scheme for saving architectural power by mitigating BTI in digital circuits, inspired by the notion of human circadian rhythms. The method works in two alternating phases. In the first, the compute phase, the circuit is "awake" and active, operating briskly at a greater-than-nominal supply voltage, which causes tasks to complete more quickly.

This paper is a consequence of a study on assessing the cold-starting performance of a compression ignition engine fueled with different blends of fossil diesel fuel and biodiesel.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} fuel consumption and the tailpipe emissions of a vehicle, standard driving cycles {{are used to}} prescribe vehicle driving conditions such as speed, gear shifts, fluid temperature etc. The new European Driving Cycle (NEDC) has been widely used as a driving cycle for emissions and fuel consumption while the Federal Test Procedure 75 (FTP- 75) mode {{is used in the}} United States. In South Korea, the NEDC is applied for emission certification and the FTP- 75 mode is used for the fuel consumption of a vehicle powered by a diesel engine. Because these driving cycles contain a mix of static <b>phase</b> (cruising and <b>idle)</b> and transient <b>phase</b> (acceleration and deceleration), they need to be translted to static engine operation conditions so that optimization is possible using an engine dynamometer for each representative engine operation condition. This study set up two models to convert vehicle driving conditions to engine operation conditions based on the work which the engine should produce to follow the driving cycle, and based on the representative vehicle speeds of the NEDC. The accuracy of each model was compared with actual vehicle test results on a chassis dynamometer, and the characteristics of each model were analyzed...|$|R
