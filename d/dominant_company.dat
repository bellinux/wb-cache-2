25|$|The Iron Workers Union {{was formed}} in 1896. As the work was {{seasonal}} and most iron workers were unskilled, the union remained weak, {{and much of the}} industry remained unorganized until 1902. That year, the union won a strike against the American Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the newly formed U.S. Steel corporation. American Bridge was the <b>dominant</b> <b>company</b> in the iron industry, and within a year the Iron Workers Union had not only organized almost every United States iron manufacturer, but had also won signed contracts including union shop clauses. The McNamara brothers were Irish American trade unionists. John (known as J.J.) and his younger brother James (known as J.B.) were both active in the International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers (the Iron Workers).|$|E
25|$|Charles Ranlett Flint who had {{engineered}} the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) {{found it difficult}} to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914 when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. Eleven months later he was made president when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a <b>dominant</b> <b>company</b> that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM's revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, the WWF (renamed [...] "World Wrestling Entertainment" [...] {{to avoid}} a {{trademark}} dispute with the World Wildlife Fund in 2002 and becoming simply [...] "WWE" [...] in 2011) became the <b>dominant</b> <b>company</b> in the global professional wrestling industry {{with the end of}} its two leading competitors, WCW and ECW. ECW was in dire financial straits earlier that year and Heyman filed for bankruptcy on April 4, 2001. WCW continued to lose more money and finally ended on March 23, 2001 with McMahon buying out the promotion, after more than 15 years in business and being the biggest threat to the WWF to date. This left professional wrestling fans with no alternative to WWF programming and led to some leaving the fandom.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{market concentration}} and stock returns on the Australian Securities Exchange. We find that <b>dominant</b> <b>companies</b> operating in concentrated industries in Australia {{are able to}} generate significant risk-adjusted excess stock returns. Our results for Australian data are opposite to that found by Hou and Robinson (2006) for United States market data. Hou and Robinson reason that United States firms which operate in concentrated industries are insulated from competitive pressures, have lower levels of innovation (Arrow, 1962) and therefore experience lower profitability and stock returns. By contrast, the Australian data show a significant and positive relationship between concentration and innovation expenditure. Therefore, the excess stock returns of <b>dominant</b> <b>companies</b> in Australia are {{consistent with previous research}} linking innovation expenditure with excess stock returns. We hypothesize that the apparent contradiction of our results compared with Hou and Robinson (2006) for the United States market is resolved by an examination of the differences in size and competition in United States and Australian industries and the consequent differential ability of <b>dominant</b> <b>companies</b> in the two countries to generate monopoly rents and invest in ‘Schumpeterian’ (Schumpeter, 1942) innovation. 24 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{investors have}} a {{significant}} share in Polish banking system (about 66 % share in assets of the banking sector). This situation is often criticised by the opponents of such a big share of foreign investments in Polish banking sector. The fears are expressed that foreign investors can limit credits for Polish people and enterprises and transfer capital from their subsidiaries to the <b>dominant</b> <b>companies,</b> especially {{in the period of}} crisis in the financial market. This problem has been examined in this article. In {{the first part of the}} text the property structure of Polish banking sector has been presented. Because the important terms for this text (such as a bank, credit institution, financial institution) are differently defined according to the Polish law and European Union law the second part of this article has been dedicated to this problem. In its third part the behaviour of foreign banks and branches of credit institutions on Polish banking market in 2007 – 2011 has been analysed. The conclusion is that foreign <b>dominant</b> <b>companies</b> did not transfer capital from their subsidiaries. On the contrary they made a contribution to the funds of their subsidiaries. The <b>dominant</b> <b>companies</b> also did not limit the credit action to a degree exceeding the normal procedure in crisis situations. Finally, there follows the critical analysis of the concept of governmental institutions’ support of buying-back foreign banks by Polish capital or foreign-Polish capital...|$|R
