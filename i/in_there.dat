5|$|Among the {{inconsistencies}} {{was whether}} the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves <b>in.)</b> <b>There</b> was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E

So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|Downstream from {{confluence}} of the Drina, the Sava River changes its eastward course to northeast, until it reaches Sremska Mitrovica, from where it flows to the southeast and then south to Šabac, before finally turning east towards Belgrade. Most of the river's course in Serbia represents a border between province of Vojvodina, on the left bank, and Central Serbia, on the right bank. Exceptions to that are in area around Sremska Mitrovica, where both banks are in Vojvodina, and downstream of Progar suburb of Belgrade where both banks are in Central Serbia. The river meanders and forms wetlands <b>in</b> <b>there</b> as well—the most significant wetland among them centering on Obedska bara oxbow lake. The Sava River forms several large islands in this segment of the course, with the largest among them— Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade—connected to the right bank {{by a pair of}} artificial embankment dams forming Lake Sava since 1967.|$|E

5|$|Restoration {{of most of}} {{the canal}} does not present major problems, but {{challenges}} are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 {{to the north of the}} canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.|$|E
