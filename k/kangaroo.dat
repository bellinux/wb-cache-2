5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on <b>Kangaroo</b> Island, {{and has been}} separated from the mainland subspecies for around 9000 years. Birds of this subspecies are larger, have narrower bills and darker plumage than birds on nearby mainland South Australia. Females from <b>Kangaroo</b> Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds.|$|E
5|$|The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews coined further {{names in}} the early 1910s, {{including}} a new genus name, Peronista, as he believed the King and <b>Kangaroo</b> Island birds were generically distinct from the mainland emu. Later writers claimed that the subfossil remains found on King and <b>Kangaroo</b> Islands were not discernibly different, and that they therefore belonged to the same taxon. In 1959, the French ornithologist Christian Jouanin proposed {{that none of the}} skins were actually from <b>Kangaroo</b> Island, after inspecting expedition and museum documents. In 1990, Jouanin and Jean-Christophe Balouet used environmental forensics to demonstrate that the mounted skin in Paris came from King Island, and that at least one live bird had been brought from each island. All scientific names given to the <b>Kangaroo</b> Island emu were therefore based on specimens from King Island or were otherwise invalid, leaving it nameless. More recent finds of subfossil material and subsequent studies on King and <b>Kangaroo</b> Island emu, notably by Shane A. Parker in 1984, confirmed their separate geographic origin and distinct morphology. Parker named the <b>Kangaroo</b> Island bird Dromaiusbaudinianus, after Nicolas Baudin, the leader of the French expedition. The name Dromaius ater was kept for the King Island emu.|$|E

40|$|Between 1980 - 1982 much of Australia was {{surveyed}} {{from the}} air to estimate density and distribution of <b>kangaroos.</b> Numbers were estimated as 8. 3 million red <b>kangaroos</b> Macropus rufus, 1. 8 million 'western' grey <b>kangaroos</b> M. fuliginosus and 5. 0 million eastern grey <b>kangaroos</b> M. giganteus.

40|$|Density {{distributions}} {{of red and}} western grey <b>kangaroos</b> in the South Australian pastoral zone were determined for the period 1978 - 86. The habitat associations of these <b>kangaroos</b> were analysed using the densities on half-degree blocks, and information on landform and soil type, land use and degradation, vegetation, and climate. Red <b>kangaroos</b> were found throughout the pastoral zone, the highest densities being in the north-east. Western grey <b>kangaroos</b> were restricted to the southern parts of the pastoral zone. Higher densities of red <b>kangaroos</b> were associated with pastoral land use, with brown calcareous and red duplex soils, and with areas dominated by low bluebush shrublands. They were not particularly closely associated with areas dominated by mulga. Habitat associations of red <b>kangaroos</b> were different in drought years compared to non-drought years. Changes in density distribution during drought {{appear to have been}} due to the patchiness of rainfall. The relative effect of the drought was greatest {{in the northern part of}} the pastoral zone. Outside this effect, recent rainfall was found to be of only secondary importance to the overall density distribution of red <b>kangaroos.</b> Climatic factors appeared to be the major determinants of the density distribution of western grey <b>kangaroos.</b> Low evaporation and relatively high rainfall characterised areas with high densities of western grey <b>kangaroos.</b> As was the case with red <b>kangaroos,</b> habitat heterogeneity appeared to be an important requirement of western grey <b>kangaroos.</b> Also, habitat associations were different in drought and non-drought years. Despite this, as was the case with red <b>kangaroos,</b> recent rainfall was only of secondary importance to the overall distribution of western grey <b>kangaroos...</b>|$|R

5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, {{this could have been}} because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed <b>kangaroo</b> paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green <b>kangaroo</b> paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330mm (13in) long, and the femur was 180mm (7in) long. The pelvis was 280mm (11in) long, 64mm (2.5in) wide at the front, and 86mm (3in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus {{averaged}} 232mm (9in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the <b>Kangaroo</b> Island emu. Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the <b>Kangaroo</b> Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the <b>Kangaroo</b> Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} Dromaius {{species were}} present in Australia {{at the time of}} European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, D. baudinianus and D. n. minor, originally present on <b>Kangaroo</b> Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. D. n. diemenensis, a subspecies known as the Tasmanian emu, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland sub-species, D. n. novaehollandiae, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and <b>Kangaroo</b> Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. While the Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s, more birds have since been introduced, and attempts are being made to breed a form similar to the Tasmanian emu. The <b>Kangaroo</b> Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.|$|E

5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on <b>Kangaroo</b> Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from <b>Kangaroo</b> Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E

5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on the horizon and {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit.

Pressing on sail in pursuit, Newman ordered HMS Révolutionaire to focus on Sémillante whilst he pursued Loire in HMS Mermaid, accompanied by the brig HMS <b>Kangaroo</b> under Commander Edward Brace. Loire and Sémillante separated to divide their pursuers; Mermaid and <b>Kangaroo</b> lost track of Loire in the early evening, and Sémillante evaded Révolutionaire after dark.|$|E
