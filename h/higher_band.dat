40|$|A novel {{approach}} is proposed for effective high frequency regeneration in audio coding, {{which is based}} on a sinusoids plus noise model. It assumes a standard high efficiency advanced audio coding (HE-AAC) encoder, and modifies the decoder to exploit all available information in estimating the model parameters. From the lower band reconstruction of core AAC, frequency parameters of the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> sinusoids are estimated. Side information about spectral energy and the regenerated <b>high</b> <b>band</b> of standard HE-AAC are employed in estimating the magnitude parameters of the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> sinusoids as well as noise model parameters.

5000|$|Bandwidth {{extension}} {{has been}} used in both speech and audio compression applications. The algorithms used in G.729.1 and Spectral Band Replication (SBR) are two of many examples of bandwidth extension algorithms currently in use. In these methods, the low band of the spectrum is encoded using an existing codec, whereas the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> is coarsely parameterized using fewer parameters. Many of these bandwidth extension algorithms make use of the correlation between the low <b>band</b> and the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> in order to predict the wider band signal from extracted lower-band features. Others encode the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> using very few bits. This is often sufficient since the ear is less sensitive to distortions in the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> compared to the low band.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an image denoising algorithm, which applies bilateral filtering (BLF) in the Laplacian subbands. It is {{noted that the}} subband images have wider area of photometric similarity than the original, and hence, they can be more benefited by the BLF than the original. Specifically, an image is Gaussian filtered to obtain a low band image, and the low band image is subtracted from the original to have the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> signal, which forms the Laplacian subbands. For the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> image denoising, we derive an adaptive kernel that {{is dependent on the}} edge intensity and photometric similarity of subband images. The <b>high</b> <b>band</b> image is convolved with this kernel and then added to the denoised low band signal, which produces the denoised image. We also propose to process the denoised <b>high</b> <b>band</b> signal by the gradient histogram preservation method, for sharpening the edges with less noise amplification. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising method provides higher PSNR than the original BLF and other multi-resolution denoising algorithms. Since the <b>high</b> <b>band</b> image is also effectively denoised in this process, the sharpened image by <b>high</b> <b>band</b> modification is also visually more pleasing when compared with the results of the conventional sharpening methods.|$|R

50|$|The {{band gap}} of borocarbonitrides range from 1.0-3.9eV and is {{dependent}} on the content of the carbon and boron nitride domains as they have different electrical properties. Borocarbonitrides with a high carbon content have lower bandgaps whereas those with higher content of boron nitride domains have <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> gaps. Borocarbonitrides synthesized in gas or solid reactions also tend to have large bandgaps and are more insulating in character. The wide range of composition of boronitrides allows for the tuning of the bandgap, which when coupled with its high surface area and Stone-Wales defects may make boronitrides a promising material in electrical devices.|$|E

50|$|Many {{compound}} semiconductors, e.g. those combining {{elements from}} groups III and V or from groups II and VI of the periodic table, crystallize in the fcc zincblende or hcp wurtzite crystal structures. In a semiconductor crystal, the fcc and hcp phases {{of a given}} material will usually have different band gap energies.

In the opposite case (<b>higher</b> <b>band</b> gap in the stacking fault), it constitutes an energy barrier in the band structure of the crystal that can affect the current transport in semiconductor devices.|$|E

50|$|Graphene {{boron nitride}} nanohybrid {{materials}} are created through synthetic {{methods such as}} electron beam welding and chemical vapor deposition. Various different heterostructures of graphene and boron nitride can be assembled. Due to their isostructural, nearly lattice matched and isoelectronic properties, they can form a two-dimensional interface with a line boundary separating the structures. Other unique structures include boron nitride coated carbon nanotubes, and double layers of graphene joined in a pillared fashion by a boron nitride nanotube. The junction created by this stacking arrangement can result in two different junction configurations: one symmetric junction with two heptagonal rings and one asymmetric junction with three octagonal rings. Comparing the two configurations, the octagonal junction {{seems to be more}} stable due to higher pi-pi stacking interactions which induces orbital overlap and mixing between the C atoms of the graphene. This introduces a <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> gap, which indicates more effective insulating properties.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} and {{study has been}} done in utilizing an organic solar cell as the top cell in a hybrid tandem solar cell stack. Because organic solar cells have a <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> gap than traditional inorganic photovoltaics like silicon or CIGS, they can absorb higher energy photons without losing much of the energy due to thermalization, and thus operate at a higher voltage. The lower energy photons and higher energy photons that are unabsorbed pass through the top organic solar cell and are then absorbed by the bottom inorganic cell. Organic solar cells are also solution processible at low temperatures with a low cost of 10 dollars per square meter, resulting in a printable top cell that improves the overall efficiencies of existing, inorganic solar cell technologies. Much research has been done to enable the formation of such a hybrid tandem solar cell stack, including research in the deposition of semi-transparent electrodes that maintain low contact resistance while having high transparency.|$|E
5000|$|The FTL {{hyperspace}} {{propulsion system}} in the stories is around 600 {{years old at the}} time period in which the novels are placed. This technology uses the ability to [...] "sail" [...] along a vast network of [...] "gravity waves" [...] on different successively higher hyperbands, each <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> giving a more-efficient speed multiplier but requiring more powerful (therefore bulkier and more expensive) engines to reach; the higher bands significantly shortening transit times on a given gravity wave for a given base speed, which is limited by particle densities and radiation shielding as Newtonian speeds increase. Analogous to prevailing winds creating certain favoured trade routes, the relatively static fixed gravity waves form favoured travel paths. A lack of gravity waves in some regions means that they must be plodded across by relatively slower means. These favorite routes and desert crossing points are susceptible to illegitimate exploitation by pirates and commerce-raiding warships, both interested in preying on the rich pickings of the interstellar merchant cargo ships that carry upwards of 2-7 million metric tonnes of cargo.|$|E

50|$|Using the 5 GHz band gives 802.11a a {{significant}} advantage, since the 2.4 GHz band is heavily {{used to the}} point of being crowded. Degradation caused by such conflicts can cause frequent dropped connections and degradation of service. However, this high carrier frequency also brings a slight disadvantage: The effective overall range of 802.11a is slightly less than that of 802.11b/g; 802.11a signals cannot penetrate as far as those for 802.11b because they are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path and because the path loss in signal strength is proportional to the square of the signal frequency. On the other hand, OFDM has fundamental propagation advantages when in a high multipath environment, such as an indoor office, and the higher frequencies enable the building of smaller antennas with higher RF system gain which counteract the disadvantage of a <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> of operation. The increased number of usable channels (4 to 8 times as many in FCC countries) and the near absence of other interfering systems (microwave ovens, cordless phones, baby monitors) give 802.11{{a significant}} aggregate bandwidth and reliability advantages over 802.11b/g.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{frequency allocation}} in North America used by Edwin Armstrong used the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation {{was changed to}} a <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center frequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The frequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz), is used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio tuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7 MHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (±10 kHz) could be received, such as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of digital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant when the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down or convert to digital by September 2015—but there are still analog television stations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also analog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.|$|E
50|$|Halmann {{had first}} shown CO2 {{photoreduction}} to formic acid on p-GaP as photocathode in aqueous media in 1978. Apart from several other reports of CO2 photoreduction on p-GaP, {{there are other}} p-type semiconductors like p-GaAs, p-InP, p-CdTe, and p+/p-Si have been successfully used for photoreduction of CO2. The lowest potential for CO2 photoreduction was observed on p-GaP. This {{may be due to}} high photovoltage excepted from <b>higher</b> <b>band</b> gap p-GaP (2.2 eV) photocathode. Apart from formic acid, other products observed for CO2 photoreduction are formaldehyde, methanol and carbon monoxide. On p-GaP, p-GaAs and p+/p-Si photocathode, the main product is formic acid with small amount of formaldehyde and methanol. However, for p-InP and p-CdTe photocathode, both carbon monoxide and formic acid are observed in similar quantities. Mechanism proposed by Hori based on CO2 reduction on metal electrodes predicts formation of both formic acid (in case of no adsorption of singly reduced CO2●− radical anion to the surface) and carbon monoxide (in case of adsorption of singly reduced CO2●− radical anion to the surface) in aqueous media. This same mechanism can be evoked to explain the formation of mainly formic acid on p-GaP, p-GaAs and p+/p-Si photocathode owing to no adsorption of singly reduced CO2●− radical anion to the surface. In case of p-InP and p-CdTe photocathode, partial adsorption of CO2●− radical anion leads to formation of both carbon monoxide and formic acid. Low catalytic current density for CO2 photoreduction and competitive hydrogen generation are two major drawbacks of this system.|$|E

It is difficult to design the AMC structure to operate at low (824 ~ 960 [*]MHz) and <b>high</b> <b>bands</b> (1710 ~ 2170 [*]MHz) simultaneously, because of the limited space available for the antenna.
