40|$|Abstract. Understanding and {{optimizing}} multithreaded execution is {{a significant}} challenge. Numerous research and industrial tools debug par-allel performance by combing through program source or thread traces for pathologies including communication overheads, data dependencies, and load imbalances. This work takes a new approach: it ignores any underlying pathologies, and focuses instead on pinpointing the exact lo-cations in source code that consume the largest share of execution. Our new metric, ParaShares, scores and ranks all basic blocks in a program based on their share of parallel execution. For the eight benchmarks ex-amined in this paper, ParaShare rankings point to <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> important <b>blocks</b> per application. The paper demonstrates two uses of this infor-mation, exploring how the important blocks vary across thread counts and input sizes, and making modest source code changes (fewer than 10 lines of code) that result in 14 - 92 % savings in parallel program runtime. ...|$|R

40|$|Polling I/O {{mechanisms}} on the Unix platform such as select() and poll() cause high processing overhead {{when they}} are used in a heavily-loaded network server with many concurrent open sockets. Large waste of processing power incurs not only service degradation but also various troubles such as high electronic power consumption and worsened MTBF of server hosts. It is thus a serious is-sue especially in large-scale service providers such as an Internet data center (iDC) where {{a great number of}} heavily-loaded network servers are operated. As a solution of this problem, we propose a technique of fine-grained control on the invocation intervals of the polling I/O function. The uniqueness of this study is the utilization of POSIX real-time scheduling to enable the fine-grained execution con-trol. Although earlier solutions such as an explicit event delivery mechanism also addressed the problem, they re-quire major modification in the OS kernel and transition from the traditional polling I/O model to the new explicit event-notification model. On the other hand, our technique can be implemented with low cost because it <b>just</b> inserts <b>a</b> <b>few</b> small <b>blocks</b> of codes into the server program and does not require any modification in the OS kernel. key words: polling I/O, POSIX real-time scheduling, inter-val control, processor utilization, network programming...|$|R

40|$|Many viruses have a {{symmetrical}} structure made from basic building blocks, and biologists {{have struggled to}} {{explain some of the}} more detailed shapes. Now, mathematicians are using complex theories of symmetry to reveal these viral structures, ultimately leading to new treatments for diseases. Viruses are responsible for a variety of illnesses, ranging from the common cold to more serious conditions such as AIDS and some types of cancer, but their methods of infection are always similar. Once a virus has entered a host’s body, it hijacks the replicating mechanisms within the host’s cells and starts pumping out copies of itself. Viruses can only do this by concealing their genomic material within a protein shell, or capsid, which allows them to slip inside the host’s body like a Trojan horse. These capsid shells often have complex {{symmetrical structure}}s, so mathematicians are investigating their shapes in the hope of discovering new treatments for viral infections. A virus is essentially <b>just</b> <b>a</b> short string of DNA (or RNA, a related molecule) wrapped inside a capsid shell, and longer strings of genomic material require a larger shell to hold them. This creates a problem because the genomic material must describe the entire virus, including the capsid, and a larger shell in turn requires a longer string of DNA or RNA. Francis Crick and James Watson, the biologists who also discovered the structure of DNA, suggested in 1956 that symmetrical capsids provide a solution as they can be constructed from <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> basic building <b>blocks.</b> This means the genomic material of a symmetrical virus can be much smaller, because it simply needs to describe small sections of the capsid and instructions for repeating them in a symmetrical pattern. It was later found that many viruses use icosahedral symmetry to compact their genome, as their capsids resemble a shape made from 20 triangular faces called an icosahedron. It can be rotated in 60 different ways and still appear to be the same – in other words, it has 60 axes of symmetry. “Modelling the structure of viruses could have enormous ramifications for drug design and the development of new treatments. ” Although this model works well for small viruses with 60 proteins, it cannot explain the structures of larger capsids, suggesting there is a more intricate pattern at work...|$|R
