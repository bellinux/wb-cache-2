5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with the stage {{and that the only}} play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Frusciante married Nicole Turley, drummer {{and lead}} vocalist of the {{experimental}} band Swahili Blonde. On May 8, 2015 {{it was announced that}} Turley had filed for divorce. On October 3, 2015, Turley announced that she was seeking $75,000 a month as part of their divorce settlement. According to court documents, Turley, who was already being paid $20,000 a month, needs a higher payment to maintain her quality of living. She claims her finances are down to only $30,000. Turley said that Frusciante was worth $14 million and she was entitled to more money saying that together the couple employed a team of personal assistants, and owned three homes and a private music studio. A week later Frusciante responded to Turley's demands saying that he refuses to pay her any more money and that she is also seeking $2,600 a month for gifts and expenses for her adult brother. He also said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> footing the bill for her musical career saying “I don’t know if you can call her recording efforts a hobby or a past-time … but it seems improper to characterize Nicole as a professional musician.” On October 19, 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Turley saying Frusciante had to pay his former wife $53,000 a month. Frusciante was also forced to pay $71,000 for Turley's legal expenses.|$|E

25|$|The Red Sox {{tied the}} game {{at four in the}} top of the seventh inning.

The bullpen held the Yankees scoreless but the offense couldn't score either. In game two, Boston came into the ninth with a 3–0 lead, but Craig Kimbrel could not record an out. He walked three and gave up a hit. Joe Kelly recorded two outs, before he gave up the game winning grand slam. Despite the loss, the Red Sox clinched the division with the help of the orioles, who beat the Blue Jays. Xander Bogaerts went deep to score the only run in the 1–5 loss. In his final series in the Bronx, David Ortiz went 0–10.|$|E

The show aired live from 8:30a.m. to 10:30a.m. and was then replayed from 10:30a.m. to 12:30p.m. XM Radio carried his show on a thirty-minute delay, from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., beginning March 5, 2007, on XM Sports Nation, Channel 144. Kornheiser went on hiatus from the show following the June 28, 2007, broadcast because of his Monday Night Football duties. The show was hosted by David Burd and included the same supporting cast. The show was called The Tony Kornheiser Show Starring David Burd during the hiatus. Kornheiser returned to the show as the full-time host from January 21, 2008, to June 27, 2008. The show aired live from 8:00a.m. to 10:00a.m. and was replayed from 2:00p.m. to 4:00 p.m on WWWT, and on XM Sports Nation, XM channel 144 from 8:15a.m. to 10:00a.m. He announced during this period in 2008 {{that he would not}} be back on the radio until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with Monday Night Football.|$|E
25|$|Morley {{made his}} debut for TNA on the January 4, 2010 episode of Impact! in a {{backstage}} segment with the Beautiful People. On the January 14 episode of Impact! Morley had another segment, complete with revamped theme music, where {{he explained that}} he was no longer an adult film star, but rather an adult film producer. This led to Daniels coming to the ring and attacking him, setting up a match at the Genesis pay-per-view. At the pay-per-view Morley defeated Daniels in his first match for the company with his patented Money Shot. On the January 28 episode of Impact! Morley suffered his first loss in TNA, losing to Desmond Wolfe in an 8 Card Stud Tournament qualifying match. On the March 4, 2010 episode of Impact!, Morley pinned Jeff Jarrett in an impromptu Falls Count Anywhere match by order of Eric Bischoff, turning heel {{for the first time in}} TNA. However, the next day Morley announced on his Facebook page that largely due to the move of Impact! to Monday nights, his original plan to wrestle for both TNA and CMLL had to change and therefore <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> with TNA.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from Conan O'Brien, who thought of Marge getting {{a job at the}} power plant and that Mr. Burns has a crush on her. The animators had trouble animating Marge with the suit and lipstick. Director Jeff Lynch said there were a few scenes where Marge [...] "looks like a monster". All the jargon used by Troy McClure was {{accurately}} taken from a Time–Life foundation repair book. The original subplot for the episode was Mr. Burns telling Homer to dress up as Mister Atom and have him go to schools to talk to the children. The cast really liked Tom Jones as a guest star.

The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats.
