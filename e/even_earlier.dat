5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{a genetically}} clearly {{differentiated}} {{representative of the}} genus Boletopsis, which according to the investigations of Cooper and Leonard separated relatively early from the precursor of most other known species. Only a North American species, B.leucomelaena, branches off from their phylogenetic tree <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> However, the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study, so in the future, new species may be described.|$|E

5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Mahabalipuram was {{constructed}} by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, {{there is evidence that}} a small port might have functioned at the site <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Sadras near Mahabalipuram has been identified as the site of the port of Sopatma mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E
5|$|As further proof, Anne Wales Abbot {{was busy}} {{designing}} The Game Of Racers for Crosby and Nichols of Boston, an Ives's competitor. According to The Salem Observer, The Game Of Racers {{went on sale}} in Salem, Massachusetts through J. P. Jewett on January 13, 1844. It went on sale in Boston <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> Abbot would {{have been working with}} Crosby and Nichols in Boston while the Ives firm published The Mansion Of Happiness.|$|E

5|$|Hunslet Grange Flats (more {{commonly}} known as the Leek Street Flats) displayed brutalism. They replaced run down back to back houses. It is unusual that Leek Street was chosen as their informal name as they replaced many other streets, including longer streets such as Alton Street. The flats were popular at first; however, they were so poorly designed and constructed that in 1983 they were demolished only thirteen years after being constructed. Smaller shops on the site had been demolished <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{intended}} by its creator Ian Fleming {{to become a}} film even before he completed the novel in 1954, since he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had written <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> The film's producers had originally intended to film For Your Eyes Only, but instead chose this title due {{to the rise of}} the science fiction genre {{in the wake of the}} Star Wars phenomenon. Budgetary issues caused the film to be primarily shot in France, with locations also in Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States. The soundstages of Pinewood Studios in England, traditionally used for the series, were only used by the special effects team.|$|E
5000|$|Unstructured betting, {{usually called}} no limit. While blinds, antes, or bring-ins are fixed, players {{are free to}} bet {{as much as they}} wish, <b>even</b> <b>early</b> in a round of betting. To bet all of one's chips (risking one's tournament life, in the event of losing the hand) is to go all-in. In no-limit tournaments, players will {{sometimes}} take this risk <b>even</b> <b>early</b> in the betting; for example, in some no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournaments, {{it is not uncommon for}} players to bet [...] "all-in" [...] before the flop.|$|R
50|$|Surrealists also {{included}} artists like Max Ernst, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí, and Francis Picabia, sculptors like Jean Arp, Germaine Richier and <b>even</b> <b>early</b> film-makers, like Luis Buñuel and René Clair.|$|R

5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was {{probably}} a fairly small site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Other fossils {{attest to}} the <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> {{presence}} of H. erectus in Java. Sangiran 2 (named after its discovery site) may be as old as 1.66 Ma (million years). The controversial Mojokerto child, which Carl C. Swisher and Garniss Curtis once dated to 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 ± 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with {{a margin of error}} of plus or minus 130,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene parrot {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to Europe, {{where they lived}} in captivity. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in Paris and Vienna. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so {{it is probable that}} the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become extinct in the wild <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Even</b> <b>early</b> on, Steinbrenner was meddlesome and irrepressible. Basketball lore {{indicates}} that at halftime of the November 22, 1961 {{game against the}} Hawaii Chiefs, he sold player Grady McCollum to the Chiefs at halftime.|$|R

5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water levels may have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest {{that it was in}} daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190Mya. Interestingly, it possessed {{features}} of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an <b>even</b> <b>earlier</b> arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1880s and <b>even</b> <b>early</b> 1900s, Trenton prospered {{because it was}} roughly a day's journey between Detroit and Monroe, Michigan, which meant people {{traveling}} between the two cities would have to stop overnight in Trenton.|$|R
50|$|The {{peculiarities of}} this episode were already being {{discussed}} in Antiquity. <b>Even</b> <b>early</b> commentators were {{shocked by the}} storyline {{and its implications for}} the morality of the gods. An expression of this moral criticism is found in Plato's Republic.|$|R
25|$|In biology {{organs are}} defined as {{confined}} functional units within an organism.

5|$|The {{genocide}} in Lithuania {{is seen by}} some historians {{as one of the}} earliest large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an opinion that the Holocaust began in Lithuania in the summer of 1941. Other scholars say the Holocaust started in September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War, or <b>even</b> <b>earlier,</b> on Kristallnacht in 1938, or, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E
5|$|The texts for {{the early}} cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical {{passages}} and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or <b>even</b> <b>earlier.</b> Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when {{he moved on to}} the Weimar court.|$|E
50|$|The {{advent of}} {{firearms}} eventually rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery, almost every culture that {{gained access to}} <b>even</b> <b>early</b> firearms used them widely, to the relative neglect of archery.|$|R
