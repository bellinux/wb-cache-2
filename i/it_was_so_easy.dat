5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as they thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy.</b> It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as {{by the time the}} bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain permission and the profits could be huge {{compared to the}} low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made harder to get a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E
500|$|As {{inspiration}} for the album, Duff cited indie rock band The Faint and pop singers such as Gwen Stefani and Beyoncé, while critics compared her musical style with Stefani, Janet Jackson, Depeche Mode, Madonna and Justin Timberlake. Duff felt that the album's dance-pop themes were a deviation from the pop rock of her previous albums. [...] "I didn't necessarily plan the album to sound like this, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to write to," [...] she said. Critics have noted that Dignitys musical style is dance-pop and electropop, with influences of hip hop, rock and roll and Middle Eastern music. According to Duff, the album {{is a combination of}} dance, electro and rock music.|$|E

500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very hard. I salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E
500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keaton {{met with}} more {{success in the}} medium of still photography. Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone {{had asked me to}} take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." [...] Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} likely developed {{because in}} addition to not having the physique commonly associated with power hitters, Ott used an unusual batting technique. The [...] outfielder preceded his swings by dropping his hands, lifting his front leg and stepping forward on it as the pitch came. Since that defied accepted baseball wisdom about how to hit the long ball, {{it was assumed that}} Ott was focusing on the short right field fence, and sportswriters often kidded him about this. Ott, who worked on his technique extensively, would usually respond by pointing out that if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy,</b> other batters in the league {{should have been able to}} hit even more of those home runs when visiting the Giants. It has also been pointed out that Ott's best-known home run, which won his team the 1933 World Series from the Washington Senators, was hit in Griffith Stadium, not the Polo Grounds, and over a longer fence.|$|E

2500|$|Protection {{papers were}} used by American sailors to prevent {{themselves}} from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>easy</b> to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy {{paid no attention to}} them. [...] "In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'" [...] One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. [...] "Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos." ...|$|E
