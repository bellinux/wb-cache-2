5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and dreams, {{for a more}} linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> come together {{on the outskirts of}} an unnamed city {{at the end of an}} unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E

5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of the human species. According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, ending with a cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E
5|$|The Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules {{made under}} the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act require a permit for any public {{assembly}} or procession {{of five or}} more persons in any public place. The rationale given for this law is that a large <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent. In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore, the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed. Although there have only been a few minor protests since then, the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests. On 31 December 2000, 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly.|$|E
