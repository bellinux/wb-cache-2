In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the <b>fermenter,</b> where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
25|$|In beer brewing some {{styles of}} beer (sour beer) {{purposely}} contain lactic acid. Most commonly this is produced naturally by various strains of bacteria. These bacteria ferment sugars into acids, unlike yeast, who ferment sugar into ethanol. One such style are Belgian Lambics. After cooling the wort, yeast and bacteria {{are allowed to}} “fall” into the open fermenters. Most brewers of more common beer styles would ensure no such bacteria are allowed to enter the <b>fermenter.</b> Other sour styles of beer include Berliner weisse, Flanders red and American wild ale.|$|E

The {{effect of}} the feed-to-buffer ratio on {{bacterial}} diversity and ruminal fermentation in single-flow continuous-culture <b>fermenters.</b> Journal of Dairy Science, 94, (3), 1374 - 1384. Eight single-flow continuous-culture <b>fermenters</b> were used in a completely randomized block design with a 2 ? 4 factorial arrangement of treatments to investigate {{the effects of the}} feed-to-buffer ratio (F/B) on ruminal fermentation, the diversity and community structure of bacteria, nutrient digestibility, and N metabolism. Four diets with forage-to-concentrate ratios of 70 : 30 or 30 : 70 with alfalfa or grass hay as forage were supplied to <b>fermenters</b> twice per day at 2 different F/B (23. 5 and 35 g of DM/L). The dilution rate was kept constant (5. 3 %) among all <b>fermenters</b> by infusing the same volume of buffer. An increase in the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and a decrease in the average pH were observed with an increased F/B. In addition, the molar proportions of all individual VFA found in <b>fermenters</b> differed, depending on the F/B. A terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that the community structure and diversity of bacteria were highly influenced by the F/B. Both diversity and the number of peaks in the electropherograms were lower in most <b>fermenters</b> receiving diets at a high F/B, whereas the similarity percentage of the bacterial communities across diets was higher as the F/B increased. Moreover, the high reduction of neutral detergent fiber digestibility (15. 3 % ? 3. 65) in <b>fermenters</b> with high F/B suggested a pH-related decrease in the cellulolytic bacterial community as the F/B increased. The crude protein degradation found in <b>fermenters</b> receiving diets with a high F/B was lower compared with that from <b>fermenters</b> with a low F/B. The VFA concentration and purine bases flow response patterns to diets were similar to in vivo conditions only in the case of <b>fermenters</b> with a low F/B. The results suggested that the community structure and diversity of bacteria, as well as the in vitro fermentation parameters, may be affected by the F/B that is used, most likely through a pH effect. In addition, several fermentation parameters showed different response patterns to diets according to the F/B used. Therefore, the amount of feed supplied to single-flow continuous-culture <b>fermenters</b> in which pH is not under control should be carefully chosen according to the volume of buffer infused for the purpose of simulating ruminal fermentation.

Differences between ruminant foregut <b>fermenters</b> and hindgut <b>fermenters</b> were remarkable for example in the way they ingest and digest high fibre diets. Digestion trials based on total collections are difficult to conduct or are sometimes even not possible for wild animals in the field or in zoos. To gain information on the fibre digestion achieved by these animals and the influence of body mass (BM) thereon, a method using spot sampling is desirable. In this study, in vitro fermentation of faecal neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was used as a measure of fibre digestion in large ungulates. Food and faecal samples of 10 ruminant foregut fermenting and 7 hindgut fermenting species/breeds were collected. All animals received 100 % grass hay with ad libitum access.
