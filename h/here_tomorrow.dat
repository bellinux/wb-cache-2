500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{was written}} by current showrunner Al Jean and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April11,1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish I was back at The Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E

[...] The system was obtained {{and set up}} at the Lincoln Memorial, but was sabotaged {{on the day before}} the March. Its operators were unable to repair it.

2500|$|Bierce {{is known}} to have {{accompanied}} Villa's army as far as the city of Chihuahua. His last known communication with the world was a letter he wrote there to Blanche Partington, a close friend, dated December 26, 1913. After closing this letter by saying, [...] "As to me, I leave <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow</b> for an unknown destination," [...] he vanished without a trace, his disappearance becoming {{one of the most famous}} in American literary history. Skeptic Joe Nickell argued that no letter had ever been found; all that existed was a notebook belonging to his secretary and companion, Carrie Christiansen, containing a rough summary of a purported letter and her statement that the originals had been destroyed.|$|E
2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right."

[...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you come in <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> and anything you do with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E

[...] Lacking a Navy or Marine training program on its campus, Wisconsin had lost most of its best football players after the 1942 season, with the majority being transferred to Michigan. [...] On the day before the game, Detroit sports writer Watson Spoelstra joked, [...] "Shed a tear, friend, for [...] Harry Stuhldreher who, in effect, will field two football teams <b>here</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> one for Wisconsin and one for Michigan."
