50|$|A contest {{has begun}} with big prizes {{for the first}} person who discovers the Lost World. Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have already taken off to find it, leaving a disgruntled Dixie Kong behind. Deciding to prove herself <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> of capable <b>as</b> them, Dixie {{partners}} up with her little cousin Kiddy Kong. Unfortunately, Baron K. Roolenstein and the Kremling Krew are also searching high and low for the fabled land. While never stated outright in the game, it's believed that the setting is the Northern Kremisphere, as the level archetypes are the same as in Donkey Kong Country 3 which took place in the Northern Kremisphere. While the levels have the same environments and the Donkey Kong Country 3 bosses return, the worlds and stage layout are all unique.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{orthogonal}} coding can be used to approach the Shannon capacity of the power-constrained AWGN channel without a bandwidth constraint. In this paper, I show {{that it is possible to}} do this using a semi-orthogonal variation of pulse position modulation that is sequential in nature [...] - bits can be "streamed out" without having to bu#er up blocks of bits at the transmitter. ML decoding of the code results in an exponentially small probability of error as a function of tolerated receiver delay and thus eventually a zero probability of error on <b>every</b> transmitted <b>bit.</b> Just <b>as</b> orthogonal coding is related to the idea of capacity per unit cost, this code suggests an interesting sequential version of that problem...|$|R
25|$|With the ministerial scandals neutralised and the State Plan launched, one of Labor's few {{remaining}} worries {{for the election}} was {{the completion of the}} new Lane Cove Tunnel. Labor feared that the tunnel could prove <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> problematic as the controversial Cross City Tunnel. At issue in both projects were changes to existing surface roads designed to funnel traffic into the new motorways.|$|E
25|$|The pavilions were <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> {{magnificent}} as the bridge. They {{were covered}} with sandstone from Saxony, and the sculptor Johan Christof Petzoldt richly decorated the concave roofs with the royal couple's back-to-back monograms and four figures on each roof symbolising the royal couple's positive traits. The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason Jacob Fortling. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} BMX sanctioning body was the National Bicycle Association (NBA) started by Ernie Alexander in 1972. Like Scot Breithaupt, he had motorcycle motocross in his background, and like Scot {{he was a}} promoter but a professional one with his American Cycle Enterprises (ACE). He was also a former Hollywood stunt man who promoted races at the famous Indian Dunes, built and managed by Walt James, where many movies and TV shows were filmed. In 1970 he noticed {{a group of kids}} trying to organize a bicycle race with their Schwinn Sting-Rays. Being familiar with motorcycle racing, he lent the kids a hand. He later opened the Yarnell track, a steep downhill course <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> treacherous by today's standards as Scot Breithaupt's BUMS track—if not more so. In 1972 he created the National Bicycle Association, modeled on the existing American Motorcycle Association (AMA). It was Mr. Alexander who built a truly nation-spanning professional sanctioning body for BMX.|$|E

This {{was followed by a}} series of concerts, including at the IndigO2 in London, and a performance in Anchorage, Alaska. Reviews of B-Sides and Rarities were generally good; Devin Grant of The Post and Courier wrote that [...] "For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release is <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> good, and <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> fun, as the band's previous studio releases", while Catherine P.

GameSpot's Mc Shea noted the city's neighborhoods were varied and felt alive, and found the visuals [...] "great-looking".

The historian Ronald Hutton noted that in her political and social views, Fortune was likely a High Tory, with Richardson noting that politically, she was [...] "somewhat aligned" [...] to {{the ideas of the}} Conservative politician Winston Churchill. Graf noted that although Fortune was not involved in the feminist movement and did not associate with feminists, she [...] "thought herself <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> powerful, capable, independent, and discerning as any man, and she worked to spiritually empower women." [...] When staying at Queensborough, Fortune kept a vegetarian diet.|$|E
500|$|Issue #3 {{received}} an average score of 6.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Schedeen {{gave it a}} 5.1 saying, [...] "Civil War II looks <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> good as you'd expect from Marvel's flagship event comic. Unfortunately, this series doesn't have nearly enough to offer beneath that gorgeous exterior. There's too much dialogue and exposition and not enough progress or dramatic weight to the story." [...] Pepose gave it a 6 [...] and said, [...] "Civil War II #3 is a decent chapter of an event story that feels like plenty of other event stories. But as far as memorials go, it's unfortunately pretty forgettable fare." ...|$|E

500|$|Hendrix was {{inspired}} musically by American {{rock and roll}} and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize {{the use of a}} wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: [...] "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source.

[...] According to Sara Smith of The Kansas City Star, [...] "The shock and delight of the showy storytelling ... has faded a bit". Smith says that Barnes, Skorsky, and Goodwin's [...] "investigation sucks them down a rabbit hole into a surreal underworld no sane reporter would explore".

Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. Whether you have read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E
