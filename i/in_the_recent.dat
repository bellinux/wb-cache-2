5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|In May 1648, a Royalist {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey - a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire - {{was put in charge}} of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries about the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster at some point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that {{the density of the}} core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Norman's {{position}} as the Goblin King was quickly usurped by the Goblin Knight (Phil Urich). However, a mysterious man with a bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries. This man reveals himself to be Norman Osborn, alive again post-Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider-Man. He is revealed to have played a part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> coup of Symkaria. He restores a semblance of his original features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but also resembles the Green Goblin's facets, and intends to release {{a modified version of}} the Goblin formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him.|$|E

5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, {{are very close to}} each other, and have differentiated only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|Since Norfolk {{contains}} the {{central business district}} of Hampton Roads, {{most of the major}} spectator sports are located there. While the Hampton Roads area has been recently considered as a viable prospect for major-league professional sports, and regional leaders have attempted to obtain Major League Baseball, NBA and NHL franchises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past, no team has yet relocated to the area. Hampton Roads is the second largest metropolitan area in the United States without a club in a major professional sports league, after the Austin metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> past. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E
