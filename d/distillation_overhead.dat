40|$|We {{propose a}} family of error-detecting {{stabilizer}} codes with an encoding rate of 1 / 3 that permit a transversal implementation of the gate T=exp(−iπZ/ 8) on all logical qubits. These codes are used to construct protocols for distilling high-quality “magic” states T|+〉 by Clifford group gates and Pauli measurements. The <b>distillation</b> <b>overhead</b> scales as O(logγ(1 /ε)), where ε is the output accuracy and γ=log_ 2 (3) ≈ 1. 6. To construct the desired family of codes, we introduce {{the notion of a}} triorthogonal matrix, a binary matrix in which any pair and any triple of rows have even overlap. Any triorthogonal matrix gives rise to a stabilizer code with a transversal T gate on all logical qubits, possibly augmented by Clifford gates. A powerful numerical method for generating triorthogonal matrices is proposed. Our techniques lead to a twofold overhead reduction for distilling magic states with accuracy ε∼ 10 ^(− 12) compared with previously known protocols...|$|E

50|$|The cooling and {{condensing}} of the <b>distillation</b> tower <b>overhead</b> {{is provided}} partially by exchanging heat with the incoming crude oil and partially by either an air-cooled or water-cooled condenser. Additional heat {{is removed from}} the distillation column by a pumparound system as shown in the diagram below.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the differing}} vapour {{pressures}} of the distillate, {{there will be a}} change in the <b>overhead</b> <b>distillation</b> with time, as early on in the batch distillation, the distillate will contain a high concentration of the component with the higher relative volatility. As the supply of the material is limited and lighter components are removed, the relative fraction of heavier components will increase as the distillation progresses.|$|R
40|$|Vapor {{recompression}} of <b>distillation</b> columns <b>overheads,</b> {{followed by}} subsequent condensation in the reboiler results in substantial operating cost savings compared to conventional steam driv;n reboiler systems. The use of high performance heat exchangers and distillation trays permits additional energy savings by lower reboiler temperature dif ferences, and reduced reflux requirements for a fixed column height, due to closer tray spacings. This paper surveys the heat pump systems cur rently in operation using high performance UCC MD trays and High Flux tubing. Design considerations for {{high or low}} pressure level towers, with single or dual stage compression equipment are discussed, along with the various control methods. Factors affecting startup, part load, and off design operation of the equipment are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|The Honeywell {{chemical}} plant located in Hopewell, Virginia includes processing units that purify raw phenol, react the phenol with hydrogen to form crude cyclohexanone, and purify the crude cyclohexanone. In {{order to reduce}} energy usage, two opportunities for heat recovery and heat integration were identified. A feasibility study and economic analysis were performed on the two opportunities, and both projects were implemented. The first project utilized the heat contained in a <b>distillation</b> process <b>overheads</b> stream to preheat the raw material entering the distillation process. This was accomplished via a heat exchanger, and reduced the utility steam requirement by 10, 000 pph. The second project utilized the heat generated by the hydrogenation reaction (in the form of waste heat steam) to preheat the feed material in an adjacent process. This was accomplished via a heat exchanger, and reduced the utility steam requirement by 8, 000 pph. These two energy projects required $ 1. 1 million of capital and saved $ 1. 0 million in utility steam annually...|$|R
50|$|The first {{unit process}} in a {{petroleum}} refinery is the crude oil <b>distillation</b> unit. The <b>overhead</b> liquid distillate from that unit is called virgin or straight-run naphtha and that distillate is the largest source of naphtha in most petroleum refineries. The naphtha {{is a mixture of}} many different hydrocarbon compounds. It has an initial boiling point (IBP) of about 35 °C and a final boiling point (FBP) of about 200 °C, and it contains paraffins, naphthenes (cyclic paraffins) and aromatic hydrocarbons ranging from those containing 4 carbon atoms to those containing about 10 or 11 carbon atoms.|$|R
