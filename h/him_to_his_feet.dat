2500|$|As the Prince {{receives}} the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, {{he considers the}} joys (sensual, spiritual, political and animal - in particular, the loving and playful Bendicò) and the sorrows (political, sexual, and familial) he's experienced, concluding {{that out of the}} seventy-three years he's been alive, he has only fully lived three of them. In his last moments, as his family gathered round, he sees a young woman appear - beautiful, exquisitely dressed, sensitive, and smiling lovingly. Narration describes her in terms identical to those in which it describes a beautiful woman glimpsed at the train station {{on the way back to}} Palermo—in other words, death was present in his life even then. As the woman helps <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> he sees her face, and to him she appears [...] "lovelier than she ever had when glimpsed in stellar space." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white and his face was deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E
2500|$|Cook's {{men and the}} British Marines {{were confronted}} on the beach by an elderly kahuna who {{approached}} them holding a coconut and chanting. They yelled at the priest to go away but he kept approaching them while singing the mele. When Cook and his men looked away from the old kahuna, they saw that the beach was now filled with thousands of Native Hawaiians. Cook yelled at Kalaniʻōpuʻu to get up but the ruler refused. As the townspeople began to gather around them, Cook and his men began {{to back away from}} the crowd and raise their guns. The two chiefs and Kānekapōlei shielded the aliʻi nui as Cook tried to force <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> Kanaʻina approached Cook, who reacted by striking the chief with the broad side of his sword. Kanaʻina instantly grabbed Cook and lifted the man. Some accounts state that Kanaʻina did not intend to hit Cook while other descriptions say the chief struck the navigator across the head with his leiomano. Either way, Kanaʻina released Cook, who fell to the sand. As Cook tried to get up, the attendant, Nuaa fatally stabbed him with a metal dagger, ironically traded from Cook's ship during the same visit. According to John Ledyard, Cook fired the first shot in the skirmish and therefore was responsible for the circumstances that led to his death. [...] Ledyard describes the escalation in his journal: [...] "Cook attended to what this man said, and desired him to show him the Indian that had dared to attempt combat with him, {{and as soon as he}} was pointed out, Cook fired at him with a blank. The indian perceiving he received no damage from the fire rushed from without the crowd a second time, and threatened anyone who should oppose him. Cook perceiving this fired a ball, which entering the Indian's groin he fell and was drawn off by the rest. Cook perceiving the people determined to oppose his designs, and that he should not succeed without further bloodshed ordered the lieutenant of marines (Mr. Phillips) to withdraw his men and get them into the boats.....the instant they began to retreat, Cook was hit with a stone and perceiving the man who hove, shot him dead: the officers in the boats perceiving the guard retreating and hearing this third discharge ordered [...] the boats to fire.....Cook having at length reached the margin of the water between the fire of the boats waved with his hat to cease firing and come in, and while he was doing this a chief from behind stabbed him with one of our iron daggers just under the shoulder blade, and passed quite through the body. Cook fell with his face in the water and immediately expired." [...] This caused a close quarters melee between the townspeople and Cook's companions. Four of the Royal Marines (Corporal James Thomas and Privates Theophilus Hinks, Thomas Fachett, and John Allen) were killed, and two were wounded. The remaining sailors and marines fired as they fled to their small boat and rowed back to their ship, injuring and killing dozens of Native Hawaiians on the beach, including possibly High Chief Kanaʻina. Cook's ships did not leave Kealakekua bay until February 22nd. They remained for another week to continue repair of the mast and collect better quality drinking water. [...] According to John Ledyard's journal's hundreds of natives were shot in a series of ongoing skirmishes. The ships cannon was used on several occasions among the natives and a large portion of Kireekakooa, the southern town in the bay, was burned.|$|E
