[...] He continued, [...] "This week, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bit of a loss, because despite a return to an older, more successful formula, with a clearly plotted path, Family Guy didn't muster up enough material to fill out the A-plot of a half hour." [...] McFarland also stated that the episode did not live up to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, that the title of the episode was named after. He concluded his review of the episode by giving the episode a grade of C. Terren R. Moore of Ology also found the episode to be unimpressive, noting, [...] "It's good fun while it's on, but nothing here really sticks or adds to anything new to love about Family Guy." [...] Moore also commented, [...] "it's a pretty weak episode of Family Guy, where the most memorable joke of the night involves a thought bubble where Quagmire pulls a string of beads out of a woman's vagina." [...] In the conclusion of the review, Moore gave the episode a 6/10 score.|$|E

[...] His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as [...] "a big break. One day, I was at RADA doing a movement class, the next <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour." [...] Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an [...] "excellent" [...] performance while The Observer wrote of [...] "a notable West End debut". In 1992, Sheen's performance in Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him [...] "the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer". His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. and was described by The Independent as [...] "quite thrilling". Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in {{the world premiere of}} Harold Pinter's Moonlight at the Almeida Theatre and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series Gallowglass.|$|E
