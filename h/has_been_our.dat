A draw against Sunderland, having been 2–0 up at half time meant Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, eight points behind Manchester United.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} {{influenced}} by music Goddard and Taylor listened to during their childhood and adolescence, such as Prince's Sign o' the Times and The Beatles' White Album. Taylor explained why Hot Chip's albums [...] "go from one mood to another so readily", by saying [...] "Eclectic music <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>our</b> first musical background" [...] and that he and Goddard had different musical interests when they were younger. Made in the Dark {{is influenced by}} contemporary artists such as Black Dice and Will Oldham. Taylor appreciated Oldham for his minimalism of [...] "just acoustic guitar and harmonium and voice for the whole record" [...] and wanted Hot Chip to emulate him.|$|E
500|$|As Europe moved towards war in {{the late}} 1930s, Davies opposed the {{appeasement}} policies of the Chamberlain government. He doubted {{the will of the}} British ruling classes to wage a determined war against fascism, and called for a workers' [...] "Popular Front" [...] of resistance to the dictators. After the outbreak of war in September 1939 Davies demanded from the British government [...] "a more specific and detailed statement" [...] of war aims, to allay [...] "suspicions... as to the real and possibly as yet unstated war aims of this country and of France". He criticised Labour's decision in May 1940 to join Churchill's wartime coalition government, and thereafter opposed many of the coalition's domestic policies, such as indiscriminate internment of aliens, restrictions on industrial action, and the suppression of the communist newspaper the Daily Worker. The bitterness of Davies's personal attack on Herbert Morrison, the Home Secretary who had authorised the paper's closure, shocked even the British Communist Party's general secretary, Harry Pollitt, who cautioned Davies that [...] "personal abuse <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>our</b> stock-in-trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere".|$|E
500|$|Planning, Gad Yaakobi {{said that}} the debate had [...] "already caused {{considerable}} damage to Israel", and Former Foreign Minister Abba Eban stated that the [...] "free exercise of conscience and dissent in a democratic society" [...] was at stake. The center also received support in the U.S., as former President Gerald Ford spoke for the center, as well the United Jewish Council of Utah, who wrote a letter stating that [...] "For over one hundred years, the Jewish and LDS communities have coexisted in the Salt Lake Valley {{in a spirit of}} true friendship and harmony. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>our</b> experience that when the leaders of the LDS Church make a commitment of policy, it is a commitment which can be relied upon. The stated commitment of Brigham Young University not to violate the laws of the state of Israel, or its own commitment regarding proselytizing in the state of Israel through the Jerusalem-based Brigham Young facility, is a commitment which we sincerely believe will be honored." [...] The U.S. government also became an intermediary for BYU as 154 members of Congress issued a letter to the Knesset in support of the BYU Jerusalem Center. In 1986, the Knesset approved the completion of the center.|$|E

500|$|Overall {{the quality}} was low, but {{according}} to sf historian Brian Stableford, [...] "sf writers given carte blanche to write pure fantasy for [...] did often produce readable fiction with a distinctive whimsical and ironic flavour". Critic John Clute's assessment {{was that it was}} inconsistent, [...] "but there were some terrific tales in it. Not enough, but some." [...] Notable stories from the post-war era include Theodore Sturgeon's [...] "Largo" [...] and Raymond F. Jones' [...] "The Children's Room". The artwork was generally of higher quality than the stories; Ashley describes Fantastic Adventures as [...] "one of the best-illustrated magazines around". Regular artists included Virgil Finlay, Henry Sharp, Rod Ruth, and Malcolm Smith. In Palmer's words, [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>our</b> experience that covers sell magazinessimply because they attract attention." [...] For the first year the cover art, while dramatic, was more likely to show an action scene with a male hero than a damsel in distress, but in August 1940 H.W. McCauley's cover showed a glamorous woman in a sparkling dress. Similar covers followed with increasing frequency, with readers and editors giving the various heroines the name of [...] "MacGirl". Science fiction historian Paul Carter, commenting on the change from action scenes to alluring women on the covers, suggests that [...] "surely the war {{had something to do with}} this". Science fiction art often included spaceships as phallic symbols; author and critic Brian Aldiss remarked on a Fantastic Adventures cover, from March 1949, that included a submarine as a phallic symbol instead. Readers' letters often objected to the attractive women and the implied sexual content, but the stories themselves were quite tame.|$|E

2500|$|The {{highlight}} of his legal career was his successful argument of the 1906 civil rights case of Taylor v. Cohn. [...] The case involved Oliver Taylor, a black Pullman car porter, who {{was required to}} sit in the balcony at a Portland theater. [...] When informed that the theater prohibited the seating of blacks on the main floor, the plaintiff refused to exchange his tickets and sued the owner for $5000. [...] Stewart argued that protecting the rights of blacks against discrimination was accepted as a matter of public policy, despite Oregon's lack of a civil rights bill. [...] At the time, Oregon was more racially progressive than other western states, with state law not segregating schools, housing or public accommodations; though interracial marriage was prohibited. [...] The state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, sided with the theater owner's right to exclude any race from its premises; it editorialized that [...] "Colored people are wise to accept conditions that they cannot change or control, and go their way cheerfully", further asserting that [...] "it is a well known fact" [...] that whites objected to sitting next to blacks. [...] In his brief, Stewart argued that [...] "We have always regarded our rights in every respect to have been secure. [...] So well founded <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>our</b> belief until we regard that legislation, known as civil rights laws, which has been enacted in other states, to be unnecessary." [...] The trial court dismissed the case as groundless, but Stewart appealed. [...] The Oregon Supreme Court agreed with Stewart, and awarded Taylor a favorable judgment.|$|E
