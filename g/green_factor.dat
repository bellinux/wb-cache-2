Urban ecosystems contribute {{to the quality of}} life of urban dwellers and the cultural ecosystem services (CES) provided are the focus of the present thesis. The non-existence of a common framework for assessing CES and the insufficient attention towards CES is leading to the use of two recently developed tools within this thesis: the Blue <b>Green</b> <b>Factor,</b> developed by Oslo and Bærum municipality, and the Structural Diversity Tool, developed by Voigt et al. (2014). The aim of this thesis is to compare a park and a natural green space in Oslo using those tools and to assess the perceived values of the green spaces. Further the connection of those values, on the basis of the CES concept, to the blue green structures assessed, is discussed. The theoretical basis of the research relies on the concepts of cultural ecosystem services, the aesthetics of the pleasant and the experience of nature. Results show an immense difference of the blue <b>green</b> <b>factor</b> scores. The natural green space achieves a score that is five times higher than the score of the park. The structural diversity tool revealed similar result, the natural space scores however slightly higher. The observations and the interviews in the natural green space demonstrate that the green space is perceived as a restorative environment, but only during the day. The social environment in the evening was perceived as not pleasant and no activities were carried out at this time. The interviews demonstrated that accessibility, safety, tidiness and maintenance were of importance whilst deciding about a visit of the green space, nevertheless the aspects of compatibility, nature, the feeling of being away, extent of the space and the fascination elements were decisive for a visit. The observations within the park however revealed a picture of little use and no respondents were willing to participate in the interview study. The research identified five CES subservices in the natural green space: recreational services (stress relief), social interactions, educational services, the feeling of being away and aesthetical services. Some of these services can be connected to the provision of basic blue green settings, however abiotic side conditions have to be taken into consideration.

The collected data showed that EMCs were not correlated with storm factors whereas they showed significant differences according to the land use types. The calculated REMCs for BOD, COD, TSS, TN, and TP showed negative correlations with the GFs. However, even though the GFs of the agricultural area were concentrated in values of 80 like the green areas, the REMCs for TSS, TN, and TP were especially high. There were few differences in REMC runoff characteristics according to the GFs such as recreational facilities areas in suburbs and highways and trunk roads that connect to major roads between major cities. Except for those areas, the REMCs for BOD and COD were significantly related to the GFs. The REMCs for BOD and COD decreased when the rate of natural green area increased. On the other hand, some of the REMCs for TSS, TN, and TP were still high where the catchments encountered mixed land use patterns, especially public facility areas with bare ground and artificial grassland areas. The GF could therefore be used as a major planning indicator when establishing land use planning aimed at sustainable development with NPS management in urban areas if the weighted GF values will be improved...|$|E
40|$|What {{does it mean}} “green” {{architecture}}? Ecological? Sustainable? Devoid of CO 2 emission? Lots of trees? Integrated {{into the}} environment? Low energy impact? Probably green architecture means everything together, and…more. The green architecture is a new trend of architecture or, perhaps, {{a component of the}} Architecture itself in our time? A first consideration requires to consider how the building traditions of a people has certainly a wealth of features "green" even if they belong to the past and often forgotten. From the European building tradition derived typical solutions such as for residential applications common to different countries. The same use of light, and not just air, was considered one of the basic elements of a design that would maximize the contribution of natural resources, such as the air, the green, the sun. Designing and building green architecture is an important opportunity to upgrade the tradition and to rethink {{the quality of life in}} our homes and cities. For the actors in the current architectural landscape it is necessary to obtain, effectively, an integration between the “new” green criteria and the existing knowledge. While, in the past, we have talked about “integrated design”, today is affirmed a more scientific meaning of this integration, the concept of “holistic design”. One problem, whatever it is, must be faced and solved considering all aspects involved, in substance by all disciplines that help to define it. The Green Architecture is therefore able to offer a whole different contributions (economics, cultural technical, social,…) to the construction world, and in addition Green Architecture is emerging not only as a way to build, but also as a way of life. We believe that, beyond the current needs (and architectural trends), green (the <b>green</b> <b>factor)</b> should therefore return to be one of the factors always present in architecture design and construction. In other words, any project or architectural construction of high level will be, henceforth, designed in a holistic manner as green.

40|$|This study aims to {{demonstrate}} economic valuation of ecosystem services using available {{data in a}} pilot study area in Norway. Oslo Municipality was chosen because it provides a number of gra-dients, spatial scales and different levels of spatial resolution in which to discuss urban ecosystem services. The EU FP 7 research project OpenNESS and an ongoing collaboration with Oslo Mu-nicipality made it possible {{to demonstrate}} a number of value transfer methods. Value transfer is a rapid assessment approach that uses available studies transferred to a new context. The study outlines a framework for evaluating the information requirements of economic valuation of ecosystem services in different decision contexts. We use the framework to discuss information requirements of economic valuation to support different decision-contexts. Ecosystem services valuation and mapping unmotivated by specific decision context risks being both irrelevant and wasteful. In the present study we use value transfer methods for the general purpose of awareness-raising, which can be considered the least demanding in terms of requirements for accuracy and reliability. Valuation for awareness raising is illustrated with 6 different examples, four of which are economic valuation methods: Economic valuation examples: 1. Meta-analysis of willingness-to-pay for green spaces in the built zone 2. Hedonic pricing of green infrastructure in the built zone of Oslo 3. Time use value of Marka peri-urban forest outside the built zone of Oslo 4. Liability value of urban trees in the built zone Non-economic valuation examples: 5. Blue <b>green</b> <b>factor</b> scoring of property in the built zone of Oslo 6. Health impacts of green infrastructure in Oslo as a whole The two methods looking at recreation in green spaces (1) and the peri-urban forest (3) found annual values between one and several billion Norwegian kroner. The value of green spaces in property prices (2) and the liability value of city trees (4) revealed capital values in the range of tens of billions of Norwegian kroner. Despite uncertainty inherent in value transfers we feel confident that nature in Oslo has a total annual value of several billion kroner. This is conservative because we have used lower bound estimates. Furthermore, we know that our examples represent only a fraction of ecosystem ser-vices provided by green infrastructure, in our case mainly cultural ecosystem services. Regulating services remain largely unvalued in this study.

S-GVRP is based on the optimization of three problems of cost (PC), emission (PE), and satisfaction (PS), individually and simultaneously.

In addition to generating pareto front line between the objectives, measuring GLV and GR as green performance indicators is followed in S-GVRP. Indeed, it significantly helps decision-makers to select a solution that not only accounts for the economic orientation, but also considers customers’ satisfaction with regard to the environmentally friendly aspects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Supplier {{assessment}} is widely {{studied in the}} literature as {{it is an important}} means of managing supplier relationships. Based on literature results our paper examines the extension of the vendor evaluation methods with environmental, green issues. This generalization means an extension of the traditional criteria and weight system of the supplier evaluation methods. As green issues are getting recognition in purchasing and supply management, the literature is rapidly growing on how to develop green supplier evaluation systems. Studies focus on evaluation criteria and on evaluation methods. Since the 90 ’s the environmental criteria were widely investigated. Evaluation methodology also receives substantial attention in literature: several assessment methods were developed to incorporate green aspects in supplier management decisions. However it is still the weighted points method, which is mostly used by practitioners. In our paper the method of Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) is used to study the extension of traditional supplier selection methods with environmental factors. The selection of the weight system can control the result of the selection process. Our goal is to choose such weights which affect the results of the selection process. In this method we divide the criteria in two manners: the traditional and environmental (<b>green)</b> <b>factors.</b> Then with the help of DEA we are searching a weight system with which the environmental criteria can influence the decision with a representation of the <b>green</b> <b>factors.</b> In our study we look for a weight system to determine the environmental factors, as an important decision factors. To choose the mentioned weight system, we apply DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) with common weights analysis (CWA) method. In this case of DEA/CWA the common weights are calculated with a linear programming problem. The classical DEA requires to solve so many linear programming, as the number of the decision making units, but method DEA/CWA requires only one programming model.

Jan Skalík Abstract In the new {{millennium}} the Chamber of Deputies has been significantly less supportive towards environmental protection {{than it was in}} the 1990 s. It has been proved by the analysis of 156 votes concerning the environment in the period 1994 - 2010. Unequivocally, the strongest and the most influential factor in terms of the impact on the other characteristics and the environmental benefits is to which Parliamentary Club the deputy belongs. From the comparison of voting patterns of the Green Party (SZ) and Civic Democratic Party (ODS) it is possible to demonstrate why the environmental legislation is supported mostly by women and MPs from Moravian districts. Generally it could be said that growing political success in the parliamentary right-wing parties is linked to less favourable voting for the environment. However, among centrist and left wing parties this is different: proenvironmental voting is connected to success in the Chamber. MPs who vote pro- environmentally are often older and were elected to the Chamber earlier.

Although previous {{studies have shown that}} these factors influence the value of a property, the applicability of the findings from such studieswith regard to property valuation practice is still limited. This is due to lack of awareness on the effects of green aspects particularly among valuers. The same can be said in the case of Malaysia where there is lack of consideration on the potential impact of the underlying principle of sustainability in the market value of green commercial office buildings. As a result, these environmentally friendly buildings which take into account the factors mentioned earlier and that are implemented in their construction are not properly valued. Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate earlier attempts made by valuers to recognize the need for reviewing the valuation practices in relation to the growing number of green buildingsby exploring the global literature within the past decade. The paper presents review of literature on the impact of green features on the value of commercial office buildingby looking at those which incorporated the Concentric Ring model. The findings of this paper indicate that there is a strong relationship among all green features that affects the value of a property. However, due to lack of awareness of green building features among Malaysian valuation practitioners, the impact of green initiatives on property valuation has not been perceived clearly in the market. Hence, the highlighted <b>green</b> <b>factors</b> and their attributesin this paper could be used as a guidance to justify the consideration of green building features in valuing the green commercial office building in the future...|$|R

For this reason, SWOT analysis possesses deficiencies in the measurement and evaluation of green computing steps. Even though the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique eliminates these deficiencies, it does not allow for measuring the possible dependencies among the individual factors. The AHP method assumes that the <b>green</b> computing <b>factors</b> presented in the hierarchical structure are independent; however, this assumption may be inappropriate in light of certain situation. Therefore, it is important to utilize a form of SWOT analysis that calculates and takes into account the possible dependency among the factors. This paper demonstrates a process for quantitative SWOT analysis of green computing implementation that can be performed even when there is dependence among strategic factors. The proposed algorithm uses the analytic network process (ANP), which allows measurement of the dependency among the <b>green</b> computing implementation <b>factors,</b> as well as AHP, which is based on the independence between the factors. There are four alternatives: campus awareness program, computer procurement, increase in heat removal requirement, and increase in equipment power density for improving the implementation of green computing in campus. Dependency among the SWOT factors is observed to effect the strategic and sub-factor weights, as well as to change the strategy priorities. Based on ANC method, the best alternative for this implementation is computer procurement...|$|R
25|$|Nicklaus was {{consistently}} among {{the longest and}} straightest hitters on the PGA Tour during his prime. One early example was winning the official long drive contest at the 1963 PGA Championship with a belt of 341 yards, 17inches (312meters). This record lasted more than 20 years. He preferred the fade (left-to-right shape) for his ball flight, since this allowed the ball to stop quickly on hard and fast <b>greens.</b> Another <b>factor</b> in this decision was his distance capabilities, which were developed enough {{to allow him to}} play a fade and still reach long par fours and par fives in two shots. Nicklaus considers his longest drive in competition to be during the final round of the 1964 Masters on the 15th hole, where he had less than 160 yards left to the 500 yard par five. He hit an eight-iron slightly over the green for his second shot.|$|R
