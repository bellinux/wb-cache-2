50|$|Most {{computer}} {{operating systems}} use the terms described above. Microsoft Windows, however, describes this standard networking feature as <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing,</b> which {{acts as a}} gateway, offering a <b>connection</b> between the <b>Internet</b> and an internal network. Such a system might also act as a DHCP server. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used by networked devices (clients) to obtain various parameters necessary for the clients to operate in an Internet Protocol (IP) network. By using this protocol, system administration workload greatly decreases, and devices {{can be added to}} the network with minimal or no manual configurations.|$|R
50|$|In Windows XP, <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing</b> is {{integrated}} with UPnP, allowing remote discovery {{and control of}} the ICS host. It has a Quality of Service Packet Scheduler component. When an ICS client is on a relatively fast network and the ICS host is connected to the internet through a slow link, Windows may incorrectly calculate the optimal TCP receive window size based on the speed of the link between the client and the ICS host, potentially affecting traffic from the sender adversely. The ICS QoS component sets the TCP receive window size to the same as it would be if the receiver were directly connected to the slow link.|$|R
50|$|Windows XP was {{originally}} bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer.

Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the Internet and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help. Improvements were also made to IntelliMirror features such as Offline Files, Roaming user profiles and Folder redirection.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{operating}} {{systems such as}} Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows make it fairly easy {{to set up a}} PC as a wireless LAN [...] "base station" [...] using <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing,</b> thus allowing all the PCs in the home to access the Internet through the [...] "base" [...] PC. However, lack of knowledge among users about the security issues inherent in setting up such systems often may allow others nearby access to the connection.

50|$|Open Garden {{previously}} {{offered a}} software {{solution of the}} same name, a proprietary <b>internet</b> community-based <b>connection</b> <b>sharing</b> software application that shares internet access with other devices using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. When users have no direct <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> available within Open Garden's network, the application automatically connects to the Internet through links to other devices such as laptops or mobile phones. When the person whose <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> is being <b>shared</b> leaves the network, the application automatically detects and connects to the next best available connection by introducing a way to access the Internet over multiple channels at one time, improving speed and reliability. Such a network is self-healing and self-forming where each of the nodes operates only with local knowledge and together they build a network using a probabilistic distributed algorithm. Because Open Garden’s solution is built on software, rather than on hardware, it requires no operational expenses and minimal capital expenses from mobile operators, compared to alternatives such as femtocells and microcells.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} price {{discrimination}} is generally {{to capture the}} market's consumer surplus. This surplus arises because, in a market with a single clearing price, some customers (the very low price elasticity segment) would have been prepared {{to pay more than}} the single market price. Price discrimination transfers some of this surplus from the consumer to the producer/marketer. Strictly, a consumer surplus need not exist, for example where some below-cost selling is beneficial due to fixed costs or economies of scale. An example is a high-speed <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> <b>shared</b> by two consumers in a single building; if one is willing to pay less than half the cost, and the other willing to make up the rest but not to pay the entire cost, then price discrimination is necessary for the purchase to take place.|$|R
5000|$|Wireless Hosted Network capabilities: The Windows 7 {{wireless}} LAN service supports two new functions - Virtual Wi-Fi, {{that allows}} a single wireless network adapter to act like two client devices, or a software-based wireless access point (SoftAP) to act as both a wireless hotspot in infrastructure mode and a wireless client at the same time. This feature is not exposed through the GUI; however the Virtual WiFi Miniport adapter can be installed and enabled for wireless adapters with drivers that support a hosted network by using the command at an elevated command prompt. The wireless SoftAP can afterwards be started using the command netsh wlan start hostednetwork. Windows 7 also supports WPA2-PSK/AES security for the hosted network, but DNS resolution for clients requires it {{to be used with}} <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing</b> or a similar feature.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the Internet and the falling prices of network devices (network interface cards), it is not unusual to find multiple network devices in a computer system. Technologies such as <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> <b>sharing</b> and network address translation (NAT) are commonly being used by end users to make network connectivity more viable. In this work, we point out that this implicit redundancy can be used to achieve fault tolerance. It is known that network devices can be grouped to achieve failover support for device failures. In the context of the Internet, security against denial-of-service (DOS) attacks also becomes an important issue. While the use of multiple network devices provides a good solution for device failure, it doesn’t guarantee a good defense against DOS attacks. We show that computer systems can become tolerant to DOS attacks if some external factors are considered for network device grouping. I...|$|R
50|$|The Application Layer Gateway {{service in}} Microsoft Windows {{provides}} support for third-party plugins that allow network protocols {{to pass through}} the Windows Firewall and work behind it and <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing.</b> ALG plugins can open ports and change data that is embedded in packets, such as ports and IP addresses. Windows Server 2003 also includes an ALG FTP plugin. The ALG FTP plugin is designed to support active FTP sessions through the NAT engine in Windows. To do this, the ALG FTP plugin redirects all traffic that passes through the NAT and that is destined for port 21 (FTP control port) to a private listening port in the 3000-5000 range on the Microsoft loopback adapter. The ALG FTP plugin then monitors/updates traffic on the FTP control channel so that the FTP plugin can plumb port mappings through the NAT for the FTP data channels.|$|R

40|$|In {{the latest}} years the highly nomadic lifestyles that Internet users experience, {{and the strong}} {{entanglement}} between society and technology, lead to the appearance of community networks where the end-user has, most of the times, {{an active role in}} terms of sharing Internet access. Such networks range from basic functionality, such as the ability to create a wireless (ad-hoc) network on-the-fly with a simple PC (e. g., <b>Internet</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>Sharing</b> functionality from Microsoft), or more elaborate cases of commercial success, e. g. FON. Wireless networks provided by end-users are expected to grow, despite the limitations imposed by traditional operator-centric Internet communication models. In this new scenario the end-user (or a community of end-users) is a micro-operator in the sense that he/she shares his/her subscribed broadband Internet access based on some incentive scheme. Besides Internet access sharing, being a micro-operator also means providing other network functionality, such as local mobility management and store-cache-forward mechanisms, based on the right set of incentives as well as on adequate information concerning the way people interact and move...|$|R
