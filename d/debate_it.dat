5|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of <b>debate.</b> <b>It</b> has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much <b>debate</b> <b>it</b> was determined that the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, {{to vote in the}} royal election.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much <b>debate.</b> <b>It</b> is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E

5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. The {{alternative}} ending is included on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series {{was going to be}} commissioned, as this ending was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some <b>debate,</b> <b>it</b> was not shown.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a {{shortage}} of labour in the primary production sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some <b>debate,</b> <b>it</b> was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} <b>debate,</b> <b>it</b> was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported that the Soviets had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of <b>debate.</b> <b>It</b> has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
