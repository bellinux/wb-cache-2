40|$|Louvers may be {{generally}} {{described as a}} series of vertical slats placed in a diagonal line across the migratory path of downstream migrating fish. Each slat is set at right angles to the direction of flow. The migrants, upon approaching the slats, tend to avoid them while continuing downstream and are thus guided to a bypass at the downstream end of the louver line. In 1957, 1958, and 1959 tests were conducted on an experimental louver installation on the Puntledge River in an attempt to provide a satisfactory {{solution to the problem of}} screening downstream migrating chinook salmon fry (Oncorhyncus tshawytscha) from the water <b>intake</b> <b>canal</b> of the Puntledge River powerhouse.

The surface bypasses were located laterally along the intake atone end of the trashrack. The mean bypass discharges varied from 0. 4 to 4 m 3 /s, or an averageof 2 to 8 % of the turbine discharge. The efficiency of the devices was evaluated by the markrecapturetechnique.

Depending on the site, themean bypass efficiency was found to be between 17 and 80 %. Behaviour of fish in the vicinity ofthe trashrack and the bypass seemed to be largely influenced by the flow pattern. Poor hydraulicconditions (turbulence, strong acceleration, upwellings) and insufficient discharge were identifiedthrough direct and video observations as being responsible for many aborted passages at thebypass entrances. The results suggest that siting of surface bypass systems must take into account flow patterns inboth the trashrack area and <b>intake</b> <b>canal.</b> It is suggested that surface bypasses associated withexisting trashracks may be an acceptable mitigation technology at small-scale hydroelectricprojects where {{it is not necessary to}} guarantee a highly efficient downstream passage protection...|$|E

Les vitesses de dévalaison dans les canaux d'amenée de Pointis (1, 9 à 4, 2 km/h) et de Camon (2, 5 à 7 km/h) sont positivement corrélées aux vitesses de l'écoulement. An experiment was conducted in 1998 at the Pointis water intake, on the Garonne River, to define location for a future downstream bypass for Atlantic salmon smolts. The study of the movements of 28 radiotagged smolts revealed that under low hydraulic conditions (flow velocities < 0. 5 - 0. 6 m/s), the smolts maintain their position for a significant time (median time greater than one day) in the <b>intake</b> <b>canal,</b> despite the large spacing (5 cm) between {{the bars of the}} trashrack. During this time, they explore the whole area of the <b>intake</b> <b>canal</b> above the trashrack. A light placed on the left bank just upstream from the trashrack concentrated the fish on the same bank as the lamp, {{in the vicinity of the}} lighted area. The proportion of fish passing downstream from the Rodère dam itself was estimated. This dam, located downstream from the Pointis plant, supplies the Camon hydroelectric powerhouse. It appeared that the proportions of smolts passing through the Rodere dam were related to the ratio of discharge at the dam to the total Garonne flow : 70 % of the smolts passed by when the discharge at the dam corresponded to 40 - 50 % of the total Garonne flow. The time taken by radiotagged smolts to go from the Pointis plant to the Camon powerhouse (5. 4 km) varied from 1 hour 17 minutes to 12 days with a median value of more than one day, and depended on river discharges.

40|$|Abstract. —The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the extent to which a computer-driven process can be used to {{classify}} sonar images. The data we present come from a feasibility study for a hydroacoustic monitoring system aimed at the automatic detection of downstream-migrating adult American eels Anguilla rostrata in the <b>intake</b> <b>canal</b> of a small hydroelectric station. The images were collected by a dual-frequency identification sonar with sufficient resolution to show the distinct shape and swimming motion of eels, and thus to allow confident visual identification. The goal was to find a set of image processing, tracking, and pattern recognition techniques that would reproduce the results of the visual classification. Of the three classification methods that we tested with our example data set, neural network analysis had the lowest misclassification rate for eels (7 % of the eels being misclassified as debris) and the second-lowest misclassification rate for debris (5 % of the debris being misclassified as eels). Discriminant function analysis misclassified 12 % of the eels as debris and 4 % of the debris as eels. A K-nearest-neighbor analysis initially provided the poorest results (17 % misclassified eels and 12 % misclassified debris). However, after applying an algebraic correction, K-nearest-neighbor analysis yielded an accurate estimate of the number of eels in the data set. We discuss the value of flagging cases of uncertain classification, how image processing and feature selection can affect the results, and how the numeric ratio of the targets present determines what error rates ar...|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "leuconoid" [...] pattern boosts pumping {{capacity}} further by filling the interior almost completely with mesohyl {{that contains a}} network of chambers lined with choanocytes and connected {{to each other and}} to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. Leuconid sponges grow to over 1 m in diameter, and the fact that growth in any direction increases the number of choanocyte chambers enables them to take a wider range of forms, for example [...] "encrusting" [...] sponges whose shapes follow those of the surfaces to which they attach. All freshwater and most shallow-water marine sponges have leuconid bodies. The networks of water passages in glass sponges are similar to the leuconid structure.In all three types of structure the cross-section area of the choanocyte-lined regions is much greater than that of the intake and outlet channels.

40|$|Safe, {{effective}} downstream fish passage {{has been}} {{a high priority for}} both hydropower and fisheries managers for several decades. Many technologies have been evaluated. These include physical structures (such as inclined planes and screens), sound (in various forms), lights, and other techniques (e. g. bubble barriers) in attempts to guide downstream-moving fish away from irrigation and hydropower-related water <b>intake</b> <b>canals.</b> This paper focuses on the use of mild, electric gradients (innovative applications of pulsed DC) to control downstream fish behavior and movements. While most deployments of Graduated-Field Fish Barriers (GFFBs) have been used for upstream deterrence, several evaluations have been conducted on attempts to direct downstream-moving fish, where approach velocities have not exceeded about 0. 5 m sec- 1. Three examples are highlighted. The first involves a GFFB installation to reduce juvenile salmon entrainment into an irrigation canal on the Sacramento River, CA. Despite poor barrier siting and river flows directed toward the intake, entrainment of downstream-moving, juvenile Chinook salmon was reduced by up to 79 %. The second example is a recently installed downstream barrier to keep adult salmonids from entering the Gunnison Tunnel, an irrigation diversion near Montrose, CO (that will soon address hydropower needs.) The third example involves controlled, laboratory-raceway trials on the “transformer” life stage of invasive sea lamprey at the USGS Hammond Bay Biological Station in Michigan. Preliminary data show that very low voltage, graduated fields of pulsed DC successfully guided 55 - 74 % of the downstream-migrating sea lamprey transformers into a mock trap at the downstream end of the raceway (at four different water velocities). An innovative, hybrid-design concept is proposed for future downstream guidance of fish. The concept involves graduated, pulsed-DC electric fields in concert with low-frequency acoustics (using pulse-pressure, seismic water-gun technology to elicit a fright response and move fish around water intakes upstream of GFFB arrays). This combination of approaches may be key to achieving high levels of success in future downstream fish guidance applications. Once fully tested, this tandem approach may be a useful tool for managers who desire novel ways to enhance downstream fish passage outcomes...|$|R
