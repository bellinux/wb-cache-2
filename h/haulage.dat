5|$|A few special {{passenger}} services were subsequently operated, notably in 1969, 1983 and 1992/93. In 1993, Octel's daily freight traffic {{was transferred to}} road <b>haulage,</b> for safety reasons, and traffic thus ceased on the line. The Octel plant closed in 2003, and has since been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Ofotbanen Drift AS, trading as Ofotbanen, was a Norwegian {{passenger}} and freight railway company. The company {{operated a}} fleet of six locomotives, three multiple units, 22 passenger and 48 freight cars. The sole service was the passenger train Unionsexpressen between Oslo and Stockholm; it had previously offered freight <b>haulage</b> on contract.|$|E
5|$|The Middleton Railway, a {{preserved}} heritage steam railway, operates from {{headquarters and}} museum at Moor Road Hunslet to Park Halt. It is operated by volunteers. From Middleton, Park Halt is accessed by a footpath that was originally a waggonway. The railway celebrated its 200th anniversary of steam <b>haulage</b> in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Yeates Removals was {{established}} in 1910 using horses and carts for general <b>haulage</b> in Clevedon and the surrounding areas. The removals company has always been run by family members and is currently headed up by James Griffin who took over from his father John in 2001.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight <b>haulage</b> would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
5|$|Autolink has {{traditionally}} owned a large pool of autoracks. These have been {{operated by the}} Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, {{and at the same}} time signed a <b>haulage</b> contract with them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70new autoracks for NOK175 million.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} road <b>haulage</b> had drawn away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.|$|E
5|$|Cargolink has a {{fleet of}} five shunters at their port in Drammen, in {{addition}} to three Di6 diesel locomotives and three TRAXX electric locomotives for main <b>haulage.</b> While the shunters are owned by Cargolink, the diesel locomotives are leased from Dispolok of Germany and the electric locomotives are leased from Hector Rail. It also has more than 100closed autoracks for automobile transport, and 60container cars. 70new autoracks are under delivery from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Hollinwood Branch of the Ashton Canal was a canal {{that ran}} from Fairfield in Droylsden, through Littlemoss and Daisy Nook Country Park to the Hollinwood area of Oldham, with a branch from Daisy Nook to the Fairbottom Branch Canal. The canal was mainly {{used for the}} <b>haulage</b> of coal until it fell into disuse for {{commercial}} traffic in the 1930s. It included four aqueducts and a two-rise lock staircase.|$|E
5|$|The Rochdale Canal—one of {{the major}} navigable broad canals of Great Britain—passes along Milnrow's {{north-western}} boundary which divides it {{from the village of}} Wardle and districts of Belfield and Castleton in Rochdale. The Rochdale Canal was historically used as a highway of commerce for the <b>haulage</b> of cotton, wool, and coal to and from the area.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable <b>haulage</b> {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from road <b>haulage</b> to the point at which coal deliveries were the only significant business.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{reorganisation}} {{of public}} transportation by the Labour government of Clement Attlee, the LPTB {{was scheduled to be}} nationalised along with the majority of British railway, bus, road <b>haulage</b> and waterway concerns from 1 January 1948. In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new British Transport Commission which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to be abolished and replaced by the London Transport Executive. Lord Latham, a member of the LPTB and the incoming chairman of the new organisation, acted as temporary chairman for the last two months of the LPTB's existence.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal <b>haulage.</b> All coal hauled on the Tramway needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had to raise prices to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E
5|$|Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in {{the early}} 1900s {{carrying}} timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the gas works and local paper mills. In 1923 they bought their first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport {{and after the war}} were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into <b>haulage,</b> setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The Clydesdale is a {{breed of}} draught horse named for and {{derived from the}} farm horses of Clydesdale, a county in Scotland. Although {{originally}} {{one of the smaller}} breeds of draught horses, it is now a tall breed. Often bay in color, they show significant white markings due to the presence of sabino genetics. The breed was originally used for agriculture and <b>haulage,</b> and is still used for draught purposes today. The Budweiser Clydesdales {{are some of the most}} famous Clydesdales, and other members of the breed are used as drum horses by the British Household Cavalry. They have also been used to create and improve other breeds.|$|E
5|$|The TVR {{line would}} {{dominate}} the transportation of coal throughout the Rhondda's industrial history, and its monopoly {{was a point}} of contention, as with no rivals the colliery owners could not negotiate for <b>haulage</b> rates. Several {{attempts were made to}} break the monopoly including the opening of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, between 1885 and 1895, which linked Blaenrhondda {{at the head of the}} Rhondda Fawr to the Prince of Wales Dock. To achieve this rail link the Rhondda Tunnel was constructed through Mynydd Blaengwynfy to Blaengwynfi; at the time the longest railway tunnel in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The line {{opened on}} 12 July 1904 {{and at the}} opening there were {{delivered}} two six-axle steam locomotives from Hartmann, which were named Lier and Hole. The railway also took delivery of two passenger cars, a combined freight and conductor car, {{and a number of}} freight cars. Periodically the railway needed extra <b>haulage</b> power, and therefore sometimes leased locomotives from the Norwegian State Railways. The initial fares were NOK1.30 from Lier to Svangstrand, while the ferry across the lake cost an additional NOK1.50. The greatest ridership was during the summer, when tourists took the line to reach the steam ships. During winter, the ridership fell, and the railway terminated at Sylling instead of Svangerstrand.|$|E
5|$|Although closed, {{the line}} was not lifted, and was {{maintained}} as a long siding until 1972, {{on behalf of the}} Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy <b>haulage</b> company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that would do the main <b>haulage</b> from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It was plain that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope <b>haulage</b> was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road <b>haulage</b> and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of the goods yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the BS The railway was planned to run entirely underground from the junction of New Street (now Melcombe Street) and Dorset Square west of Baker Street to James Street (now Spur Road) {{on the south side of}} Waterloo station. From Baker Street, the route was to run eastwards beneath Marylebone Road, then curve to the south under Park Crescent and follow Portland Place, Langham Place and Regent Street to Piccadilly Circus. It was then to run under Haymarket, Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue before passing under the River Thames to Waterloo station. A decision had not been made between the use of cable <b>haulage</b> or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train <b>haulage</b> contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, {{a new report}} from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen had severe safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, and was not performing safety analysis. Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt that the issues taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none of the procedures criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Shaw and Crompton is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Shaw and Crompton had {{a railway}} line and station between 1863 and 2009, opened initially for <b>haulage,</b> but later used for passenger and commuter journeys. Shaw and Crompton railway station {{was used by}} passenger trains running between Rochdale and Manchester on the Oldham Loop Line. After initially being rejected in the early 2000s, plans to turn the line into part of the light-rail Metrolink system were accepted by the government on 6 July 2006. Shaw and Crompton railway station closed on 3 October 2009, {{so that it can}} be converted from use with heavy rail to Metrolink. Shaw and Crompton Metrolink station opened on 16 December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Figard {{spent the}} summer of 1995 working {{at a hotel in}} Fordingbridge, Hampshire, where her cousin Jean-Marc was head waiter, using the {{opportunity}} to improve her English. She returned to the UK in December to spend another two weeks with Jean-Marc. After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local <b>haulage</b> firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by the driver of a white Mercedes lorry. Bouvier had reservations about the driver, but let her go with him nonetheless. Figard left the service station with the driver at around 4:30 pm. She never arrived at her destination, and was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway (HStP). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross. The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street, Rosslyn Hill, Haverstock Hill and Chalk Farm Road to Camden Town and then under Camden High Street and Hampstead Road to Euston Road. The route then continued south, following Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross Road and King William Street (now William IV Street) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand. North of Euston Road, a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under Drummond Street to serve the main line stations at Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. Stations were planned at Hampstead, Belsize Park, Chalk Farm, Camden Town, Seymour Street (now part of Eversholt Street), Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Agar Street, Euston and King's Cross. Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable <b>haulage</b> or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains, a power station was planned on Chalk Farm Road close to the London and North Western Railway's Chalk Farm station (later renamed Primrose Hill) which had a coal depot for deliveries.|$|E
5|$|When Nicola feels {{down about}} Simon moving on, {{she decides to}} seduce Ivan. He rebuffs her {{advances}} but she tells Lesley, Rodney and Laurel that she slept with Ivan. When Ivan tries to get the truth, she convinces everyone else that he lying. Paul refuses to speak to Ivan and makes his father throw Nicola out of her home. She then tells Laurel that she lied about the whole thing. Laurel then tells everyone inside the pub that Nicola has lied and Ivan refuses to accept everyone's apologies. Rodney thinks that Ivan and Paul should get back together and lets the whole pub know. Ivan is annoyed but then realises he is right. When Ivan asks Paul for another chance, he turns him down and Ivan leaves the village. When he returns, Simon is annoyed with him for leaving him {{to pay the rent}} on Mulberry Cottage. He forgives him when Ivan reveals that he is just back for his job. He is made <b>haulage</b> manager for Matthew and Sadie's new business after they poach him. However, the job soon ends and along with Simon they leave Emmerdale for a new life in Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and the refusal to allow steam <b>haulage,</b> which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to improve the situation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new port facility at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter, and the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E
