40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing {{system for a}} high-speed cryogenic gas expander generator is presented. The expander represents {{a new class of}} such devices that, in contrast to the earlier technologies, makes use of the expanding gas energy by converting it into electrical power. The {{magnetic bearing}} and generator constitute a functionally complete unit {{that can be used in}} a variety of gas expanders utilizing different <b>expander</b> <b>wheels</b> and operating at various speeds. In order to obtain a compact design and increase rotor first bending frequency, the axial magnetic bearing is designed to have different pole areas on different sides of the thrust disk. This results in different load capacities in different directions, matching operational conditions of the unit. Regardless this anisotropy, the bearing features linear force vs current dependence. Radial and angular suspension of the rotor is achieved using two patented homopolar PM-biased radial bearings. The paper discusses design and analysis of these bearings. In spite of the three-dimensional nature of the electromagnetic problem, combination of analytical solution and 2 D FEA was found to be an adequate tool for the bearing analysis. Theoretical predictions of the bearing performance have been found to be in a good agreement with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 1 - 14 A {{series of}} {{failures}} of radial inflow hot gas expander driving a centrifugal compressor in a nitric acid plant plagued the second author?s former company over a 24 year period. The 19, 000 hp single-stage radial inflow expander inlet and discharge blade tips would fail in service, destroying the inlet nozzle vanes and expander wheel, and causing extensive {{damage to the}} rotor, bearings, seals, and shrouds. To finally resolve this severe reliability problem, an engineering team consisting of both authors? company's personnel was formed to pinpoint {{the root cause of}} failure and develop a corrective action plan. A parametric solid model of the expander wheel was created, and forced response stress and modal analyses were conducted on various design configurations using finite element techniques. Impact resonance testing of several <b>expander</b> <b>wheels</b> was performed to validate the results of the finite elements modal analyses. Design changes were implemented based on the analyses and a new expander wheel was manufactured. The startup procedures of the machine were also modified and heat treatments on the expander material were optimized. The new expander wheel has operated successfully with the geometric and operational startup procedure changes without a failure, resulting in record service life to date. This paper chronicles the history of these failures, expander design optimization studies and changes, operating procedure changes, and heat treatment changes for the A 286 wheel material. The paper also documents the operational reliability attained in current operations, providing a validation of the engineering. Though the application of the engineering is unique for this case, the methods used in this investigation and problem resolution can be readily applied to numerous root cause failure analyses of rotating machinery...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} the {{electrical}} power required by refrigeration systems is relevant worldwide. It is evaluated {{in the order of}} 15 % of the total electricity production taking refrigeration and air-conditioning into consideration. For this reason, in the last years several energy saving techniques have been proposed to reduce the power demand of such plants. The paper deals with the development of an innovative internal recovery system for cryogenic cooling plants. Such a system consists in a Compressor-Expander Group (CEG) designed {{on the basis of the}} automotive turbocharging technology. In particular, the paper is focused on the design of the expander, the critical component of the CEG system. Due to the low volumetric flow entering the expander and the high expansion ratio, a commercial turbocharger <b>expander</b> <b>wheel</b> was strongly modified. It was equipped with a transonic nozzle, designed to have a radially inflow full admission. To verify the performance of such a machine and suggest improvements, two different set of nozzles have been designed and modelled by means of the commercial Ansys-CFX software. In the paper, steady-state 3 D CFD simulations of the second-generation prototype are presented and compared with the initial ones...|$|R

Design improvements and technology innovations associated with inflow radial turbine, turbo expander, {{have been the}} main motivation for the improved and more productive ethylene plant processes. The early process design {{that was based on}} Jule Thompson expansion valve was replaced by the process designs that utilize several stages of expander -compressor or expander- generators. The latest technology innovation that was embraced by the ethylene plant engineering companies and the owners was expander-compressor with active magnetic bearings. The early applications of expander-compressor with magnetic bearings began in the 1980 ?s. The present product improvement activities by turbo expander suppliers are to reduced number of expansion stages. High head and low flow coefficient <b>expander</b> <b>wheel</b> as well as high peripheral speed wheels are being developed to achieve the latter objective. The next innovative technology that is knocking at the door of ethylene plants is expander - high speed permanent magnet generator with magnetic bearings.

Basic components in cryogenic Turbo <b>expander</b> are Turbine <b>wheel,</b> brake Compressor, shaft, nozzle, Thrust bearing, Journal Bearing etc. In expansion Turbine Temperature of gases decreases due to expansion and produces coldest level of Refrigeration. This project is all about Computational Fluid flow analysis of high speed rotating turbine. This involves with the three dimensional analysis of flow through a radial expansion turbine, using nitrogen as flowing fluid. Cfd packages, Bladegen, Turbogrid and CFX are used to carry out the analysis. Bladegen is used to create the model of turbine using available data of hub, shroud and blade profile. Turbogrid is used to mesh the model. CFX-Pre is used to define the physical parameters of the flow through the Turbo expander. CFX-Post is used for examining and analyzing results. Using these results variation of different thermodynamic properties like Temperature, Pressure, density, velocity etc inside the turbine can be seen.
