50|$|The {{central issue}} here is {{frequency}} of the incoming signal. A plasma will simply reflect radio waves below a certain frequency (characteristic <b>electron</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency).</b> This is the basic principle of short wave radios and long-range communications, because low-frequency radio signals bounce between the Earth and the ionosphere and may therefore travel long distances. Early-warning over-the-horizon radars utilize such low-frequency radio waves (typically lower than 50 MHz). Most military airborne and air defense radars, however, operate in VHF, UHF, and microwave band, which have frequencies higher than the characteristic plasma frequency of ionosphere, therefore microwave can penetrate the ionosphere and communication between the ground and communication satellites demonstrates is possible. (Some frequencies can penetrate the ionosphere).|$|E

Since electrons with {{positive and negative}} parallel (v-parallel) velocities have different sources and experience different interactions with the large-scale electromagnetic fields, the electron distribution function near v-parallel = 0 should possess considerable structure, including the possibility of velocity space holes, i. e., regions where the phase space density is zero, and sharp discontinuities. A particular hole distribution, which may occur upstream of slow shocks in the distant geomagnetic tail, is shown to support a nonstandard plasma wave mode with frequencies between the ion and <b>electron</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequencies</b> and parallel phase speed above the ion, but well below the electron, thermal speed. The hole mode can be destabilized by a positive slope in the low parallel velocity electron distribution, and the growth rate is strongly enhanced if the electron parallel temperature exceeds the perpendicular temperature; the mode can also be excited by a hot, fast ion beam. The hole modes exist only for a narrow range of propagation angles about the magnetic field direction...|$|R

Thus an ion matrix Debye sheath which is depleted of electrons forms around it. The negatively biased substrate will accelerate the ions within a time scale of the inverse ion plasma frequency ωi−1 ( [...] ~ 10−6 sec). This ion movement lowers the ion density in the bulk, which causes the sheath-plasma boundary to expand in order to sustain the applied potential drop,in the process exposing more ions. The plasma sheath expands until either a steady-state condition is reached, which is called Child Langmuir law limit; or the high voltage is switched off {{as in the case}} of Pulsed DC biasing. Pulse biasing is preferred over DC biasing because it creates less damage during the pulse ON time and neutralization of unwanted charges accumulated on the wafer in the afterglow period (i.e. after the pulse has ended). In case of pulsed biasing the TON time of the pulse is generally kept at 20-40 µs, while the TOFF is kept at 0.5-2 ms i.e. a duty cycle of 1-8%. The power supply used is in range of 500 V to hundreds of KV and the pressure in the range of 1-100 mTorr. This is the basic principle of the operation of immersion type PIII.|$|E
50|$|Plasmas {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} values in both {{temperature}} and density; plasma temperatures range from close to absolute zero and to well beyond 109 kelvins (for comparison, tungsten melts at 3700 kelvins), and plasma may contain less than one particle per cubic metre, or be denser than lead. Electron temperature is usually expressed as electronvolt (eV), and 1 eV is equivalent to 11,604 K. Common plasmas temperature and density in fluorescent light tubes and semiconductor manufacturing processes are around several eV and 109-12per cm3. For a wide range of parameters and frequencies, plasma is electrically conductive, and its response to low-frequency electromagnetic waves {{is similar to that of}} a metal: a plasma simply reflects incident low-frequency radiation. Low-frequency means it is lower than the characteristic <b>electron</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>frequency.</b> The use of plasmas to control the reflected electromagnetic radiation from an object (Plasma stealth) is feasible at suitable frequency where the conductivity of the plasma allows it to interact strongly with the incoming radio wave, and the wave can either be absorbed and converted into thermal energy, or reflected, or transmitted depending on the relationship between the radio wave frequency and the characteristic plasma frequency. If the frequency of the radio wave is lower than the plasma frequency, it is reflected. if it is higher, it transmit. If these two are equal, then resonance occurs. There are also another mechanism where reflection can be reduced. If the electromagnetic wave passes through the plasma, and is reflected by the metal, and the reflected wave and incoming wave are roughly equal in power, then they may form two phasors. When these two phasors are of opposite phase they can cancel each other out. In order to obtain substantial attenuation of radar signal, the plasma slab needs adequate thickness and density.|$|E

40|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} microscopic superconductivity theory, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) theory has a very peculiar prediction: at zero temperature, {{only a fraction of}} electrons within an energy shell form Cooper pair and condense, but all electrons participate to form a macroscopic superfluid and contribute to the superfluid density (inverse square of penetration depth). Very recently, this prediction was challenged by directly measuring the penetration depth upon doping in overdoped cuprates. (Bozovic et al., 2016) Here, we show that such a counter-intuitive prediction of BCS theory is not right.
