5|$|After Tech's kickoff was downed {{in the end}} zone, the Longhorns' offense began a new {{drive from}} their 20-yard line. Brown threw an <b>incomplete</b> pass, then {{completed}} a first-down pass to Adams at the 32-yard line. From there, Brown threw an <b>incomplete</b> pass, then tossed a 15-yard screen pass to Fitzgerald, who gained a first down at the Texas 42-yard line. Williams crossed into Virginia Tech territory on the next play as he ran straight ahead for a 13-yard gain. A one-yard run was followed by an <b>incomplete</b> pass, and on third down Brown threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech defender Torrian Gray, who returned the pass to the Tech 33-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Having {{earned a}} first down with the final play of the first quarter, Drew Weatherford and the Florida State offense ran into {{difficulty}} as the second quarter began. An <b>incomplete</b> pass and a rush for no gain were followed by a false start penalty and another <b>incomplete</b> pass, and Florida State was forced to punt. Virginia Tech recovered the ball at its 26-yard line, but failed {{to capitalize on the}} defensive stop. Marcus Vick threw two <b>incomplete</b> passes and was sacked before Virginia Tech was forced into a punt.|$|E
5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to start running out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do <b>incomplete</b> passing plays. Suggs gained nine yards on a run up the middle, then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after an <b>incomplete</b> pass by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw an <b>incomplete</b> pass, and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E

5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An <b>incomplete</b> pass on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After an <b>incomplete</b> pass, Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an <b>incomplete</b> pass. This was followed by another <b>incomplete</b> pass, and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. An <b>incomplete</b> pass on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E

This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with <b>incomplete</b> injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an <b>incomplete</b> injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
