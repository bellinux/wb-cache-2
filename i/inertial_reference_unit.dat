25|$|After {{detailed}} {{forensic analysis}} of the FDR data, the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software and the air data <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> <b>unit</b> (ADIRU), {{it was determined that}} the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude {{at the time of the}} incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the high-AOA protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.|$|E
