The traditional ITQ design, that allocates rights to only the harvesting sector, unintentionally <b>expropriates</b> wealth/property <b>interests</b> from the co-dependent-processing sector. This regulatory expropriation is a substantive policy flaw that renders the traditional ITQ design constitutionally suspect and subject to attack in the courts on grounds that such policy would require "just compensation" under the Fifth Amendment. The expropriation mechanism is briefly outlined following a reflective glance at the origins of ITQ policy. Then, this expropriating ITQ policy is shown to be at opposing purposes with, and even partially induced by, prior to government fishery policies. Finally, arguments underlying a Fifth Amendment takings claim are set {{in the context of}} four strands of judicial precedent...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence on ownership structures and corporate diversification by analysing 355 public listed companies (PLCs) in Malaysia. The {{majority of the}} companies in the sample have an ultimate controlling owner, particularly an individual or family. As controlling owners have on average, rights of control over {{a greater percentage of}} shares in any given company than their rights to participate in the cash flows from that company, controlling owners may have an incentive to <b>expropriate</b> minority <b>interests</b> through methods such as inefficient corporate diversification. The risk of such expropriation would be expected to be reflected in the value of highly diversified companies. The results of the research provide no evidence to support the argument that diversification reduces the value of companies. However, the finding is consistent with the argument that high control rights of controlling owner might encourage expropriation of minority interests through corporate diversification strategies. Thus, corporate diversification in Malaysia is perceived as a mixed blessing strategy...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{empirical}} evidence supports the wealth expropriation {{hypothesis that the}} controlling shareholder(s) tend to <b>expropriate</b> minority <b>interests,</b> which in turn reduces corporate value. However, it is still unclear whether corporate financial distress is related {{to this type of}} expropriative behavior. To answer this question, we adopt three variables to proxy for the risk of expropriation by the controlling shareholder, namely, the percentage of directors occupied by the controlling shareholder, the percentage the controlling shareholders shareholding pledged for bank loans?pledge ratio?, and the deviation of control away from cash follow rights. Binary logistic regressions are then fitted to generate dichotomous prediction models. Taiwanese listed firms, characterized by a high degree of ownership concentration similar to that in most countries, are used as our empirical samples. The evidence suggests that the three variables mentioned above are positively related to the risk of financial distress, even after controlling for the possible influence of financial performance. It is also found that corporate governance deteriorates a year before the financial distress occurs. Generally speaking, firms with weak corporate governance are vulnerable to economic downturns and the probability of falling into financial distress increases when corporate governance deteriorates. An immediate implication follows that any early warning system cannot be complete without incorporating corporate governance variables...|$|R

Though the now strongly conservative Calles thought he could control him, it quickly became clear Cárdenas would not accept a subordinate role like his predecessors did. After establishing himself in the presidency, in 1936 Cárdenas had Calles and dozens of his corrupt associates arrested or deported to the United States. Cárdenas became perhaps Mexico's most-popular 20th-century president and most renowned for <b>expropriating</b> the oil <b>interests</b> of the United States and European petroleum companies in the run-up to World War II.

One of the most significant modifications was lowering the limit on the size of holdings and providing flexibility in accordance with the productivity of the land. The new ceilings on landownership were set at between 15 and 55 hectares on irrigated land and 80 and 300 hectares on rain-fed land, depending on the area and rainfall. Land in excess of the ceilings was to be expropriated within five years.

40|$|Purpose Substantial {{previous}} researches {{find that}} corporate diversification lead to value erosion. Agency theory was an often-cited explanation to rationale decision maker's motivations toward diversification. With 144 Chinese public companies from the Small and Medium board in Shenzhen Stock Exchange, I explain how agency problems motivate Chinese public firms to diversify. Data and methodology Sample firms used in my analysis are selected from Small and Medium board in Shenzhen Stock Exchange. I {{collect data on}} the number of business segments in which the listed firm operates in, segment sales data, and some financial figures from Worldscope database. Owner identity and shareholdings of ultimate controller are manually collected from sample firms' annual reports. Managerial and institutional ownership are collected from Wind database. Several OLS regression was executed to analyze their impacts on the diversification level. Findings Firstly, I find a significant negative relation exists between managerial ownership and diversification level. This indicates that as the shareholdings of management increase, interests between manager's and shareholder become more aligned, and thus managers are less likely to adopt value-reducing diversification. Second, cash-flow right which proxy the equity stakes of ultimate controller are negatively between cash-flow right of ultimate controller's and diversification level for my sample firms. This provide the evidence on the align effects of interests between ultimate controller and minority shareholders. Third, I document a positive relation between the divergence between the cash-flow right and voting right of ultimate controller's and diversification level. When block holders hold much more voting power than their claims to the cash-flows, they tend to <b>expropriate</b> minority <b>interest</b> via diversification...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether the level of bad debt provisions of financial institutions is affected by internal governance mechanisms (IGMs) from the perspective of the Type II principal-principal (PP) conflicts between the controlling shareholders and the minority shareholders. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors’ sample covers all listed financial institutions in China, comprising a panel data set of 139 firm-year observations covering 1999 to 2009. Within China’s two-tier corporate governance context, the three IGMs – ownership structure, board of directors and supervisory board – are measured to examine the level of bad debt provisions. FINDINGS: The findings suggest that state ownership and legal person ownership are negatively related to the level of bad debt provisions, but board size reveals a positive association. Other factors including foreign ownership, independent directors, board meeting, supervisory board size and supervisory board meeting were found to have no impact. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The spirit of corporate governance reform has not been transferred to financial institutions sufficiently. The board of directors and supervisory board actually act the roles of “window dressing” or “rubber stamp” within the current two-tier system. From the Type II PP perspective, the controlling shareholders are found to moderate the conflicts between other parties but they still <b>expropriate</b> the <b>interests</b> of minority shareholders and are the real beneficiaries of recent reforms. Thus, further financial reforms seem necessary in China. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper provides an empirical analysis of factors that underlie IGMs during an important period of regulatory change and organizational reform, and fills a literature gap concerning the effectiveness and efficiency of financial institutions.

5000|$|In {{the era of}} Deng Xiaoping, a {{fundamental}} legal source of the regime of property and property rights in the PRC lay in the Constitution of PRC enacted in 1982. The 1982 constitution provided for the [...] "socialist public ownership" [...] {{of the means of}} production, which takes two forms- state ownership and collective ownership. In 2004, the fourth amendment to the constitution was made. Article 13 of the constitution provided that: [...] "The lawful private property of citizens shall be inviolable. The country shall protect in accordance with law citizens' private property rights and inheritance rights. The country may, as necessitated by public <b>interest,</b> <b>expropriate</b> or requisition citizens' private property and pay compensation therefor." [...] It can thus be seen that China's property laws have been undergoing developments. The most recent development would be the enactment of the Property Law in March 2007 (after 14 years of debates), which is noted {{as one of the most}} important core components of the evolving civil law in the PRC.|$|R

50|$|During the {{presidency}} of revolutionary general Lázaro Cárdenas del Río, the controversy over petroleum again flared. Standard Oil had major investments in Mexico and a dispute between the oil workers and the company was {{to be resolved via}} the Mexican court system. The dispute, however, escalated, and on March 18, 1938, President Cárdenas used constitutional powers to <b>expropriate</b> foreign oil <b>interests</b> in Mexico and created the government-owned Petroleos Mexicanos or PEMEX. Although the United States had had a long history of interventions in Latin America, the expropriation did not result in that. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was implementing the Good Neighbor Policy, in which the U.S. eschewed the role of intervention and courted better relations with the region, which would be vital if another major conflict broke out in Europe. However, with the Great Depression, the United States implemented a program of expelling Mexicans from the U.S. in what was known as Mexican Repatriation.When the U.S. did enter World War II, it negotiated an agreement with Mexican President Manuel Avila Camacho to be allies in the conflict against the Axis powers. The U.S. bought Mexican metals, especially copper and silver, but also importantly implemented a labor agreement with Mexico, known as the Bracero Program. Mexican agricultural workers were brought under contract to the U.S. to do mainly agricultural labor as well as harvesting timber in the northwest. The program continued in effect until 1964 when organized labor in the U.S. pushed for ending it.|$|R
40|$|Initial {{public offerings}} (IPO) are an {{important}} topic which has attracted tremendous attention in corporate finance research over the last decades. Quite different from other mature markets, the Chinese IPO market {{is characterized by a}} weak legal system and poor governance standards. As part of a transition economy, the Chinese IPO market is also severely regulated by government and subject to intervention by a rigid authority. This unique institutional setting enables us to investigate the effects of institutional features of Chinese firms, such as political connections, the involvement of different private equity and disproportionate ownership structure, on the IPO process of Chinese non-state-owned enterprises (Non-SOEs). First, this thesis examines the value of political capital in the Chinese IPO market. I find a positive relationship between a politically connected executive and the probability of IPO approval of Non-SOEs. I further identify that shareholders value those connections, and give a market premium to the connected firms after the firms go public. This study also provides evidence that other types of political connections through external sources, such as politically connected sponsors and PE investors, also bring benefits to the firms in their IPO approval, and these connections substitute the effect of the executive’s political connections on IPO approval, but they are not endorsed by minority shareholders. Therefore, I argue that in emerging markets where government intervention is still prevalent, political capital does create value and Non-SOEs usually build political capital to facilitate their access to the IPO market, although other types of political capital do not bring further benefits into the post- IPO market. Given that the involvement of PE investors facilitates firms accessing the IPO market (as shown in chapter 2), I argue that PEs are able to do so because of their political connections, however no direct evidence is provided. Therefore I tried to investigate how PEs’ political connections/reputation impact the IPO process of Chinese Non-SOEs. Through my empirical studies, I find that although PEs’ reputation offers some explanation of the IPO approval rate of Chinese Non-SOEs, its marginal effect is less than PEs’ political connections, indicating that PEs’ role in helping firms to access the IPO market is mainly driven by its political connections rather than reputation. In addition, I document that PEs’ reputation rather than political connections is acknowledged by minority shareholders in the secondary market. I provide further evidence that foreign PEs are more likely to monitor managerial behavior by taking seats in the board, which is welcomed by the post-IPO market. The findings of this study support the institutional view of the PE industry. Particularly, politically connected PEs reduce the information asymmetry between regulators and firms through their political connections, but foreign PEs are more reputable and play a certification role which reduces the agency conflicts between controlling and minority shareholders. Finally, an important feature of Chinese listed firms is the wide existence of a disproportionate ownership structure, which has been found to facilitate the exploitation of minority investors by controlling shareholders, especially in emerging markets where the protection of minority shareholders is weak. However, there is no evidence from the IPO market about whether firms with disproportionate ownership underperform or outperform other IPOs. Using a large sample of Chinese newly listed Non-SOEs, this study provides evidence that a disproportionate ownership structure facilitates the exploitation of minority investors by controlling shareholders. The findings show that IPOs with disproportionate ownership structure underperform those without on three-year post-IPO buy-and-hold returns (BHAR) and cumulative abnormal returns (CAR), respectively, and IPOs with disproportionate ownership structure experience greater declines in operating performance post IPO. This underperformance is robust to various accounting-based performance measures and different holding horizons. I also identify that the underperformance of IPOs with disproportionate ownership structure are partly driven by their higher likelihood of undertaking value-destroying related party transactions than those without. The results further indicate that initial return of IPOs with disproportionate ownership structure is significantly lower than those without. The evidence suggests that in a non-state-owned firm with disproportionate ownership structure, minority shareholders face a high likelihood of expropriation by ultimately controlling shareholders in IPOs, resulting in a discount in market valuation of the IPOs with disproportionate ownership structure. Overall, this thesis examines the effects of institutional features of Chinese firms, including political connections, the involvement of different private equity and disproportionate ownership structure, on the IPO process of Chinese Non-SOEs. This thesis provides evidence that, due to the heavy government intervention in the Chinese IPO market, politically connected executives, politically connected sponsors and PE investors have a significantly positive effect on IPO approval. Although the political connections of domestic PEs play a more important role in the IPO process than the reputable PEs, reputable PEs reduce information asymmetries and mitigate agency problems for their portfolio firms better than their domestic equivalents do by providing a closer monitoring service. The empirical evidence also indicates that in emerging markets where the investor protection system is still weak, ultimately controlling shareholders of newly listed Non-SOEs with disproportionate ownership structure usually <b>expropriate</b> the <b>interests</b> of minority shareholders...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{ownership}} and control {{has been a}} major topic in corporate finance research area over the past decade, ever since the disproportionate ownership structure was documented. In these firms the agency conflict between controlling and minority shareholders begins to dominate (Claessens et al., 2002; Djankov et al., 2008; Faccio et al., 2010), rather than the classic agency conflict between managers and shareholders (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). In this new agency theory framework, the value destroying effect of disproportionate ownership has been widely documented in various countries and institutional settings. Like firms in other East Asian countries, most Chinese firms, especially those entrepreneurial firms have such a disproportionate ownership structure, function in an institutional environment characterised by a weak legal system, low quality government, and a prevalent relationship. This unique institutional setting enables us to explore the specific channels used by controlling shareholders to obtain resources to expropriate, and which eventually decrease firm value. On this basis this thesis mainly investigates the financial implications of disproportionate ownership that are prevalent in the Chinese market. Thesis consists of the following four main research questions. First, this study examines the effect that a disproportionate ownership structure has on the leverage policy of Chinese entrepreneurial firms, using NTS reform as a natural experiment. The findings show that Chinese firms with disproportionate ownership structure adopt a high leverage policy in order to obtain more financial resources for expropriation rather than investment. I also provide evidence that both the high leverage and controlling shareholders’ expropriation reduced after the NTS reform when controlling shareholders’ incentive to expropriate is alleviated. Furthermore, such a reduction is expected and welcomed by minority shareholders so {{they are more likely to}} have a positive reaction to the announcement of related party transactions after the NTS reform. Whereas the controlling shareholders of firms with disproportionate ownership structure are found to adopt a high leverage policy for expropriation, a further matter of concern is: what is the channel through which controlling shareholders are able to obtain and retain a high leverage policy? So I further examine the effect of political connections on the disproportionate ownership structure-leverage relationship. The empirical evidence indicates that political connections facilitate controlling shareholders’ expropriation by giving firms better access to debt financing. In addition, I find that a politically connected chairman plays a more important role in facilitating controlling shareholders’ expropriation under China’s institutional environment, and that better creditor protection weakens the positive relationship between disproportionate {{ownership and}} leverage, but this effect only exists in firms without political connections. Given that controlling shareholders in Chinese entrepreneurial firms use political connections to obtain more resources from the private financial market (debt market) to expropriate, then how do they expropriate in the IPO market, and what is the channel through which they expropriate in the IPO market? In order to answer these questions, I further examine the implication of disproportionate ownership structure in the IPO market. I find that the controlling shareholders of firms with disproportionate ownership structure have a stronger incentive to push the firms go public, so they are more likely to manipulate the earnings and seek PE investors before IPO. While the involvement of PE investors does help those firms accessing the IPO market, PE-backed firms with disproportionate ownership structure also have a higher IPO fee, a lower initial return and a lower long term post-IPO performance. In other words, both controlling shareholders and PE investors are the winners while the minority shareholders are the only losers. Finally, disproportionate ownership may also have an influence on stock market liquidity because this ownership structure is usually associated with an information asymmetry problem which impairs the quality of information disclosed in these firms. Therefore, this thesis also examines whether the disproportionate ownership structure influences stock market liquidity. The findings confirm that firms with disproportionate ownership structure have lower stock market liquidity than firms without. I further show that such a negative relationship between disproportionate ownership structure and market liquidity is strengthened when the agency problem is more severe, and is weakened after the NTS reform. Overall, this thesis examines the implication of disproportionate ownership structure in the Chinese market, and how such an implication is influenced by institutional factors. The empirical evidence indicates that in emerging markets where the investor protection system is still weak, controlling shareholders of firms with disproportionate ownership structure usually have a strong incentive to <b>expropriate</b> the <b>interests</b> of both creditors and minority shareholders. And it is such expropriations that cause a firm with a disproportionate ownership structure to adopt a higher leverage policy, and higher IPO approval and lower market liquidity than a firm without. This thesis also provides evidence that due to the huge government intervention in the Chinese market, political connections provide an important channel through which controlling shareholders expropriate. While PE investors through their political connections play a conspiratorial role rather than monitoring role in the Chinese market: controlling shareholders seek PE investors to gain access to the IPO market, in return for which they secure benefits for the PE investors, while the interests of minority shareholders are actually destroyed. A disproportionate ownership structure also impairs stock market liquidity because it weakens the information asymmetry and results in poor disclosure of information in these firms. However, this thesis suggests that the process of privatisation in an emerging market, such as the NTS reform in the Chinese market, can alleviate the controlling shareholders’ incentive to expropriate...|$|R
