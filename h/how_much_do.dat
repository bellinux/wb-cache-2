This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we spent so far, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> we have left to spend?

That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E

500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It puts pressure on the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> you earn, we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E
