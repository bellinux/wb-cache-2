5000|$|In {{order for}} a {{permanent}} defect to be produced from initially perfect crystal lattice, the kinetic energy that it receives [...] must be larger than {{the formation energy of}} a Frenkel pair. However, while the Frenkel pair <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> in crystals are typically around 5-10 eV, the average threshold displacement energies are much higher, 20-50 eV. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the defect formation is a complex multi-body collision process (a small collision cascade) where the atom that receives a recoil energy can also bounce back, or kick another atom back to its lattice site. Hence, even the minimum threshold displacement energy is usually clearly higher than the Frenkel pair formation energy.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{synthesized}} Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures {{in different}} geometric configurations such as nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts and nanosheets are {{usually in the}} wurtzite crystal structure. However, it was found from density functional theory calculations that for ultra-thin films of ZnO, the graphite-like structure was energetically more favourable {{as compared to the}} wurtzite structure. The stability of this phase transformation of wurtzite lattice to graphite-like structure of the ZnO film is only limited to the thickness of about several Zn-O layers and was subsequently verified by experiment. Similar phase transition was also observed in ZnO nanowire when it was subjected to uniaxial tensile loading. However, {{with the use of the}} first-principles all electron full-potential method, it was observed that the wurtzite to graphite-like phase transformation for ultra-thin ZnO films will not occur in the presence of a significant amount of oxygen vacancies (Vo) at the Zn-terminated (0001) surface of the thin film. The absence of the structural phase transformation was explained in terms of the Coulomb attraction at the surfaces. The graphitic ZnO thin films are structurally similar to the multilayer of graphite and are expected to have interesting mechanical and electronic properties for potential nanoscale applications. In addition, density functional theory calculations and experimental observations also indicate that the concentration of the Vo is the highest near the surfaces as compared to the inner parts of the nanostructures. This is due to the lower Vo defect <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> in the interior of the nanostructures as compared to their surfaces.|$|E

Background. This work {{is related}} to the {{theoretical}} calculation of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> in the context of finding an answer to two unsolved questions. Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy.</b> Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> and entropy of vacancy formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free <b>energy</b> of vacancy <b>formation</b> and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Methods. The vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a quasi-harmonic approximation. Results. It was shown, that the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> is compensated by the vibrational vacancy formation entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature. Such underestimation is related to certain problems in quasi-harmonic approximation. ????????????. ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ? ?????? ???? ???????. ??-??????, ??? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ????????. ??-??????, ???????????? ?????????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????????, ??? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ?? ???????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ?? ??????????? ? ???? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????????????? ???????????. ???????? ??????????. ???????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ? ???

40|$|The {{two most}} desired {{properties}} for photo-detection using a strained-layer superlattice (SLS) are high native point defect (NPD) <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> and absence of mid-gap levels.

Since the defects with much higher formation energy in SLS will be difficult to form, their energy levels in the SLS mini-gap will have little effect on device performance, even if the defect states lie in mid-gap.
