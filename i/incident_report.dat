40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess attitudes toward and use of an {{electronic}} adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system in all four hospitals in one NHS Scotland Health Board area. A questionnaire was used to assess Medical Consultants', Managers', and Nurses' attitudes and perceptions about electronic adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting.</b> Actual adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> data were also analysed. The main findings from this study are that Consultants, Managers, and Nurses all had positive attitudes about responsibility for <b>reporting</b> adverse <b>incidents.</b> All respondents indicated that the design of and information collected by the electronic adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system (DATIX) was adequate but Consultants had more negative attitudes and perceptions than Managers and Nurses about DATIX. All respondents expressed negative attitudes about the amount and type of feedback they receive from reporting, and Consultants expressed more negative attitudes about how DATIX is managed than Managers and Nurses. Analysis of adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> data found that the proportion of Consultants using DATIX to <b>report</b> <b>incidents</b> was significantly lower than that of Managers and Nurses. The findings suggest that there are no additional barriers to <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> associated with the use of a bespoke electronic adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system as compared to other types of systems. Although an electronic adverse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system may be able to increase <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> and facilitate organisational learning by making it easier to <b>report</b> <b>incidents</b> and analyse <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> data, strong leadership within hospitals / healthcare professions (or healthcare subcultures) is still required in order to promote and sustain <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> to improve patient safety...|$|R

25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an <b>incident</b> <b>report.</b> He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of <b>incidents</b> <b>reported</b> after introduction of a voluntary, non-punitive <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system for neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Netherlands; and to investigate which types of <b>reported</b> <b>incident</b> pose the highest risk to patients in the NICU. DESIGN: Prospective multicentre survey. METHODS: Voluntary, non-punitive <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> was introduced in eight level III NICUs and one paediatric surgical ICU. An incident was defined as any unintended event which (could have) reduced the safety margin for the patient. Multidisciplinary, unit-based patient safety committees systematically collected and analysed <b>incident</b> <b>reports,</b> and assigned risk scores to each <b>reported</b> <b>incident.</b> Data were centrally collected for specialty-based analysis. This paper describes {{the characteristics of}} <b>incidents</b> <b>reported</b> during the first year. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify high-risk incident categories. RESULTS: There were 5225 <b>incident</b> <b>reports</b> on 3859 admissions, of which 4846 were eligible for analysis. Incidents with medication were most frequently reported (27 %), followed by laboratory (10 %) and enteral nutrition (8 %). Severe harm was described in seven <b>incident</b> <b>reports,</b> and moderate harm in 63 <b>incident</b> <b>reports.</b> <b>Incidents</b> involving mechanical ventilation and blood products {{were most likely to}} be assigned high-risk scores, followed by those involving parenteral nutrition, intravascular lines and medication dosing errors.

40|$|Background: <b>Incident</b> <b>reporting</b> {{is widely}} used in both patient safety {{improvement}} programmes, and in research on patient safety. Objective: To identify the key requirements for <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems in primary care; to develop an Internet-based <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> and learning system for primary care. Methods: A literature review looking at the purpose, design and requirements of an <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system (IRS) was used to update an existing <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system, widely used in Germany. Then, an international expert panel with knowledge on IRS developed the criteria {{for the design of}} a new web-based <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system for European primary care. A small demonstration project was used to create a web-based reporting system, to be made freely available for practitioners and researchers. The expert group compiled recommendations regarding the desirable features of an <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system for European primary care. These features covered the purpose of reporting, who should be involved in reporting, the mode of reporting, design considerations, feedback mechanisms and preconditions necessary for the implementation of an IRS. Results: A freely available web-based reporting form was developed, based on these criteria. It can be modified for local contexts. Practitioners and researchers can use this system as a means of recording patient safety incidents in their locality {{and use it as a}} basis for learning from errors.

[...] An Iraqi policeman went over to the car possibly to help the passenger, but the vehicle kept moving and it looked to the guards as if the policeman was pushing it. In their view, this confirmed that they were under attack by a vehicle bomb, whereupon they fired at the car, killing both people in it as well as the Iraqi policeman. In response to the guards' killing of the Iraqi policemen, other Iraqi police officers began to fire at the Blackwater men.

40|$|Hospitals {{can apply}} {{prospective}} and retrospective methods {{to reduce the}} large number of medical errors. Retrospective methods are used to identify errors after they occur and to facilitate learning. Prospective methods aim to determine, assess and minimise risks before incidents happen. This paper questions whether the order of implementation of those two methods influences the resultant impact on <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> behaviour. From November 2007 until June 2008, twelve wards of two Dutch general hospitals participated in a quasi-experimental reversed-treatment non-equivalent control group design. The six units of Hospital 1 first conducted a prospective analysis, after which a sophisticated <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> and analysis system was implemented. On the six units of Hospital 2 the two methods were implemented in reverse order. Data from the <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> and analysis system and from a questionnaire were used to assess between-hospital differences regarding the number of <b>reported</b> <b>incidents,</b> the spectrum of <b>reported</b> <b>incident</b> types, and the profession of reporters. The results show that carrying out a prospective analysis first can improve <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> behaviour in terms of a wider spectrum of <b>reported</b> <b>incident</b> types and a larger proportion of <b>incidents</b> <b>reported</b> by doctors. However, the proposed order does not necessarily yield a larger number of <b>reported</b> <b>incidents.</b> This study fills an important gap in safety management research regarding the order of the implementation of prospective and retrospective methods, and contributes to literature on <b>incident</b> <b>reporting.</b> This research also builds on the network theory of social contagion.

40|$|BACKGROUND Patient safety, {{reducing}} {{medical errors}} and risk management {{have become a}} global public health and administrative issue. Population-based studies {{around the world have}} alerted high rates of preventable medical errors and deaths. In response, a global effort agreed on a World Health Assembly resolution on patient safety. The World Alliance for Patient Safety guideline and the Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety have been launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) to galvanize and facilitate efforts by all Member States to make health care safer. The guidelines introduced adverse event reporting and focus on reporting and learning to improve the safety of patient care. The WHO suggested a conceptual framework for patient safety providing comprehensive understanding of the domains of patient safety. It represents a continuous learning and improvement cycle emphasizing on proactive (identification of risk, prevention, detection, reduction of risk) and reactive (incident recovery, system resilience) risk management. The ultimate measure of a successful <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system is whether the information it yields is used appropriately to improve patient and organization safety. OBJECTIVES To systematic review literature to determine <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems improve patient outcomes and organization outcomes, and to identify successful characteristics of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system which information it yields is used appropriately to improve patient and organization safety, and to investigate if the <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system can serve as an interface to support the (inform and influence) information flows in the WHO’s Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety. METHODS Two bibliography databases, Medline and Embase via OvidSP, were systematically searched using search keywords of ‘incident reporting’, ‘patient / organization outcomes’. Quality appraisal, data extraction were conducted on literature which met the inclusion criteria. Narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS A total of 584 citations were initially identified and 6 studies were finally included in this systematic review. The methodological quality of the 6 included studies was generally average to poor. The 6 included studies could be classified into 3 groups by research question and intervention strategies examined 1) case series on <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system; 2) comparison study on two main streams of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems: routine <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system versus structured case note / chart review; and 3) review of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems. Successful characteristics of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system identified including confidential, non-punitive, expert analysis, system-oriented, responsive, standardized taxonomy coding, clarified and unified concepts of <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system, voluntary reporting, facilitation reporting, proper training and health informatics infrastructure support. Quantitative and qualitative evidences were identified that <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system could serve as an interface to support inform and influence types of information flows in the WHO’s Conceptual Framework for the ICPS. However, no evidence could be found that <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems could directly improve patient outcomes and organization outcomes. CONCLUSION This systematic review found no evidence that <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems could directly improve patient outcomes and organization outcomes, but the systems could serve as an interface to support information flows in the WHO’s Conceptual Framework for the ICPS. Successful characteristics of an <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> system were identified coherent to the WHO’s recommendations. Future studies can further examine the causation relationship between <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems and the process components by applying the Donabedian’s structure-process-outcome model. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} information security <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> systems in the wider context of an information security management system. This work is based on four group model building workshops with participants from mnemonic AS, a Norwegian Managed Security Services Provider. We found that <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> is a crucial component in creating information security awareness among information system users. Our research indicates that increasing <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> rates {{does not necessarily mean}} poor security, but rather that the organisation is becoming more security aware, and, arguably, less exposed to information security risks. However, in an organisation with poor awareness, it is possible that <b>incident</b> <b>reporting</b> rates and risk increases simultaneously. Analogous results are known about industrial safety reporting systems and risk of organisational accidents...|$|R
