5|$|In 2003, the <b>Free</b> <b>Expression</b> Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far too broad and harmed <b>free</b> <b>expression</b> of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{non-deterministic}} call-by-need (untyped) lambda calculus lambda nd with a constant choice and a let-syntax that models sharing. Our main result is that lambda nd has the nice operational properties of the standard lambda calculus: confluence on sets of expressions, and normal order reduction is sufficient to reach head normal form. Using a strong contextual equivalence we show correctness of several program transformations. In particular of lambdalifting using deterministic maximal <b>free</b> <b>expressions.</b> These results show that lambda nd is a new and also natural combination of non-determinism and lambda-calculus, which {{has a lot of}} opportunities for parallel evaluation. An intended application of lambda nd is as a foundation for compiling lazy functional programming languages with I/O based on direct calls. The set of correct program transformations can be rigorously distinguished from non-correct ones. All program transformations are permitted with the slight exception that for transformations like common subexpression elimination and lambda-lifting with maximal <b>free</b> <b>expressions</b> the involved subexpressions have to be deterministic ones...|$|R
