50|$|Kleinrock's {{career in}} wrestling {{began at the}} age of 16 when he went to work for Slammers Wrestling Federation (SWF) based out of Sun Valley, California. Kleinrock {{performed}} various roles with the SWF including time <b>keeper,</b> <b>ring</b> announcer, program writer, and even brought Slammers to his high school for a fundraiser wrestling show. While working at Slammers, he became friends with Darren McMillan who wrestled as Dynamite D. In 1996, Kleinrock and Slammers parted ways when he headed off to college at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Shortly thereafter, McMillan {{and a number of other}} wrestlers who had left Slammers over the years formed tho Dynamite Wrestling Organization, and after an unscripted shoot angle on an SWF show, the Slammers roster split. McMillan, along with former Slammers referee Patrick Hernandez and Kleinrock, formed Southern California Championship Wrestling (SCCW).|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the mechanism described is to automatically jettison a rocket nozzle element {{at the conclusion of}} boost in order to achieve a cruise mode nozzle configuration for the balance of powered flight. The boost nozzle is retained by latched pistons that are mechanically secured until released by chamber pressure, which simultaneously assumes retention of the nozzle by holding the primary piston in place. Upon attainment of cruise mode, the chamber pressure drops, allowing springs to overcome the primary piston force and pull the <b>keeper</b> <b>ring</b> forward to free the nozzle for jettison by motor exhaust...|$|E

She {{is dressed in}} a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and <b>keeper</b> <b>rings.</b> Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a {{sprouting}} moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.) ...|$|R
50|$|Of {{particular}} note {{were the}} efforts of Lighthouse <b>keepers</b> who <b>rang</b> bells for many days, trying to ward mariners and their vessels off the shoal as they groped through {{the smoke from the}} many fires — 1871 Great Chicago Fire, Peshtigo Fire, Northern Michigan including large tracts around Manistee, Michigan, Western Michigan around Holland and the fire in the Thumb near Port Huron—that took place beginning October 8, 1871, casting an impenetrable pall across Lake Michigan {{for the better part of}} a week. However, many vessels were lost.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be seen}} in the below chart what {{a typical}} I-V curve looks like for a hollow cathode in {{electron}} emission mode. Given a certain <b>keeper</b> geometry (the <b>ring</b> in the figure above that the electrons exit through), ion flow rate, and Vp, the I-V profile can be determined. 111-113.|$|R
5000|$|The essay {{finishes}} {{with the}} departure of the <b>Keepers</b> of the <b>Rings</b> from the Grey Havens (at the end of The Lord of the Rings) and then the sailing of the Last Ship of the Eldar ever to leave Middle-earth. Thus, [...] "an end had come to the Eldar, of story and of song".|$|R
5000|$|Following {{months of}} {{action by the}} Forest Keepers, {{including}} prosecutions, tensions {{came to a head}} when a [...] "howling mob" [...] (Chelmsford Chronicle, 25 September 1891) marched to the Flats. Forest Keepers and mounted police were deployed and Forest <b>Keepers</b> arrested the <b>ring</b> leaders leading to their imprisonment. Following this, tensions and hostilities started to lessen over the following months.|$|R
5000|$|Banished from Orbis are the Space Jumpers, the protectors of the <b>Keepers</b> and the <b>Rings.</b> These mysterious {{beings have}} been absent from Orbis {{for so long}} that they are almost legendary among the Orbisians. Space Jumpers are greatly feared by Citizens, for Space Jumpers have an ability to [...] "jump" [...] through Space and Time. It is this {{combination}} of mystique and close affiliation with the Keepers that has brought about their exile.|$|R
50|$|Ceremonial {{paraphernalia}} in Filipino weddings {{include the}} arrhae, the candles, the veils, the cord, and wedding rings. The ring bearer {{acts as the}} holder and <b>keeper</b> of the <b>rings</b> until the exchanging of rings is performed, while the coin bearer acts as the holder and keeper of the arrhae until it is offered and given by the groom to his bride. Among the secondary sponsors or wedding attendants, three pairs - each pair consists of a male and a female secondary sponsor - are chosen to light the wedding candles, handle the veils, and place the cord.|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} began with Stone Cold Steve Austin kicking Dude Love {{out of the}} ring and when he returned, diving on him with a Lou Thesz press. After not {{managing}} a single piece of offensive attack on Austin, Dude Love ran up the walkway to leave but Austin caught up behind him with a running clothesline from behind and after Love tried to escape up onto the band stand, Austin threw him off onto the concrete arena floor. After fighting back down to the ringside, Love finally managed to subdue Austin, catching him staggering out of the turnbuckle with a bulldog and following with an elbow drop. As Austin tried to recover he was caught in a rear naked body scissors choke as Vince McMahon came down to ringside. Eventually Austin managed to escape, elbowing Love in the face but he instantly gestured towards McMahon and Love rolled him up for a pin that only made the two count. Using the ring posts to attack Love's legs, Austin took the fight outside but was soon made to regret it after a reversed piledriver saw him falling onto the concrete ramp. By focussing again on McMahon, Love attacked Austin from behind and when a suplex from the apron failed, he instead pulled him down into a cutter on the top rope. Inside the ring Love applied an abdominal stretch, with McMahon ordering the time <b>keeper</b> to <b>ring</b> the bell (which he did not do) but Austin reversed into his own abdominal stretch until he fell fowl to a hip toss. Austin continued by dragging Love outside the ring and suplexing him onto the steel steps and briefly fighting through the crowd before returning to the ring. Love then stood in the corner warming up for Sweet Shin Music but Austin caught his leg and span him round. Love tried to clothesline him and caught the referee instead. Austin then tried a stunner but instead walked into the mandible claw which took him down to the floor. When Love tried to reapply the hold on a recovering Austin he was back tossed outside of the ring and followed by Austin who grabbed a chair but was held back by McMahon. When he escaped McMahon's grip he turned into a punch, through the chair, from Love. Austin quickly recovered though and punched Love twice and as McMahon tried to help him up, Austin swung the chair and hit McMahon before rolling Love into the ring, giving him a stunner and counting his own three count. Austin celebrated his victory, as EMTs came down to attend to McMahon, and left the arena. Gerald Brisco then informed Howard Finkel that Austin had been disqualified and thus Dude Love won the match while the medics tended to McMahon while the event closed.|$|R
