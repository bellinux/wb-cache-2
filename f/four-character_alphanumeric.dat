5000|$|The [...] "" [...] is the PDB identifier. Each {{structure}} {{published in}} PDB receives a <b>four-character</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> identifier, its PDB ID. (This {{cannot be used}} as an identifier for biomolecules, because often several structures for the same molecule - in different environments or conformations - are contained in PDB with different PDB IDs.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Geschwaders, {{other than}} day fighters, {{during the war}} usually bore a four-character {{identification}} code, starting with a two-character alphanumeric [...] (a code unique to each Geschwader) {{to the left of}} the national Balkenkreuz marking and two letters to the right, signifying the individual aircraft's letter within its Staffel as the third letter and the Staffel-designating letter within the Geschwader as the fourth and last letter. The full four-character code was usually shown on the fuselage sides, sometimes with the individual aircraft letter repeated under the wings. Gruppe and Staffel-sized units could also have their own unique codes of this type, most often used for reconnaissance and maritime aviation groups and Wekusta weather observation squadrons, with Staffel sized units using the <b>four-character</b> <b>alphanumeric</b> code almost always using an [...] "H" [...] as the fourth and last character. Late in the war, the first two characters of the Geschwaderkennung code (designating the geschwader) were depicted on the fuselage sides in a much reduced size, possibly as a [...] "low-visibility" [...] security measure. The code tended (though not always), to be omitted altogether by 1945.|$|E

50|$|Until 1935, {{civilian}} aircraft {{only had}} a registration painted on. This was usually the letter D (for Deutschland) national identification letter in use from before 1928, followed by three or four numbers. After 1935, military planes carried, on the fuselage, an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>four-character</b> Geschwaderkennung code with the Balkenkreuz after the first two characters, always consisting of one letter and one number in a unique combination for a specific Geschwader or Gruppe. The third letter always designated the individual aircraft ID within a Staffel, while the fourth letter designated the Staffel itself within the larger Geschwader or Gruppe unit it belonged to.|$|R
