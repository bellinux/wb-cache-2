40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Hungary has {{experienced}} more foreign bank entry than {{any country in}} world, starting with foreign greenfield operations and then followed by the privatization of four of its largest banks to strategic foreign owners. Currently about two thirds of all banking assets in Hungary are foreign owned; the only major bank without a foreign owner is Országos Takarékpénztár és Kereskedelmi Bank (OTP). During a decade in which lending to households declined in real terms until recently and household deposits remained relatively steady at around 20 % of GDP, OTP lost its monopoly in retail banking to foreign-owned banks. By {{the end of the}} decade, OTP held shares of just over 50 % in both household deposit and credit markets. In {{the last half of the}} decade, foreign banks increased substantially their market shares and currently hold more than 40 % of all household deposits and about 40 % of all loans to households. In this paper, we identify the important role played by foreign greenfield operations in intermediation within the household sector, especially from 1997. We provide evidence that, once they take control of formerly state-owned banks, strategic foreign investors move aggressively into retail banking. As the decade came to a close, retail banking was a growth industry in Hungary and foreign-owned banks were actively participating in both markets. Foreign entry provided healthy competition to OTP and prodded this widely held <b>domestically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>bank</b> to develop new products and better services for Hungarian households. Over the last half of the decade, bank cards have been introduced to Hungarian households and transactions using these cards have grown by a factor of more than five. Over half of the population uses bank cards twice a month on average, almost exclusively for cash withdrawals from their current accounts. By investing heavily in information technology and using its extensive branch network, OTP has become the market leader in this new, growing business with more than 40 % of all ATMs and bank cards issued in Hungary and more than 70 % of all bank card transactions. Our analysis of OTP's behavior indicates that domestically controlled banks with local expertise may have a significant role to play in retail banking in small, open transition (or emerging) economies. hungarian banking, retail banking in emerging markets, foreign bank entry...|$|E

The positive productivity effects of FDI are more pronounced for plants that buy more intermediates and who purchase science-based intermediate inputs (i. e., electronics, machinery and equipment, and chemicals).

Of the two rudder control techniques considered, rudder used with the aileron in <b>controlling</b> <b>bank</b> angle increasd stability and produced satisfactory responses; the combined bank angle and sideslip control task does not warrant further consideration because of the task difficulty and the small improvement indicated in airplane closed-loop response with this technique...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>banking</b> {{supervision}} in <b>controlling</b> <b>bank</b> risk. Banking supervision is {{measured in terms of}} enforcement outputs (i. e., on-site audits and sanctions). Our results show an inverted U-shaped relationship between on-site audits and bank risk, while the relationship between sanctions and risk appears to be linear and negative. We also consider the combined effect of effective supervision and banking regulation (in the form of capital and market discipline requirements) on bank risk. We find that effective supervision and market discipline requirements are important and complementary mechanisms in reducing bank fragility. This is in contrast to capital requirements, which prove to be rather futile in <b>controlling</b> <b>bank</b> risk, even when supplemented with a higher volume of on-site audits and sanctions. ...|$|R

Empirical research was conducted for the period 2003 - 2010, yielding with the total of 1, 430 observations. Empirical findings based on dynamic panel analysis indicate that ownership concentration variable- CR 4 is negatively related with performance, i. e. listed firms with dispersed ownership perform better than firms with concentrated ownership. Also, the research indicated that foreign controlled listed firms perform better than <b>domestically</b> <b>controlled</b> firms.

We construct a simple theoretical model of how foreign ownership may affect these extensive margins of exports and take this model to data from Germany, one of the leading actors on the world market for goods. In line with theoretical predictions we find that foreign-owned firms do export more goods to more countries after controlling for firm size, productivity and industry affiliation. These differences between foreign-owned firms and <b>domestically</b> <b>controlled</b> firms are highly statistically significant, and they are large from an economic point of view, with foreign-owned firms exporting up to 39 % more goods to up to 31 % more countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between bank ownership structure and risk-taking. We find robust evidence that the greater risk taking incentives of stockholder <b>controlled</b> <b>banks</b> (compared to managerially <b>controlled</b> <b>banks)</b> are more pronounced for the set of banks with larger asset size, lower stock-return volatility, and lower balance-sheet-risk characteristics. Considering that the probability of failure for these banks is relatively low, these results may suggest that the efficacy of insider ownership in mitigating the agency problem could {{be affected by the}} costs perceived by the managers associated with aligning their interests with outside stockholders (i. e., the expected loss of benefits from control of the firm in the event of failure).

30|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, firm size and age were negatively correlated with intensive margin job creation, while more productive firms exhibited higher employment growth rates. One percent larger and older firms showed job creation rates that were on average approximately 7.5 and 5.4 percentage points lower than {{for the rest of}} the surveyed firms. A one percent increase in TFP, by contrast, enabled on average about 3.9 percentage points higher intensive margin employment growth. Moreover, productivity differentials were more crucial for job creation among the surveyed firms during the economic crisis than during the preceding years. Firms that are controlled by foreign owners were also able to perform relatively well. Accordingly, the average employment growth rate in existing subsidiaries of multinational corporate groups exceeded that in <b>domestically</b> <b>controlled</b> firms by approximately 4.0 percentage points.|$|R
