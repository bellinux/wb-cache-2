40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose To {{explore the}} {{usefulness}} of conventional tests for assessing spatial neglect and contrast these tests with daily challenges encountered by patients after discharge from rehabilitation to home. Methods A mixed method prospective study of 15 patients with neglect after a right hemisphere stroke, 51 month after discharge to home. Data were obtained from: (1) Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), (2) star cancellation and <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> and (3) observations and interviews. Qualitative data were analysed with content analysis and quantitative data with non-parametric statistics. The data were presented in a ‘mixing matrix’ and integrated by ‘following threads’. Finally, a synthesis was written into a vignette. Results The CBS significantly underestimated fluctuations and did not capture important items of neglect. The star cancellation and <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> did not identify neglect in mildly affected participants. Left starting point in the star cancellation and a characteristic process of drawing in <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> were observed in all participants. Conclusion Traditional numerical interpretations of paper-pencil tests inadequately confirmed mild neglect.

40|$|Deficits in {{the ability}} to draw objects, despite {{apparently}} intact perception and motor abilities, are defined as constructional apraxia. Constructional deficits, often diagnosed based on performance on <b>copying</b> complex <b>figures,</b> have been reported in a range of pathologies, perhaps reflecting the contribution of several underlying factors to poor figure drawing. The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of brain-behavior relationships in drawing disorders based on data from a large cohort of subacute stroke patients (n = 358) using whole-brain voxel-wise statistical analyses linked to behavioral measures from a complex <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> task. We found that (i) overall poor performance on <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> was associated with subcortical lesions (BG and thalamus), (ii) lateralized deficits with respect to the midline of the viewer were associated with lesions within the posterior parietal lobule, and (iii) spatial positioning errors across the entire figure were associated with lesions within visual processing areas (lingual gyrus and calcarine) and the insula. Furthermore, deficits in reproducing global aspects of form were associated with damage to the right middle temporal gyrus, whereas deficits in representing local features were linked to the left hemisphere lesions within calcarine cortex (extending into the cuneus and precuneus), the insula, and the TPJ. The current study provides strong evidence that impairments in separate cognitive mechanisms (e. g., spatial coding, attention, motor execution, and planning) linked to different brain lesions contribute to poor performance on complex <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> tasks. The data support the argument that drawing depends on several cognitive processes operating via discrete neuronal networks and that constructional problems as well as hierarchical and spatial representation deficits contribute to poor <b>figure</b> <b>copying...</b>|$|R

Implications for Rehabilitation Findings demonstrate that identification of spatial neglect and the way symptoms of neglect impact on daily life functioning of stroke patients must be carefully pursued by health-care professionals working in stroke rehabilitation. Areas that should receive professional attention in the rehabilitation process include: preparing patients and their family for fluctuations related to neglect in the patient's own home, locating issues that might impact safety, and identifying unique factors that either enhance or diminish neglect within each patient's daily life context. The results of this study could be used to develop more wide-ranging assessment strategies to assist health-care professionals in identifying neglect after hospital discharge, for instance by expanding existing ecological assessment tools and including qualitative evaluation of test performance in paper-pencil tests, such as the star cancellation and <b>figure</b> <b>copying...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{tool for}} {{standardized}} and repeated neuropsychological assessments {{in patients with}} idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is needed. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a computerized neuropsychological test battery designed for INPH and to evaluate its reliability, validity and patient's ability to complete the tests. METHODS: Based on a structured review of the literature on neuropsychological testing in INPH, the eight tests most sensitive to the INPH cognitive profile were implemented in a computerized format. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was also included. Tests were presented on a touch-screen monitor, with animated instructions and speaker sound. The battery was evaluated with the following cohorts: A. Test-retest reliability, 44 healthy elderly; B. Validity against standard pen and pencil testing, 28 patients with various cognitive impairments; C. Ability to complete test battery, defined as completion of at least seven of the eight tests, 40 investigated for INPH. RESULTS: A. All except the <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> test showed good test-retest reliability, r[*]=[*] 0. 67 - 0. 90; B. A high correlation was seen between conventional and computerized tests (r[*]=[*] 0. 66 - 0. 85) except for delayed recognition and <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> task; C. Seventy-eight percent completed the computerized battery; Patients diagnosed with INPH (n[*]=[*] 26) performed worse on all tests, including depression score, compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A new computerized neuropsychological test battery designed for patients with communicating hydrocephalus and INPH was introduced. Its reliability, validity for general cognitive impairment and completion rate for INPH was promising. After exclusion of the <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> task, the battery is ready for clinical evaluation and as a next step we suggest validation for INPH and a comparison before and after shunt surgery.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the effects of}} galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) on an individual who, following right hemisphere stroke, is unable to <b>copy</b> <b>figures</b> accurately. His <b>copies</b> contain most of the constituent elements, but are poorly integrated and drawn in a seemingly haphazard manner. To test whether GVS could help overcome these difficulties, we administered the Rey-Osterrieth complex <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> task while manipulating both the presence and laterality of the galvanic signal. The signal was applied {{at a level that}} was too low to elicit sensation which ensured that the individual was unaware of either when or on what side he was being stimulated. Relative to a sham condition, two consecutive blocks of GVS increased both the accuracy with which the main configural elements of the figure were reconstructed, and there was some, albeit less consistent evidence, that these were drawn in a more wholistic as opposed to piecemeal manner. Improvement was not reliant on the polarity of the stimulating electrodes. These results suggest that GVS can help overcome difficulties in the perception and/or reconstruction of hierarchical visual form, and thereby uncover a new link between vestibular information processing and visual task performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} draw objects {{is a complex}} process {{depending}} on an array of cognitive mechanisms including routines for spatial coding, attention and the processing of both local and global features. Previous studies using both neuropsychological and neuroimaging data have reported hemispheric asymmetries in attending to local versus global features linked {{to a variety of}} cortical loci. However, it has not been examined to date whether such asymmetries exist at the level of white matter pathways sub-serving global/local attention. The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of brain-behaviour relationships in the processing of local versus global features based on data from a large cohort of sub-acute stroke patients (n =  248) and behavioural measures from a complex <b>figure</b> <b>copy</b> task. The data analysis used newly developed methods for automated delineation of stroke lesions combined with track-wise lesion deficits procedures. We found (i) that reproduction of local features in <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> was supported by a neural network confined to the left hemisphere, consisting of cortical loci within parietal, occipital and insular lobes and interconnected by the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and (ii) that global feature processing was associated with a right hemisphere network interconnected by the third branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the long segment of the perisylvian network. The data support the argument that asymmetrical white matter disconnections within long–range association pathways predict poor complex figure drawing resulting from deficits in hierarchical representation. We conclude that hemispheric asymmetries in attending to local versus global features exist on the level of both cortical loci and the supporting white matter pathways...|$|R

Their entropy in natural time is smaller than that, $S_u$, of a ``uniform'' distribution. The same holds for their entropy upon time-reversal. This behavior, as supported by numerical simulations in fBm time series and in an on-off intermittency model, stems from infinitely ranged long range temporal correlations and hence these signals are probably Seismic Electric Signals (critical dynamics). The entropy fluctuations are found to increase upon approaching bursting, which reminds the behavior identifying sudden cardiac death individuals when analysing their electrocardiograms.

40|$|AbstractComplex <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> is a {{commonly}} used neuropsychological test. Here we explored the neural {{basis of the}} factors underlying complex <b>figure</b> <b>copying</b> (CFC), {{using data from the}} Birmingham Cognitive Screen (BCoS) in a large group of sub-acute, ischemic stroke patients (239). We computed two analyses: in the first we assessed the contribution of co-morbid deficits (i. e. in gesture processing, object use, visual neglect, pictures naming and sustained attention) to the lesions associated with CFC. In a second analysis a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to isolate different underlying task components and to link to clinical neuroimaging scans. A voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis showed that poor CFC performance was associated with lesions to bi-lateral thalamus, lingual, right fusiform and right inferior parietal cortices (rIPC). The latter association with the posterior parietal cortex was diminished after controlling for neglect. Follow up analysis showed the neglect partially mediated the correlation of CFC and rIPC. The PCA revealed three main underlying components: (1) a component associated with high-level motor control common to different measures of apraxia and linked to the left postcentral gyrus, the right thalamus and middle frontal gyrus; (2) a visuo-motor transformation component unique to the CFC and associated with lesions to the posterior occipital and sensory cortices; (3) a component associated with multistep object use tasks which was correlated with lesions to the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, the right fusiform and cerebellum. Using clinical symptoms, cognitive profiles and lesion mapping we showed that beyond visual perception, CFC performance is supported by three functional networks: one for high-level motor control, a visuo-motor transformation component, and multistep object use network...|$|R
