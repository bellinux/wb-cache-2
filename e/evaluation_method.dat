RFS 2001-01 replaced RFS I.2.c, published in 1981, however it has been criticised for continuing to require a deterministic assessment (rather than a probabilistic approach) that relies primarily on the strongest 'historically known' earthquake near a site. This leads {{to a number of}} problems including the short period (in geological timescales) for which there are records, the difficulty of assessing the characteristics of earthquakes that occurred prior to the use of seismometers, the difficulty of identifying the existence of all earthquakes that pre-date the historic record, and ultimately the reliance on one single earthquake scenario. Other criticisms include the use of intensity in the <b>evaluation</b> <b>method,</b> rather than spectral acceleration, which is commonly used elsewhere.|$|E

Several other York County school districts also participated. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new <b>evaluation</b> <b>method</b> and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, IT {{has become}} an {{important}} success factor for firms acting in national and international markets. In corporate leadership, the IT function represents a vital element supporting the business organization in achieving its goals. Doing this, IT investments have risen steadily for many years. However, not all business functions share {{the perception that the}} IT function is a key player in the firm. As demonstrated within the thesis, the overall confidence in IT and the perception of the IT value proposition is often below expectations. Business requirements seem unfulfilled. Many studies confirm these perceptions. IT functions use diverse <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> to increase and control its value. However, these <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> seem incapable of steering the IT value proposition consistently. Additionally, in light of the ongoing crisis and market dynamics, the question arises of how the IT function must be set up to support firm flexibility. It is indisputable that flexibility is an appropriate instrument for responding rapidly to market changes. Therefore, the IT function must adjust their business-relevant IT capabilities to respond to changing business demands flexibly. Thus, both flexibility measures and adequate <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> must be integrated into a comprehensive operating model that supports the management of the IT value proposition. Such a model enables the IT function to align its IT value proposition with internal and external requirements. Having understood the IT value proposition as a comprehensive set of perspectives and attributes, it is important to determine the capabilities that the IT function must fulfill to be perceived as an added value to business functions. The thesis performed a qualitative content analysis that identified IT function business requirements. These requirements were condensed into nine major capability clusters: people and organization, risk and security, infrastructure and operations, processes, projects, innovations, services, control and finance, and communication. These capability clusters represent the basis of business-required IT capabilities and a comprehensive theory of IT value. Throughout this study, the capability clusters served as essential design elements for the model developed herein. Having identified the necessary IT capabilities, it must be verified which <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> are useful to control these IT capabilities in regard to IT value creation. A catalogue of requirements was developed to identify adequate <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods.</b> An empirical survey was conducted to determine the suitability of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods.</b> The results reveal that respondents use accounting-oriented <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> the most. In contrast market-oriented <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> offer the advantage of greater future-orientation and integration of changing environments. The responses regarding multi-dimensional <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> reveal that respondents do not use the full range of <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> presented in the survey. The results regarding process-oriented <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> reveal a wide difference in usage of the two <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> presented: most respondents do not use the hedonic wage model, but the time-salary-time-saving method is more commonly used. A majority of respondents answered that they use surrogate <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods.</b> The results reveal that this category of <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> is easy to handle and can be applied to diverse situations on short notice. Having identified {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods,</b> measures were developed that increase IT function flexibility for an agile IT value proposition. Here, redundancy, modularity, reconfiguration capability and organizational learning have been identified as design principles for flexibility. These four design principles were combined with the capability clusters to derive measures that support IT function flexibility and have been evaluated by the help of an empirical survey. In response to this survey, IT managers assessed these flexibility measures and ranked their utility in each capability cluster. Having developed and assessed the <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> and flexibility measures, the study derived a comprehensive model combining <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods</b> for managing IT function capabilities and measures to increase IT function flexibility. This comprehensive model is based on the Aral and Weill model, which represents the meta-construct for the proposed model. Their model was extended by the three components developed in the present study: (1) capability clusters, (2) associated <b>evaluation</b> <b>methods,</b> and (3) ranked flexibility measures. As all firms are structured differently, the configuration of the model must be adaptable to firms¿ standards. To support such individual configuration, the model provides examples of flexibility measure configurations, further improving the model components¿ transparency.
