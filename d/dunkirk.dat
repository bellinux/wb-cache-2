5|$|The St George's Cross defaced {{with the}} arms of <b>Dunkirk</b> flown from the jack staff is the {{warranted}} house flag of the Association of <b>Dunkirk</b> Little Ships. It {{is known as the}} <b>Dunkirk</b> jack. The flag is flown only by civilian vessels that took part in the <b>Dunkirk</b> rescue operation.|$|E

5|$|Calais was {{virtually}} razed {{to the ground}} during World War II. In May 1940, it was a key objective of the invading German forces and became {{the scene of a}} last-ditch defence—the Siege of Calais—which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of <b>Dunkirk.</b> 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This may have helped Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at <b>Dunkirk,</b> as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the <b>Dunkirk</b> perimeter had it not been busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at <b>Dunkirk.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Second World War, the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 4th Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry held Cassel {{for three}} days {{as part of the}} {{defensive}} screen around <b>Dunkirk</b> during the Battle of <b>Dunkirk</b> and evacuation (27 May 1940 – 30 May 1940). The British forces had prepared a defence on the hilltop, emplacing anti-tank guns and barricading the narrow streets of the town. After scoring initial successes against the tanks of Panzer Regiment 11, which had made the mistake of advancing without infantry support, the British garrison was heavily attacked from the ground and the air by German forces. Much of the town was reduced to ruins by bombing. Most of the garrison's members were killed or captured by the Germans during the fighting or the subsequent attempted breakout towards <b>Dunkirk,</b> but the defence they had put up {{played an important role in}} holding up the Germans while the <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation was taking place.|$|E
5|$|The missing dead of the BEF are commemorated on the <b>Dunkirk</b> Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Grenade {{was then}} {{transferred}} to the English Channel and collided with the anti-submarine trawler Clayton Wyke on 14 May in heavy fog. Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During {{the initial stages of}} the evacuation from <b>Dunkirk</b> the ship provided cover {{in the northern part of}} the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to <b>Dunkirk</b> during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in <b>Dunkirk</b> harbour by German Stukas during the following day. Grenade was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler John Cattling towed Grenade over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{more than}} 100,000 French troops {{evacuated}} from <b>Dunkirk</b> were {{quickly and efficiently}} shuttled to camps {{in various parts of}} south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated. British ships ferried French troops to Brest, Cherbourg, and other ports in Normandy and Brittany, although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France. Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined Charles de Gaulle's Free French army in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The same year, in {{an unpopular}} move, Charles sold <b>Dunkirk</b> {{to his first}} cousin King Louis XIV of France for about £375,000. The channel port, {{although}} a valuable strategic outpost, was a drain on Charles's limited finances.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{joined the}} <b>Dunkirk</b> {{evacuation}} on 29 May and returned 272 men to Dover during the day. However, {{the situation at}} <b>Dunkirk</b> soon became too dangerous to risk the larger and more modern destroyers, so Harvester {{made no attempt to}} evacuate any troops during daylight hours on 30 May. This decision was rescinded during the day on 30 May and the ship sailed for <b>Dunkirk</b> on the night of 30/31 May. En route she was narrowly missed by two torpedoes, but she rescued 1341 men in two trips on 31 May and an additional 576 on 1 June. Harvester was lightly damaged by strafing German aircraft that same day and required repairs that were made at Chatham. On 9 June the ship was ordered to Le Havre, France, to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found. She loaded 78 men at Saint-Valery-en-Caux on 11 June. Later in the month she escorted ships evacuating refugees and troops from Saint-Nazaire and St. Jean de Luz (Operation Ariel).|$|E
5|$|Throughout September and October 1944, the First Canadian Army {{moved along}} the coast of France with the aim of {{securing}} the Channel Ports. On 1September, while the 3rd Division made for Boulogne and Calais, the 2nd Division entered Dieppe, encountering virtually no resistance. Five days later they were tasked by Montgomery and Crerar with retaking <b>Dunkirk.</b> Heavy fighting around the outskirts would hold the division for several days but, by 9September, the 5th Brigade had captured the port. The <b>Dunkirk</b> perimeter was handed over to the British on 15September, and the 2nd Division made for Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for the Germans, {{the bulk}} of the British Army escaped from the port of <b>Dunkirk.</b> The German Army {{eventually}} won the ensuing Battle of <b>Dunkirk,</b> forcing the Allied Armies to leave behind large amounts of equipment, but failed, through controversial circumstances, to eliminate the British manpower trapped in the pocket. The encirclement destroyed the best units of the French Army, including a prisoner of war total of 40,000, but significant forces did escape (139,732 British and 139,037 French). Some French forces would return to France and participate in the battles of June 1940, before surrendering {{along with the rest of}} the French armed forces on 25 June 1940, when the Armistice of 22 June took effect.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of <b>Dunkirk</b> between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely. However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions. The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of British troops from <b>Dunkirk</b> during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain's war production and effort was channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany. However, bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941, which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of <b>Dunkirk</b> in 1940, the British Armed Forces wanted to adopt a submachine gun similar to the MP 40. The Royal Air Force sent a request to the Ministry of Supply for 10,000 British-made copies of the MP 40, but eventually they settled on {{a copy of the}} MP 28, known as the Lanchester.|$|E
5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} Belgian {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from <b>Dunkirk,</b> rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and crews were put at the disposal of the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{experience}} led to {{him being}} promoted {{to a similar}} flotilla, this time to be deployed against <b>Dunkirk</b> {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from <b>Dunkirk,</b> and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|By 24 May, the Germans had {{captured}} {{the port of}} Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to <b>Dunkirk.</b> On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks {{and the question of}} supply to his forward troops. He was also concerned that the marshy ground around <b>Dunkirk</b> would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent). Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802), {{a string of}} {{victories}} at sea ensured that the Royal Navy was dominant. The French Navy in particular had suffered heavy losses, and in Northern European waters had been forced back into its own harbours by British blockade squadrons. Although large ports were watched by fleets of ships of the line, small ports had their own blockade squadrons too, including the shallow French ports on the English Channel. These harbours could not accommodate ships of the line but were well situated for frigates that attacked shipping in British waters whenever they could escape the blockade. One such port was <b>Dunkirk</b> in French Flanders, which contained a squadron of four French frigates: the 44-gun Poursuivante under Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, the 40-gun Carmagnole and the 36-gun Désirée and Incorruptible. <b>Dunkirk</b> was well defended, with gun batteries and gunboats overlooking the harbour. In addition, the port was surrounded by complicated coastal shoals into which the frigates could retreat if attacked.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of <b>Dunkirk</b> the Command's {{aircraft}} flew bombing missions against enemy {{ports and}} covered the evacuation effort. On 31 May 1940, Pilot Officer P. Peters and his gunner LAC Pepper of No. 500 Squadron possibly shot down Coastal Command's first air-to-air victories of the war by dispatching two Messerschmitt Bf 109s trying to intercept them. No. 220 Squadron shot down four Junkers Ju 87 Stukas on 1 June, while Hudsons of No. 206 managed to shoot down another two Bf 109s. However, air-to-air combat was rare for Coastal Command. No. 22, 812 and 815 Squadrons engaged in mining operations off Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. By {{the end of the}} <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation on 4 June 1940, Coastal Command's No. 16 Group RAF had flown 327 sorties in direct and indirect support of the Army and Navy.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Dunkirk</b> {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Guy Martin's Spitfire (2014) was a Channel 4 {{documentary}} {{covering the}} two-year restoration of a Mark 1 Spitfire, N3200, coded 'QV', {{that had been}} buried beneath the sand for 46 years after crash landing on a French beach during the <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation in 1940. Guy Martin tells the Boy's Own-style story of its pilot, Squadron Leader Geoffrey Stephenson and helps in {{the restoration of the}} aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{during the}} War of the First Coalition, Ernouf {{was sent to}} Cassel to {{strengthen}} the French position. The Duke of York laid siege to <b>Dunkirk</b> and blockaded the town of Bergues, on the Belgian border, which had insufficient garrison {{to fend off the}} British. Ernouf assembled a force of a thousand men and joined Jean Nicolas Houchard; together they marched to the relief of <b>Dunkirk.</b> Once there, he led a column in attack on the British camp. On 5 complémentaire an I (21September 1793), which would have been {{the last day of the}} first year of the new Republic, he was raised to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed on 9 vendémiaire an II (30September 1793) as chief of staff to the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Belgian government-in-exile {{decided to}} raise a {{military}} unit from pre-war Belgian émigrés and soldiers rescued from <b>Dunkirk.</b> The original forces were known as the 1st Fusilier Battalion A 2nd Fusilier Battalion was formed in Canada from Belgian émigrés in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 10 May 1940, {{the revised}} version of Unternehmen Gelb (Operation Yellow), {{also known as the}} Manstein Plan, succeeded. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Army escaped during the Battle of <b>Dunkirk.</b> Nevertheless, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were {{destroyed}} in the encirclement. This left just second rate French units to combat the entire German Army. The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase. The Luftwaffe's participation was particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the German Army to carry out Operation Yellow. By early June the <b>Dunkirk</b> siege was over, and on 3 June, the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot (Case Red). For this to be as successful, air superiority would be required first, as it had been during Operation Yellow.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, {{along with}} the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers, were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the {{battalion}} headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had been ordered to hold out {{for as long as}} possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from <b>Dunkirk.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Le Paradis {{massacre}} was a {{war crime}} committed {{by members of the}} 14th Company, SS Division Totenkopf, under the command of Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein. It took place on 27 May 1940, during the Battle of France, {{at a time when the}} British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was attempting to retreat through the Pas-de-Calais region during the Battle of <b>Dunkirk.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{broke out}} in September 1939 with the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland. British assurances to the Poles led the British Empire to declare war on Germany. As in the First World War, a relatively-small BEF was sent to France and hastily evacuated from <b>Dunkirk</b> as the German forces swept through the Low Countries and across France in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{split into two}} parts – the {{northern}} section of 742.7km from the Belfry, <b>Dunkirk</b> to Rodez Cathedral which was surveyed by Delambre and the southern section of 333.0km from Rodez to the Montjuïc Fortress, Barcelona which was surveyed by Méchain.|$|E
5|$|Their Aston Villa {{reserves}} (or seconds) team {{enlisted in}} the army and were captured at the <b>Dunkirk</b> evacuation in June 1940. In December in an Eastern German camp, a German Guard regiment challenged British prisoners of war to a game of football; the guards were being defeated 27-0 when they stopped the game, only then learning these prisoners were Aston Villa's second team.|$|E
5|$|Voeckler {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{prolific}} winners of the early season, tallying eight victories in 2011, the last of them obtained on May 8. The veteran Frenchman won five stages at four stage races, plus the overall crowns at the Tour du Haut Var and the Four Days of <b>Dunkirk</b> along with the single-day Cholet-Pays de Loire.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice of Mudros {{was signed}} on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship {{participated in the}} early stage of the {{occupation}} of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December. Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922–25 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937; sold to M. Gosselin-Duriez on 30 July 1937 for 3,557,010 FF, she arrived at <b>Dunkirk</b> for breaking up on 31 August.|$|E
5|$|After the {{beginning}} of the Battle of France on 10 May, the 2nd DCT was transferred to the English Channel to support British forces there. On 23 May, entering <b>Dunkirk</b> harbor with a demolition team aboard, Jaguar was struck by a torpedo fired by either the E-boat S-21 or S-23. The detonation killed 13 men and wounded 23; the ship had to be beached at Malo-les-Bains lest she sink, and was written off.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was nearly perfect for the attack. The British armada had collected at <b>Dunkirk</b> in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to <b>Dunkirk,</b> unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite of the fog, air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised formation flying on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from <b>Dunkirk</b> were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E
5|$|For {{every seven}} {{soldiers}} who escaped through <b>Dunkirk,</b> {{one man was}} left behind as a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water {{that had been left}} at the roadside by French civilians for the marching prisoners to drink.|$|E
5|$|Goble was {{accepted}} for flying training with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in July 1915. After graduating as a flight sub-lieutenant on 20 October 1915, {{he became a}} test pilot and undertook anti-submarine patrols out of Dover. Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience. Towards {{the end of the}} year he was posted across the Channel to <b>Dunkirk,</b> flying Caudron reconnaissance-bombers and Sopwith Pup fighters.|$|E
