5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 <b>hours</b> of diving.

The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
