5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement in the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft,</b> which Conley {{said he had}} left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was {{an indication that the}} elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence of}} a burglary.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft)</b> along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|Because Roger {{unfortunately}} {{appears at}} every {{scene of crime}} just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft)</b> are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E
5|$|The Expo MRT Station, {{located on}} the Changi Airport Branch Line (CAL) of the East West Line, is {{adjacent}} to the 100,000-square-metre Singapore Expo exhibition facility. Designed by Foster and Partners and completed in January 2001, the station features a large, pillarless, titanium-clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes {{the length of the}} station platform. This complements a smaller 40-metre reflective stainless-steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> and the main entrance. The other station with similar architecture is Dover.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} suffered substantial damage {{during the}} 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor twisted in a corkscrew fashion. On {{the top three}} floors, 80percent of the perimeter walls were damaged. A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor. An <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> and five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured. There were no injuries but {{it was estimated that}} the repairs would cost $6million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
50|$|High-rise {{buildings}} sometimes also incorporate fans {{to produce}} a positive pressure in stairwells and <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> to reduce smoke infiltration into those spaces.|$|R

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|One World Trade Center's steel {{structure}} topped {{out at the}} nominal 104th floor, with a total height of , in August 2012. The tower's antenna was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and {{the first section of}} the antenna was hoisted {{to the top of the}} tower on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its full height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E
5|$|Upon her joining, {{however, the}} members of the group are {{targeted}} and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft,</b> trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.|$|E
25|$|The California version {{also had}} a {{slightly}} different queue area. The boiler room scene in the queue area had two floors, instead of the one floor in the original Florida version. The two floors allowed for one <b>elevator</b> in one <b>shaft</b> to have guests on ride, while the other elevator of the same shaft was loading guests. There were three <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> in the Disney California Adventure version, with two <b>elevators</b> per <b>shaft,</b> {{for a total of}} six elevators operating at once.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic {{features}} of the Walter Gropius house are its concave structure, textured facade and distinctive narrow sides. The apartments are accessed via four separate doorways, tower-like stairwells and <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} struck by {{lightning}} on August 31, 2003, which caused a firepump {{to turn on the}} sprinkler system. This caused flooding and extensive damage to the <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5|$|The next day, Archie follows {{through on}} Regina's warning by convincing Henry that {{the fairy tale}} stories are not real, {{upsetting}} Henry. This prompts Emma to {{pay a visit to}} Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft,</b> not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the {{president}} of the RUF/NEKS along with {{the president}} of the RUF/NEK Lil Sis (the sister cooperative to the RUF/NEKS) climbed into the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> of one of the buildings on campus and painted a giant RUF/NEK paddle along the four-story <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> along with a note to future pledges. After it was discovered, the shaft was closed but the painting still remains.|$|E
25|$|Two of Dodger Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features are the wavy roof atop each outfield pavilion {{and the top}} of a 10-story <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> bearing the Dodger logo rising directly behind home plate {{at the top of the}} uppermost seating level.|$|E
5000|$|The {{passenger}} cabs are mechanically {{separated from}} the lift mechanism, thus allowing the <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors. The passenger cabs, which are automated guided vehicles or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few [...] "floors" [...] of the attraction {{are open to the}} outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out {{from the top of the}} structure.|$|R
50|$|Common {{exclusions}} to {{the total}} calculation of square footage {{for the purpose of}} floor area ratio (FAR) include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, stair towers, <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts,</b> and parking garages.|$|R
5000|$|While {{buildings}} with deep subbasements could connect {{directly to the}} tunnel, connections to surface level and shallow basements were by <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] George W. Jackson, the contractor who built the tunnel system, received several patents related to building such shafts.|$|R
25|$|The building's {{original}} <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> {{was determined}} to be too small for a modern elevator, so a new shaft was built onto the back of the building along with a new stairwell. As part of the restoration requirements, the exterior of the shaft had to be a different color than the building to easily distinguish it from the original structure. Its placement on the building's southwest corner was done under guidelines from the National Park Service. The original <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> was used as a conduit for electrical wiring and plumbing. Additionally, one of the original entrance doors facing East Main Street had to be restored but unusable due to a ramp for the building to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, DART's Cityplace Station, {{after years}} of planning, opened beneath North Central Expressway with entrances {{on both sides of}} the highway, the east side being in the bottom of the tower, the west in an {{aluminum}} and glass hut above the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft</b> to the station's upper level under the expressway.|$|E
25|$|Several {{actors who}} {{appeared}} in small roles, including John Crawford, Erik Nelson, Elizabeth Rogers, Ernie Orsatti, and Sheila Matthews, had previously appeared in The Poseidon Adventure, which Irwin Allen also produced. (Allen and Matthews were husband and wife.) Paul Newman's son Scott played the acrophobic fireman afraid to rappel down the <b>elevator</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{house on}} W. 10th Avenue {{suffered}} peripheral damage, {{but only one}} block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> sticking {{up out of the}} rubble like a seesaw.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invention}} of the elevator was a precondition for the {{invention of}} skyscrapers, given {{that most people would}} not (or could not) climb more than a few flights of stairs at a time. [...] The elevators in a skyscraper are not simply a necessary utility, like running water and electricity, but are in fact closely related to the design of the whole structure: a taller building requires more elevators to service the additional floors, but the <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> consume valuable floor space. [...] If the service core, which contains the <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts,</b> becomes too big, it can reduce the profitability of the building. [...] Architects must therefore balance the value gained by adding height against the value lost to the expanding service core.|$|R
50|$|A sky {{lobby is}} an {{intermediate}} interchange floor {{where people can}} change from an express elevator that stops only at the sky lobby to a local elevator which stops at every floor within {{a segment of the}} building. When designing very tall (supertall) buildings, supplying enough elevators is a problem - travellers wanting to reach a specific higher floor may conceivably have to stop at {{a very large number of}} other floors on the way up to let other passengers off and on. This increases travel time, and indirectly requires many more <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> to still allow acceptable travel times - thus reducing effective floor space on each floor for all levels. The other main technique to increase usage without adding more <b>elevator</b> <b>shafts</b> is double-deck <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
