5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E
5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E

In 1811 Lisa was host to the first recorded tourist to present-day South Dakota: Pittsburgh lawyer Henry Marie Brackenridge.|$|E

500|$|Washington's {{difficulty}} in discerning Howe's motives {{was due to}} the presence of a British army moving south from Quebec toward Fort Ticonderoga under the command of General John Burgoyne. [...] Howe's departure was in part prompted by the successful capture of the fort by Burgoyne in early July. [...] Although there had been an expectation on Burgoyne's part that Howe would support his campaign to gain control of the Hudson, Howe was to disappoint Burgoyne, with disastrous consequences to the British. [...] When Washington learned of the abandonment of Ticonderoga (which he had been told by General Anthony Wayne [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood"), he was shocked. [...] Concerned that Howe was <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Hudson, he ordered Arnold, along with Daniel Morgan and his corps of riflemen, north to assist General Gates with the defense of the Hudson.|$|E
500|$|The New Englanders {{departed}} Annapolis Royal on 10/21 June in a whaleboat and two flatboats, <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Annapolis River. [...] Because {{they were}} delayed by the tide, {{word of the}} force's departure preceded them, giving the Natives time {{to set up an}} ambush near the mouth of what later became known as Bloody Creek. [...] The whaleboat was faster on the water, and was about a mile (1.6km) ahead of the flatboats when it reached the ambush site. [...] The surprise was complete: {{all but one of the}} whaleboat's men were killed. [...] Hearing the gunfire, the flatboats hurried to catch up, and carelessly made directly for the whaleboat. [...] This exposed them to fire from Natives on the shore, and they suffered further significant casualties before they were surrounded and the survivors surrendered. [...] Sixteen were killed, nine wounded, and the rest were captured.|$|E
500|$|The parkway {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Routes 9 and 9N (Canada Street) {{in the town}} of Lake George. The parkway passes through a gate, <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> base of Prospect Mountain. The route is very scenic, with trees {{on both sides of the}} road. Route917A parallels Birch Ave., a street in Lake George. Soon after, the parkway passes over Interstate87 (I-87, named the Adirondack Northway). The road expands to several lanes after the Northway, coming to a tollbooth. After the toll booth, the parkway begins to head up the mountain. With large heavy, stabilized rocks on both sides of the road, used as a guard rail to prevent danger(such as running off of the road), the parkway curves around the mountain, intersecting with several specialized scenic overlooks. The road curves around the several peaks of Prospect Mountain, coming to an end at the main peak at , where a [...] view can be seen.

When asked about where he found the gun, Sawyer says he took it from a dead U.S. Marshal. Sayid accuses Sawyer of being the marshal's prisoner. Kate takes the gun from Sawyer and Sayid instructs her on how to dismantle it.|$|E
500|$|McLachlan was {{appointed}} Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959, before being posted to Washington, DC, as attaché <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961. During his {{term in the}} US, Australia ordered the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber {{as a replacement for}} the Canberra. Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order, McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F-111, and what the final cost would be. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, [...] "even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan, that was to prove a painfully prescient observation", as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget. Following his return from Washington, McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964. As AMSE he sat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers, chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated supply officers, following similar achievements among engineering officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch. He {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year's Honours, the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two [...] "historic" [...] committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force's command structure in the late 1950s. The use of electronic data processing became more widespread during McLachlan's tenure as AMSE, and by 1968 the RAAF's supply system had been computerised.|$|E
500|$|Patchway {{railway station}} first opened on 8 September 1863 when {{services}} {{began on the}} Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (BSWUR), which ran from [...] to , north of Bristol {{on the banks of}} the River Severn. At New Passage, passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on into Wales. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as single track [...] broad gauge. Patchway was [...] from Temple Meads, adjacent to the Bristol to Gloucester road, what is now the A38 Gloucester Road. The station was only a small structure, and very little is known about it. There were initially six trains per day on weekdays in each direction, with three trains per day on Sundays. The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR), which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services, in 1868; and in 1873 the line was converted to [...] standard gauge. Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier, the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient, and so a tunnel was built under the Severn. To cope with the anticipated increase in demand, it was decided that the line should be increased to twin track. However, the gradient between [...] and Patchway, 1 in 68, was considered undesirably steep for trains <b>heading</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill towards Bristol, particularly for heavy coal trains, and so a three-mile deviation was built with a 1 in 100 gradient between Pilning and a point south of Patchway. Trains uphill towards Bristol would use the new line, while trains downhill towards Wales would continue to use the steeper, original track. The deviation left the two tracks at Patchway at significantly different levels, and so made the original site impractical for a station. The station was rebuilt [...] south along the line at its present site, [...] from Bristol Temple Meads. A boulder and information board marks the site of the original station.|$|E
