50|$|A little cigar is a cigar that is {{the same}} size as a cigarette—often {{featuring}} a filter—however, it still retains its identity as a cigar because it is wrapped in a tobacco leaf, or more often a paper wrapper made of tobacco pulp, reconstituted tobacco or <b>homogenized</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Flavored little cigars are available on the market as well. Flavored little cigars have been steadily increasing in popularity among cigar smokers. Manufacturers like Prime Time have been offering flavored little cigars since 1993.|$|E
50|$|Black & Milds have a wrapper (and {{possibly}} filler) made of <b>homogenized</b> pipe <b>tobacco,</b> and {{are sold}} {{with a plastic}} or wood tip, untipped, in a shorter version called Shorts—which are {{about half of the}} size of regular Black & Milds—and also in filtered little cigar versions.|$|R
5000|$|Blunts are wide, {{somewhat}} stubby {{versions of}} cigars. Most, if not all, are machine-made [...] "domestic cigars" [...] created from <b>homogenized</b> or reconstituted <b>tobacco.</b> They are usually inexpensive, and only lightly fermented.|$|R
