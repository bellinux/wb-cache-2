40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{advertisements}} have objectified and sexualized women as a tactic to attract men into supporting causes and buying products. This research project focuses on the advertisements published by the animal rights group, PETA, People <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatments</b> of Animals, and its deliberate use of degrading images of women to support its cause. PETA advertisements juxtapose barely clad women with animals or animal references, making the viewer see women as animalistic, out of control, {{and in need of}} taming or saving. Research shows that the results of such negative advertising tactics are correlated with increased aggression in male viewers, as well as increased acceptance of rape attitudes among men. Sexualized and objectified images take away from the purpose of the animal rights movement, making the audience reluctant to support the cause. Furthermore, these advertisements seriously jeopardize and undermine the women 2 ̆ 7 s fight for equality in our culture. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|A diverse {{range of}} groups have raised issues, such as People <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatment</b> of Animals (PETA), over the welfare of animals, {{governmental}} and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws, and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws. These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E
40|$|To copy {{or not to}} copy, {{to exploit}} the famous celebrity image or not to exploit it; these are the questions. The message of the modern legal world communicated through {{multiple}} voices in the academy is that copying often is perfectly acceptable and even laudable. An artist or designer might conclude that it is both legal and ethical to use whatever you can, use whatever {{you can get away}} with, and use it until you get sued for using it. Yet plagiarism in the arts and sciences is nearly universally condemned. This Article proposes an <b>ethical</b> approach to <b>the</b> use of copyrighted works and names, images, and likenesses protected by the right of publicity. This approach is based on <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> requirements of <b>the</b> law as synthesized from the cases presenting concrete narratives concerning fair and appropriate uses of protected works, names, and images. My thesis may be summed up in a revised form of the KISS principle (Keep it simple, stupid!) known as "DIOS MIO: Don’t Include Other’s Stuff or Modify It Obviously". Although simplified to this acronym, <b>the</b> <b>ethical</b> considerations concerning copyright-protected works and right of publicity-protected names and images are far from simple. The advice of this Article reflects the convergence of predominant purpose analysis and transformative/transformation analysis in copyright and right of publicity law that has led to a single set of recommendations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> legal and <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> of protected works and celebrity names, images, and likenesses: seek first to create and not to copy or exploit, and create new expression by obvious modification of the old expression and content...|$|R
