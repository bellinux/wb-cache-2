[...] Madonna's first single from American Life—the title track—became the lowest charting first single from a Madonna album since her debut, reaching a peak of number37 on the Billboard Hot 100. Warner Bros. Records hastily wanted to save the album from dropping off the charts, and decided to release [...] "Hollywood", believing the song to have commercial success potential.|$|E
500|$|In interviews, Hendrix usually gave {{different}} {{answers about}} the development of the song's lyrics. [...] Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. [...] As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. [...] Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. [...] In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. [...] An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze – Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. [...] In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a <b>dream</b> <b>I</b> had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the lyrics}} to [...] "Purple Haze", which opened the US edition of Are You Experienced, are often misinterpreted as {{describing}} an acid trip, Hendrix explained: [...] " [...] was all about a <b>dream</b> <b>I</b> had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He speculated that the dream may {{have been inspired by}} a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken LSD {{at the time of the}} song's writing, which was after a gig in London on December 26, 1966. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a tritone that was known as the diabolus in musica during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of religious music from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: [...] "to play it was like ringing Satan's doorbell." [...] In the opinion of the author Ritchie Unterberger, the opening riff has [...] "become a permanent part of rock's vocabulary." [...] Whereas Rolling Stone described the song as the beginning of late-60s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix's use of R, funk, and soul elements in the track.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra did {{not serve}} in the {{military}} during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum. However, army files reported that Sinatra was [...] "not acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint", but his emotional instability was hidden to avoid [...] "undue unpleasantness for both the selectee and the induction service". Briefly, there were rumors reported by columnist Walter Winchell that Sinatra paid $40,000 to avoid the service, but the FBI found this to be without merit. Toward the end of the war, Sinatra entertained the troops during several successful overseas USO tours with comedian Phil Silvers. During one trip to Rome he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor. [...] Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In 1944 Sinatra released [...] "I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night" [...] as a single and recorded his own version of Crosby's [...] "White Christmas", and the following year he released [...] "I Dream of You (More Than You <b>Dream</b> <b>I</b> Do)", [...] "Saturday Night (Is the Loneliest Night of the Week)", [...] "Dream" [...] and [...] "Nancy (with the Laughing Face)" [...] as singles.|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Lovato {{started to}} work and {{recorded}} on her second album, right after filming from the first season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato explained about the album's process and collaborating with songwriters from the album including Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly finished in just two weeks, noting that she [...] "basically went from full time acting mode to full time album mode". As she wanted to accomplish more [...] "John Mayer-ish type of songs", she contacted Mayer's management in order to collaborate him, citing {{him as one of}} her biggest musical influences. Mayer accepted the offer, of which Lovato said, [...] "I was completely shocked [...] It was more of a pipe <b>dream.</b> <b>I</b> didn't ever {{think it would be a}} reality, but it came true. He was taking a chance on working with a younger artist in the pop realm." [...] The two wrote three songs together, [...] "World of Chances", [...] "Love is the Answer" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Love Me". Lovato said that it was intimidating to work with him as she was worried that he would not like her lyrics, and she would get [...] "super excited" [...] whenever he complimented her. [...] "World of Chances", the first song she wrote with Mayer, was the only of these songs to make the album's final cut. The song was inspired by Lovato's first experience of love and heartbreak.|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home.

[...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E

Living {{in a family of}} actors inspired her to pursue acting from a young age. She and her sisters participated in amateur stage shows at school and at a local youth theatre, named Foundations. At age five, Winslet made her first stage appearance as Mary in her school's production of the Nativity. She has described herself as [...] "quite stocky as a child"; she was nicknamed [...] "blubber" [...] by her schoolmates and was bullied for they way she looked. She said of the experience, [...] "I didn't lock myself away and give up on my <b>dream.</b> <b>I</b> fought back." [...] At age 11, Winslet was accepted into the Redroofs Theatre School in Maidenhead. The school also functioned as an agency and took students to London to audition for acting jobs. She appeared in a Sugar Puffs commercial and dubbed for foreign films. At school, she was made head girl and took part in productions of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and played the lead role of Wendy Darling in Peter Pan. She worked simultaneously with the Starmaker Theatre Company in Reading. She participated in over 20 of their stage productions, but has said that she was rarely selected as the lead due to her weight. Nonetheless, she played key roles as Miss Agatha Hannigan in Annie, the Mother Wolf in The Jungle Book, and Lena Marelli in Bugsy Malone.|$|E

[...] Bill Lamb of the website About.com, put the song in his list of Top Tracks from The Open Door along with [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", [...] "Call Me When You're Sober", [...] "Your Star" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa". Jon Dolan from Entertainment Weekly said that [...] " [...] the deceptively soft 'Good Enough' flirts again with the dark side, offering 'Drink up sweet decadence / I can't say no to you' and striking a final note of cathartic badness." [...] Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Lee's [...] "newfound confidence" [...] is evident in the song. In his review of The Open Door, Andree Farias of Christianity Today concluded that though the song [...] "leaves a sweet taste in your mouth", it may not mean much in [...] "a scheme."
