5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese <b>grinders.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, <b>grinders</b> and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Researchers {{are still}} trying to find {{effective}} ways to test web application. There are many techniques and tools for web application testing. In this dissertation, we have enhanced <b>grinder</b> performance tool with scheduling and improved Agents. The <b>Grinder</b> makes use of a powerful distributed Java load testing framework that allows simulation of multiple user loads across different “agents ” which can be managed by a centralized controller or “console”. A <b>grinder</b> agent/worker processes exits once <b>Grinder</b> Console process ends session. We have added scheduler which works as a service on <b>Grinder</b> agent systems. This add-on will help users to start <b>grinder</b> from console itself. <b>Grinder</b> does not provide the way for distributing the agents so they must be deployed and started manually in all machines. There is no way that these agents keep running at back end. In enhanced <b>grinder</b> load increases in steps as done in J meter. Previous <b>Grinder</b> does not allow addition of heterogeneous agents to a <b>grinder</b> test, we will be removing this limitation by making <b>Grinder</b> agents use specified configuration in agents’ properties while seeming to <b>grinder</b> Console. Enhanced <b>grinder</b> allows heterogeneous workers capability...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} business importing American {{machine tools}} into Britain began with Charles Churchill as sole proprietor {{and later as}} a partnership with two others. It became a limited company in 1889. In 1906 a separate company, The Churchill Machine Tool Co Ltd, was established {{with the purpose of}} adapting tools imported by Charles Churchill & Co. The former expanded, producing American tools under licence and then manufactured tools of its own design, in particular precision surface <b>grinders</b> and similar engineering machinery. In 1918 The Churchill Machine Tool Co relocated its factories onto a single site at Broadheath, near Altrincham.|$|E

25|$|In {{the past}} <b>grinders</b> {{were used for}} {{finishing}} operations only because of limitations of tooling.

25|$|Because of work-exposure to silica dust, {{silicosis}} is {{an occupational}} hazard to mining, sandblasting, quarry, ceramics and foundry workers, {{as well as}} <b>grinders,</b> stone cutters, refractory brick workers, tombstone workers, pottery workers, fiberglass manufacturing, flint knappers and others.

25|$|The nanocellulose fibrils may be {{isolated}} from the wood-based fibers using mechanical methods which expose the pulp to high shear forces, ripping the larger wood-fibres apart into nanofibers. For this purpose, high-pressure homogenizers, ultrasonic homogenizers, <b>grinders</b> or microfluidizers can be used. The homogenizers are used to delaminate the cell walls of the fibers and liberate the nanosized fibrils. This process consumes very large amounts of energy and values over 30 MWh/tonne are not uncommon.|$|E
