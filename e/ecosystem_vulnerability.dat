40|$|Marine social-ecological {{systems are}} complex, inter-connected, and highly dynamic, in {{particular}} when forced with global changes. However, their human social components are often treated separately from their biophysical components, and by different scientific disciplines. To help bridge these gaps, {{and to explore}} conceptual, comparative, and governance issues relating to marine social-ecological systems and global change, an international symposium was held on "Coping with global change in marine social-ecological systems". This short paper provides an introduction to this topic, and briefly describes nine papers which arose from this symposium and which comprise this special issue of Marine Policy. It is concluded that good {{progress is being made}} towards studying marine social and ecological systems as coupled systems, but that many issues remain to challenge natural scientists, social scientists, and humanists to work together.

40|$|Abstract: Vulnerability is {{the degree}} to which human and {{environmental}} systems are likely to experience harm due to a perturbation or a stress. In the last years, it has become a central focus of the global change (including climate change). The climate change literature contains many explanations of vulnerability, stemming from the notion of sensitivity to more complex ideas, yet taking into account the exposure history of the system up to residual impacts of climate change after adaptation. This work addresses the issue of <b>ecosystems</b> <b>vulnerability</b> assessment by presenting a conceptual framework, as an attempt to generalize previous approaches. We present a model of concepts linked to climate change vulnerability, based on literature review, in which we detail the key concepts of adaptation and mitigation measures (and their respective capacity), ecosystem stability (sensitivity, ecological resilience and elasticity), exposure and impacts. An exemplary case-study is given to address the issue of vulnerability assessment for grassland ecosystems with the help of an impact model (ModVege).

Visual interpretation of satellites imagery (1972, 1986, and 2001), field works, technical and survey data were used to provide quantitative analysis of Land Use/Cover change information and its greatest drivers in the study area. The changes become more and more important under simultaneous influence of successive droughts (1973 - 1974 and 1983 - 1984) that have disrupted ecological balance, anthropogenic and animal impacts, ecosystems degradation and politico-institutional policies.

It can be shown that the integrated hydrological system approach (TVGM), with distributed physical process or conceptual units, could obtain a flexible result for hydrological modelling given the scarcity of fully physical process data. By preliminary application and examination in the Heihe mountainous basin of northwest China with an area of about 10 000 km(2) in arid and semiarid regions, it was found that this model is successful, with more advantages than the conditional distributed model applied in China.

Understanding how these stressors interact to affect ecosystem {{structure and function}} has immediate implications for coastal planning, however few studies quantify stressor interactions. We examined past and potential future interactions between two leading stressors on New England salt marshes: sea-level rise and marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum) grazing driven low marsh die-off. Geospatial analyses reveal that crab-driven die-off {{has led to an}} order of magnitude more marsh loss than sea-level rise between 2005 and 2013. However, field transplant experimental results suggest that sea-level rise will facilitate crab expansion into higher elevation marsh platforms by inundating and gradually softening now-tough high marsh peat, exposing large areas to crab-driven die-off. Taking interactive effects of marsh softening and concomitant overgrazing into account, we estimate that even modest levels of sea-level rise will lead to levels of salt marsh habitat loss that are 3 x greater than the additive effects of sea-level rise and crab-driven die-off would predict.

Climate change is expected to lead to increased drought risks to net primary productivity in the Mediterranean area: five of the models estimate that risk will exceed 20 15 %.

The frequency of distribution demonstrated that herbaceous species occurrences were more influenced by the mixed effect of climate and land use than their separate effects. Occasional and rare species are {{the most important part of}} herbaceous vegetation. Thus heterogeneity of Savanna <b>ecosystem</b> and <b>vulnerability</b> of herbaceous species are high...|$|R
30|$|To analyse {{impacts of}} the {{different}} district-scale scenarios, social and environmental indicators were chosen based on the assessment of <b>ecosystems</b> and human <b>vulnerabilities</b> {{in the study area}} and generally used in scenario evaluations (Alcamo and Henrichs 2008, Jaeger et al. 2007, National Environmental Management Authority, 2008). Scenarios were then classified based on their performance according to the single indicator, using ‘traffic light’ options: red represented a bad performance, green a good one and orange a medium one. Once scenarios were ranked, a quantitative evaluation of the most critical indicators was undertaken: the impacts on land demand for farming purposes and firewood and charcoal demand (Knöpfle, 2004) showed, for each scenario, whether the natural resources of the area were sufficient to support the population’s needs.|$|R
