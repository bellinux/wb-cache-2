40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 - 212 This {{paper will}} review the best {{practices}} for installation of a centrifugal air compressor without a sound enclosure to obtain the best acoustic environment for reduced operating noise levels. An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and installation of accessory hardware associated with the compressor installation will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and valves for noise reduction, drain line noise attenuation, <b>inlet</b> <b>silencer</b> selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction. In any case, when the compressor is in operation, the noise level measured with a sound level meter is often higher than the actual compressor generated noise. This paper will provide guidelines on how to achieve compressor installation noise objectives...|$|E

The sound power level L_W_A in dB to be determined {{within the scope of}} the EU-Type Examination for the conveyor of soil proper and the sound pressure level L_n_A are regulated by the EU-Directives 86 / 662 /EEC and 89 / 514 /EEC. The present limit values for the sound power level L_W_A= 106 dB to 113 dB dependend on the performance are the basic precondition for the participation in the free movement of goods within the EU-States. These limit values do not always meet the present state of the sound insulation technology. The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) has extended to awarding catalogue for the eco-label 'Blauer Engel RAL-UZ 53 '' for low-noise building machines and devices by the category of the excavators of high capacity (P_N> 85 kW). The present report shows that it is possible from the economic and technical aspect to introduce on the market of the EU states tracked excavators of the 40 tons category with a sound power level L_W_A= 101 dB and with a sound pressure level L_p_A= 71 dB at the operator's place at the dynamic working cycle according to the EU-Direktive 89 / 514 /EEC. In this connection sound insulation measures were carried out at the source of relatively low-noise driving motors and passive sound insulation measures (exhaust emission air <b>inlet</b> <b>silencers,</b> optimized silencers, full encasing/partial encasing).

50|$|Carlo Abarth was {{sporting}} {{director of}} the Cisitalia factory racing team starting in 1947.1948 saw the financial downfall of Cisitalia, spurred by the investments needed to put the 202 coupé into production. The following year the manufacturer folded, and founder Piero Dusio flew to Argentina.Carlo Abarth, funded by Armando Scagliarini, took over Cisitalia's assets and on 31 March 1949 Abarth & C. was founded in Bologna. Carlo's astrological sign, Scorpio, {{was chosen as the}} company logo.From the Cisitalia liquidation Abarth obtained five 204 sports cars (two complete Spiders and three unfinished), a D46 single seater and various spares. The 204s were immediately rechristened Abarth 204 A.Abarth built and raced sports cars developed from the last Cisitalia cars. In addition to Guido Scagliarini, the «Squadra Abarth» racing team lined up celebrated drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari, Franco Cortese and Piero Taruffi. Notably Tazio Nuvolari made his last appearance in racing at the wheel of an Abarth 204 A, winning its class in the Palermo-Monte Pellegrino hillclimb on 10 April 1950. Alongside racing, the company's main activity was producing and selling accessories and performance parts for Fiat, Lancia, Cisitalia and Simca cars, like <b>inlet</b> manifolds and <b>silencers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Within this {{research}} project a low-noise air-blower was developed, which under maximum power produces a volume-flow of 730 m" 3 /h and a {{sound power level}} of 97 dB(A). Near the operator's ear, a sound power level of 85 dB(A) is not exceeded. Therefore, compared to ordinary blowers with the same volume-flow, this low-noise blower shows a reduced noise-emission of more than 10 dB(A). This noise-reducement was possible through technical advancement of some components. The rotational speed was lowered by more than 1000 min"-" 1 without reducing the produced volume - flow. The below listed measures were proceeded: increase of motor-power through tuned intake pressure charging, development of <b>inlet</b> and muffler <b>silencer</b> as Helmholtz resonator, avoidance of sharp edges in the ventilator's inside, enlargement of tongue radius, increase of relation of obstacles in the flow to casing. The accomplished measures can be taken over the production without any kind of restriction. The measures at the driving elements can also be applied to other motor powered gradening equipment. Increased costs arise only at the muffler silencer. (orig.)
