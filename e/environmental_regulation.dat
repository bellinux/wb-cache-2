As a result, this study adopted detailed case studies to overcome the problems of previous empirical studies due to their aggregate nature and to understand well {{the nature of the relationship}} between <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> and innovation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Many economists {{believe that}} the {{slowdown}} of the productivity growth rates in the U. S. economy in early 1970 's was {{a consequence of the}} increased level of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations.</b> The main reason presented in support of this argument is that increased <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> impose an additional burden to the firms, thus increasing the costs of the production of conventional outputs and decreasing productivity growth rates. The opposing view, called Porter hypothesis, claims that <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> may {{have a positive effect on}} the performance of domestic firms relative to their foreign competitors by stimulating domestic innovation. Given that the environmental standards are lower in Mexico than in the U. S. we expect to find relatively smaller effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> in Mexico. During the debates of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 1994, this difference in <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> levels of the two countries was hypothesized to encourage the migration of U. S. dirty industries to Mexico, thus putting Mexican economy into disadvantage. There are many studies of the effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> on U. S. manufacturing performance, however there is little empirical work showing the effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> on productivity of Mexico and comparing the relative performance of industries of the two countries. In this study we compare the relative performance of U. S. and Mexican primary iron & steel and aluminum industries, RAMA 3411 and RAMA 3423 correspondingly (according to Mexican Economic Census 1975 industrial classification). We estimate primal and dual TFP growth rates based on translog restricted cost function using fixed-effects approach. We found positive effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> on dual TFP growth in all industries. The results support Porter's "win-win" hypothesis...|$|R

The empirical answer suggests that harmonizing product regulations leads to more trade; domestic <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> have a larger negative effect on trade when they are treated as endogenous; and EU countries relax domestic <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> due to the harmonization of regulations, whereas the Central and Eastern European countries that joined or will join the European Union set more stringent <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations.</b> enlargement, <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations,</b> European integration, gravity model,...|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to verify the {{pollution}} haven hypothesis, this study investigates the impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> on foreign direct investment (FDI). We use Korean outward FDI data covering the manufacturing sector for 2009 - 15. The study not only considers the stringency but also the enforcement of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> when measuring the degree of the host country 2 ̆ 019 s <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations.</b> Since the pollution haven 2 ̆ 019 s effects indicate moving the polluting production stages from the home country to other (host) countries, we distinguish between investments in the 2 ̆ 018 production 2 ̆ 019 part from that in the non-production part using location information about the host country. The main results of the estimation of a FDI model show that the stricter the regulations in host countries in Asia the lower the FDI both intensively and extensively to those countries. This supports the prevalence {{of the effects of}} pollution havens. However, before we separate the FDI into the production part, the effect of <b>environmental</b> <b>regulations</b> on FDI is hindered by the FDI in the non-production part.
