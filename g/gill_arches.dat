5|$|The {{spinner shark}} is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated {{by age and}} sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the spinner shark include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests the mouth and <b>gill</b> <b>arches,</b> and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear margins of the fins.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E

Unlike the North American fossils, its habitat was almost certainly fresh water.|$|E

50|$|The {{indirect}} route of this nerve {{is the result}} of evolution of mammals from fish, which had no neck and had a relatively short nerve that innervated one gill slit and passed near the <b>gill</b> <b>arch.</b> Since then, the gill it innervated has become the larynx and the <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> has become the dorsal aorta in mammals.|$|R

25|$|The {{head was}} {{probably}} relatively large and wide but still elongated. The snout is completely unknown. Frontal bones are absent. The skull roof is rather robust with bosses on the parietals, continuing sideways over the dermopterotica, and the postparietals. The parietals have a notch {{on the front}} midline. A dermosphenoticum is present above the eye socket. The jaws are toothless. Behind the jaw joint a robust hyomandibula is present. The gill basket rests on paired hypohyalia. At least the first two <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> have ossified hypobranchialia, the lower parts of the gill arch; a third hypobranchiale was likely present. The hypobranchials are attached at their lower ends at an angle of 21,5° via a functional joint that possibly served to increase the gape of the mouth, to about two feet. All five <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> have ossified ceratobranchialia with a triangular cross-section, the middle sections of the arches. The hypobranchials are fused with their ceratobranchials. The fifth gill arch is fused with the front parts of the basket. Higher epibranchialia and pharyngobranchialia are present but poorly known. The fourth arches are supported by a midline fourth basibranchiale. An ossified operculum is present.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} is the ear {{ossicles}} of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological studies originated in {{the upper and lower}} jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> of early fish. We owe this esoteric knowledge to the comparative anatomists, who, a century ago, were {{at the cutting edge of}} evolutionary studies. The word exaptation was coined to cover these shifts in function, which are surprisingly common in evolutionary history. The origin of wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation is a more recent discovery (see feathered dinosaurs).|$|E
25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E
30|$|P. micronesicus sp. nov. can be {{distinguished}} from its sibling species, P. coelestis, in typically having 15 rays on the anal fin (vs. 14 rays in P. coelestis, Figure  2 C), 15 or 16 rakers on the lower limb of the first <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> (vs. 13 or 14 rakers), more total gill rakers on the first <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> (20 to 23 vs. 18 to 21), and a lower body depth (Table  1). Moreover, the caudal fin usually possesses a filamentous upper lobe that is deeply concave in P. micronesicus sp. nov., {{but that was not}} frequently observed in P. coelestis. On the other hand, P. auriventris has II, 14 anal fin rays, 13 gill rakers on the lower limb, and 18 or 19 total gill rakers on the first <b>gill</b> <b>arch.</b> P. alleni has II, 14 anal fin rays, 12 or 13 gill rakers in the upper limb, and 17 or 18 total gill rakers in the first <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> (Table  2).|$|R

25|$|Leedsichthys fossils {{have been}} {{difficult}} to interpret because the skeletons were not completely made of bone. Large parts consisted of cartilage that did not fossilize. On several occasions the enigmatic large partial remains have been mistaken for stegosaurian dinosaur bones. As the vertebrae are among the parts that have not been preserved, it is hard to determine the total body length. Estimates have varied wildly. At {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century a length of nine metres (thirty feet) was seen as plausible, but by its end Leedsichthys was sometimes claimed to have been over thirty metres (hundred feet) long. Recent research has lowered this to about sixteen metres (fifty feet) for the largest individuals. Skull bones have been found indicating that Leedsichthys had a large head with bosses on the skull roof. Fossilised bony fin rays show large elongated pectoral fins and a tall vertical tail fin. The <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> were lined by gill rakers, equipped by a unique system of delicate bone plates, that filtered plankton from the sea water, the main food source.|$|E
500|$|Jaws of sharks, {{like those}} of rays and skates, are not {{attached}} to the cranium. The jaw's surface (in comparison to the shark's vertebrae and <b>gill</b> <b>arches)</b> needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called [...] "tesserae", which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic. This gives these areas {{much of the same}} strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.|$|E
500|$|Later in the 19th century, temnospondyls were {{classified}} as various members of Stegocephalia, a name coined by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868. Cope placed stegocephalians in the class Batrachia, the name then used for Amphibia. Stegocephalia means [...] "roof-headed" [...] in Greek, {{a reference to the}} wide, flat heads of temnospondyls and other early tetrapods. During this time, palaeontologists considered temnospondyls to be amphibians because they possessed three main features: <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> in juvenile skeletons, indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands.|$|E

500|$|As filter feeders, {{manta rays}} consume large {{quantities}} of zooplankton {{in the form of}} shrimp, krill and planktonic crabs. An individual manta eats about 13% of its body weight each week. When foraging, it slowly swims around its prey, herding it into a tight [...] "ball" [...] and then speeds through the bunched organisms with a wide-open mouth. If a ball is particularly dense, a manta may somersault through it. While feeding, mantas flatten their cephalic fins to channel food into their mouths and the small particles are collected by the tissue between the <b>gill</b> <b>arches.</b> As many as fifty individual fish may gather at a single, plankton-rich feeding site. Mantas are themselves preyed upon by large sharks and by killer whales. They may also be bitten by cookiecutter sharks, and harbor parasitic copepods.|$|E

50|$|The {{external}} gills commonly {{consist of}} a single stalk (rami) protruding from a <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> behind {{the head of the}} animal, above an associated gill slit. The stalk usually contains muscle tissue, and may be moved by the animal as a free appendage, in order to stir up stagnant water. The stalk is lined by many thinly walled filaments (fimbriae), containing the majority of blood vessels used in gas exchange. Animals usually have one external gill originating on each <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> (except the hyoid), which leads to there being three pairs of external gills in salamanders, and four in the gilled larvae of lungfish.|$|R

The mouth forms a long, wide arch with very short furrows at the corners. The teeth are tiny with typically three cusps in males and five cusps in females; the central cusp is the longest. The upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are over 80 tooth rows in the upper jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits; papillae (nipple-like structures) are present on the <b>gill</b> <b>arches.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The dwarf lanternshark {{appears to}} reach a maximum length of about [...] (female). It has a long, wide, {{flattened}} head comprising a fourth to a fifth of its total length. The eyes are large, {{twice as long as}} high, with the anterior and posterior corners acute. The nares are large and preceded by poorly developed flaps of skin. There are 2532 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 3034 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth of adult males have a single cusp flanked by two pairs of smaller cusplets, while the upper teeth of females are more robust and have only one pair of lateral cusplets flanking the central cusp. The lower teeth each have a single, strongly oblique cusp, and their bases are interlocked to form a continuous cutting surface. Scattered, sparse papillae are inside the mouth and on the edges of the <b>gill</b> <b>arches.</b> The five pairs of gill slits are small.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that the reducible-channel model of filter-feeding can probably be applied to common bream, but not to white bream. According to this model, zooplankton are retained in the channels between the medial gill rakers; the mesh size of the sieve can be reduced by lowering the lateral rakers of the neighbouring <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> into these channels. <b>Gill</b> <b>arch</b> movements may well disturb this mechanism; the depressed lateral gill rakers will move {{in and out of the}} medial channels and also shift out of their centre. We have quantified these disturbances by measuring the <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> movements during filter-feeding in white bream and common bream, using dorsal X-ray films. In both species, the lateral rakers are long enough to bridge the gill slits. It was expected that common bream, which can reduce their channels, would have considerably less shift out of the channel centre than white bream, which cannot reduce their channels. However, the predicted shift is 40 – 50 % of the channel width in white bream and 75 % in common bream. A new, dynamic retention mechanism is proposed for common bream. According to this hypothesis, once a particle is trapped in a reduced channel, the channel walls release mucus and the particle becomes sticky. Hence, particles need to be retained mechanically only during part of the gulping cycle. According to the hypothesis, this is achieved by sideways rotation of the lateral rakers in combination with their tapering shape. Retention mechanisms with interdigitating rakers are expected chiefly in facultative filter-feeders, because such mechanisms are easily disturbed by <b>gill</b> <b>arch</b> movements...|$|R
2500|$|Placoderms, class Placodermi (plate skinned), are extinct {{armoured}} prehistoric fish, {{which appeared}} about 430 Ma in the Early to Middle Silurian. They were mostly wiped {{out during the}} Late Devonian Extinction event, 378 Ma, though some survived and made a slight recovery in diversity during the Famennian epoch before dying out entirely {{at the close of}} the Devonian, 360 mya; they are ultimately ancestal to modern vertebrates. Their head and thorax were covered with massive and often ornamented armoured plates. The rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. The armour shield was articulated, with the head armour hinged to the thoratic armour. This allowed placoderms to lift their heads, unlike ostracoderms. Placoderms were the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their <b>gill</b> <b>arches.</b> The chart on the right shows the rise and demise of the separate placoderm lineages: Acanthothoraci, [...] Rhenanida, [...] Antiarchi, [...] Petalichthyidae, [...] Ptyctodontida and Arthrodira.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> are {{equipped}} with rows of parallel 3-to-12-centimetre-long (1.2-to-4.7-inch-long) gill rakers, in life probably attached to the ceratobranchials via soft tissue. On {{the top of each}} raker one or two rows of dozens of low [...] "teeth" [...] are present. When there are two rows, they are placed on the edges of the upper surface and separated by a deep trough, itself separated from an internal hollow space by a transverse septum. The teeth or [...] "fimbriations" [...] are obliquely directed towards the front and the top. They are grooved at their sides, the striations continuing over the sides of the raker. Detailed study of exquisitely preserved French specimens revealed to Liston that these teeth were, again via soft tissue, each attached to delicate 2-millimetre-long (0.8-inch-long) bony plates, structures that had never before been observed among living or extinct fishes. An earlier hypothesis that the striations would function as sockets for sharp [...] "needle teeth", as with the basking shark, was hereby refuted. The rakers served to filter plankton, the main food supply of Leedsichthys, from the sea water.|$|E
50|$|The African {{lungfishes}} are obligate air breathers, {{with reduced}} gills in the adults. They have two anterior <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> that retain gills, {{though they are}} too small to function as the sole respiratory apparatus. The lungfish heart has adaptations that partially separate the flow of blood into its pulmonary and systemic circuits. The atrium is partially divided, so that the left side receives oxygenated blood and the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the other tissues. These two blood streams remain mostly separate as they flow through the ventricle leading to the <b>gill</b> <b>arches.</b> As a result, oxygenated blood mostly goes to the anterior <b>gill</b> <b>arches</b> and the deoxygenated blood mostly goes to the posterior arches.|$|E
