5|$|News soon {{spread of}} {{thousands}} of Chinese joining forces with Javanese soldiers in Grobogan, outside of Semarang. On 1 May, Visscher was accosted by Captain Rudolph Carel von Glan, a unit leader, asking why Visscher had done nothing {{to deal with the}} uprising. Visscher heatedly replied that it was not Glan's business. The following day, after being questioned by prosecutor Jeronimus Tonnemans Jr., Yonko, and Anko, Visscher became increasingly angry, breaking a table in half and yelling at his Chinese advisers. When Yanko disappeared after the meeting, Anko told Visscher that he had joined the rebelling Chinese. This caused Visscher, who had heavily invested in Yonko and had left a large amount of money with him, to take out his carriage and scream to the residents of Semarang to escape while it was still possible. This continued until he crashed into the city walls. The residents ran away from Semarang <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>panic,</b> leaving eight loaded cannons outside the city walls.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>panic</b> pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind the Lewinsky scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>panic,</b> piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>panic</b> and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
