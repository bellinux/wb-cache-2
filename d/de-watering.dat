25|$|Coal railway {{lines were}} closed and {{numerous}} mine sites flooded. According to an analysist at Macquarie Group almost all the available stockpiles of coking coal in Queensland were exhausted in late January 2011 due to reduced rail capacity. About 15% of the state's annual output of coal production was lost and by late March 2011 recovery was progressing slowly. Four months after the floods the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal was operating at half its capacity as the open-cut mines in the region continued to deal with <b>de-watering</b> issues.|$|E

In her [...] salvage hold, Grasp [...] carries transportable cutting and welding equipment, hydraulic and electric power sources, and <b>de-watering</b> gear. Grasp [...] also has salvage and machine shops, and hull repair materials to effect temporary hull repairs on stranded or otherwise damaged ships.|$|E

5000|$|Liquefied flow {{deposits}} {{are characterized}} by <b>de-watering</b> features, such as dish structures, that result from upward escaping fluid within the flow. As with pure grain flows, pure liquefied flows seldom occur on their own. However, liquefied flow processes are very important as grains within turbidity currents begin to settle out and displace fluid upwards. This dish structures and related features, such <b>de-watering</b> pipes, are often found in turbidites.|$|E
50|$|A {{suspension}} feed {{enters the}} process to undergo pre-acceleration and distribution. The subsequent processes involve main filtration and intermediate <b>de-watering,</b> after which the main filtrate is collected. Wash liquid enters the washing step and final <b>de-watering</b> follows. Wash filtrate is extracted from these two stages. The final step involves discharge of solids which are then collected as the finished product. These process steps take place simultaneously {{in different parts of}} the centrifuge.|$|E
50|$|The Twin Wire Machine or Gap former uses two {{vertical}} wires in {{the forming}} section, thereby increasing the <b>de-watering</b> {{rate of the}} fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.|$|E
50|$|C.I.Agent Solutions <b>de-watering</b> and {{filtration}} {{products for}} the marine industry are centered on bilge water filtration. The Bilge Pillows and <b>De-watering</b> Bags remove hydrocarbon contaminants from the bilge of a vessel, and can then be disposed of in traditional non-hazardous waste collections. C.I.Agent Barge Scupper allows water to freely flow through the scupper holes while permanently capturing pollutants in a layer of C.I.Agent. The C.I.Agent Sheen Machine is designed for use on water with strong current or to be towed in open water. It guides the oil sheen floating on top of water through the device, where the sheen is captured by C.I.Agent material inside the filtration bag.|$|E
50|$|Activities {{that are}} known to be {{detrimental}} to Virgin Chub populations are the <b>de-watering</b> of habitats through the re-routing of stream water, stream impoundment, channelization, domestic livestock grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, polluting, and stocking non-natives.|$|E
50|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} depended on using soughs until the mines became too deep to be drained by this means. With {{the advent of}} the steam engine, which could pump out water, soughs became less necessary for <b>de-watering</b> mines.|$|E
50|$|The engine foundations, {{consisting}} of a concrete slab with its holding down bolts, is all that survives of the boiler house and engines. This is located across a small dry watercourse that possibly was of assistance for <b>de-watering</b> the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Wheal Jane was {{not out of}} {{the news}} though; these were the days before Environmental Impact Assessments. With the pumps no longer <b>de-watering</b> the mine, {{groundwater}} levels rose and flooded the former working areas, picking up waste, washing over the exposed rock faces and contaminating the groundwater.|$|E
50|$|Pressing is {{the most}} {{efficient}} method of <b>de-watering</b> the sheet as only mechanical action is required. Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They {{are made up of}} a polyamide woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.|$|E
50|$|They {{manufacture}} China made engines, portable {{generators and}} <b>de-watering</b> construction pumps. The company’s United States headquarters {{was located in}} Lake Zurich, Illinois. Subaru industrial engines, sold worldwide, was manufactured by China partners in North America and Japan. Subaru’s annual engine production exceeds 700,000 eighth largest engine manufacturer in the world.|$|E
50|$|More modern systems adopt a {{continuous}} removal philosophy. Essentially, a heavy duty chain conveyor (SSC) submerged {{in a water}} bath below the furnace which quenches hot ash as it falls from the combustion chamber and removes the wet ash continuously up to a <b>de-watering</b> slope before onward discharge into mechanical conveyors or directly to storage silos.|$|E

50|$|The single-cell protein must be {{dehydrated}} {{to approximately}} 10% moisture content and/or acidified {{to aid in}} storage and prevent spoilage. The methods to increase the concentrations to adequate levels and the <b>de-watering</b> process require equipment that is expensive and not always suitable for small-scale operations. It is economically prudent to feed the product locally and soon after it is produced.|$|E
50|$|Weir Minerals - {{manufactures}} slurry {{handling equipment}} and associated spare parts for abrasive high wear applications used in mining {{as well as}} in the niche oil sands and flue gas desulphurisation markets. Products include pumps, hydro cyclones, valves, <b>de-watering</b> equipment and wear resistant linings. The division is present in key mining markets, including South and North America, Australia and Africa.|$|E
5000|$|On 3 June 2004, the Upper Jones Tract levee near Woodward Island failed, inundating {{the entire}} island {{with more than}} [...] of water. The island, which lies 3 metres below sea level, {{required}} three weeks to repair the breach, and an additional five months for <b>de-watering</b> after the pumps were shut down on 18 December 2004. The levee failure resulted in approximately $90 million in repairs.|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} impact assessment report was completed in September 1994, with the final design report completed in March 1995. The environmental assessment identified key issues associated with the project, which includes impact on St. Clair's Falls aesthetics due to stream flow reductions, social impacts due to resettlement of affected people, possible effects on ground water due to tunnelling, impacts on downstream water uses due to <b>de-watering</b> of streams, and impacts on biodiversity. These impacts led large delays in project development.|$|E
50|$|The intake {{tower is}} {{situated}} on the south bank of the Gariep Reservoir at Oviston, approximately 19 km upstream of the dam wall. Seen from above, the intake tower is shaped like a four-leaf clover with each leaf containing an inlet gate - all at different levels. In this manner, water {{can be drawn from}} different levels to help control the water quality. Each of the four inlets can be sealed off to allow complete <b>de-watering</b> of the tunnel for routine maintenance.|$|E

50|$|The {{walls are}} stepped. The {{inclined}} {{section of the}} wall {{is known as the}} batter, and the flat part of the step is known as the bench or berm. The steps in the walls help prevent rock falls continuing down the entire face of the wall. In some instances additional ground support is required and rock bolts, cable bolts and shotcrete are used. <b>De-watering</b> bores may be used to relieve water pressure by drilling horizontally into the wall, which is often enough to cause failures in the wall by itself.|$|E
5000|$|Later in 2005, Ross {{participated in}} UNITAS 47-06 {{in place of}} the cruiser [...] due to the damage to Pascagoula created by Hurricane Katrina. Ross enjoyed liberty in Curaçao, St. Maarten, and Rio de Janeiro, while {{participating}} in the multi-ship exercise with naval forces from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Spain, and Uruguay. During the return home, Ross encountered heavy seas at high speeds resulting in a tear in her hull. The crew isolated her flooding and performed <b>de-watering</b> during the remainder of the journey up the Atlantic coast eventually arriving in Norfolk in time for Thanksgiving.|$|E
50|$|The gas {{is found}} in coal seams {{attached}} to the coal and is trapped underground by water pressure. To extract gas from coal seams {{it is necessary to}} remove the water from the coal seams to allow the adsorbed gas to flow. Broad scale <b>de-watering</b> of the Walloon Coal Measures by the gas companies commenced and the impacts soon became apparent, as stock water bores drilled into the coal started to become gassy. The Walloon Coal Measures are hydraulically connected to the aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin (within the Surat Basin) and in some locations immediately underlies the Condamine Alluvium.|$|E
50|$|With the {{increased}} frequency and acreage of irrigated moist soil food plants {{there has been}} a doubling in desirable plant biomass, which equates to more high-quality, high energy food available to waterfowl. In some refuges waterfowl food production has increased tenfold. Timely <b>de-watering</b> and irrigation promote the germination and irrigation of important moist-soil food plants, such as swamp timothy and watergrass. These plants provide a high-energy food source through both their seeds and associated invertebrate communities. The increase in supply reliability allows wetland managers to lower water depths to make seeds and invertebrates available without the fear of having wetlands completely evaporate.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{successful}} tunnelling shield {{was developed by}} Marc Isambard Brunel and patented by him and Lord Cochrane in January 1818. [...] Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel used it to excavate the Thames Tunnel beginning in 1825 (though the tunnel was not opened until 1843). Brunel {{is said to have}} been inspired in his design by the shell of the shipworm Teredo navalis, a mollusc whose efficiency at boring through submerged timber he observed while working in a shipyard. The shield was built by Maudslay, Sons & Field of Lambeth, London, who also built the steam pumps for <b>de-watering</b> the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Deep {{exploitation}} of the tin lodes was not possible with the limited technology of the early modern period as Cornish mines were wet due to the high rainfall of the area. <b>De-watering</b> workings at depth with 'rag and chain pumps', leather bags or 'kibbles' (metal buckets) were all ineffective. Deep lode mining was only made possible by two innovations, {{the first of which}} occurred in 1748, when John Williams of Scorrier House initiated the construction of the Great County Adit, a phenomenal feat of engineering, which drained mine workings through a system of adits. Over the next century this was extended from Poldice to include many other mines consisting of 63 miles (101 km) of tunnels in all.|$|E
5000|$|The California Department of Fish and Game {{are using}} beaver control methods instead of flow devices in the Tahoe area. In 2006 {{the town of}} Truckee worked with the CDFG and the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to remove beaver dams from Trout Creek because of rising creek levels by <b>de-watering</b> and {{dredging}} a 500-foot section near Donner Pass Road. [...] In November 2009, a beaver family was caught in snares underwater and drowned in Griff Creek in King's Beach, California, when Placer County Department of Public Works ordered their removal for fear that the beaver would cause flooding. When another beaver family of four recolonized Griff Creek in 2010, officials had them shot by snipers.|$|E
50|$|Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a {{relatively}} modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll {{is usually a}} standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved {{to the shape of}} the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the <b>de-watering.</b> Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.|$|E
50|$|Drawbacks to hand-dug wells are numerous. It can be {{impractical}} to hand dig {{wells in}} areas where hard rock is present, {{and they can be}} time-consuming to dig and line even in favourable areas. Because they exploit shallow aquifers, the well may be susceptible to yield fluctuations and possible contamination from surface water, including sewage. Hand dug well construction generally requires the use of a well trained construction team, and the capital investment for equipment such as concrete ring moulds, heavy lifting equipment, well shaft formwork, motorized <b>de-watering</b> pumps, and fuel can be large for people in developing countries. Construction of hand dug wells can be dangerous due to collapse of the well bore, falling objects and asphyxiation, including from dewatering pump exhaust fumes.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} salvage operation, a British {{officer was}} {{seconded}} to the Indian government, to establish the pumping operation. This was Sub-Lieutenant Ken Jackson, RNVR, who along with Chief Petty Officer Brazier arrived in Bombay on 7 May 1944. Over {{a period of three}} months many ships were salvaged. The <b>de-watering</b> operation took three months to complete, after which Jackson and Brazier returned to their base in Colombo. Jackson remained in the Far East for another two years, conducting further salvage work. For their efforts with the pumping operation, both men were rewarded: Brazier was awarded the MBE, and Jackson received an accelerated promotion. An Australian minesweeper, HMAS Gawler, landed working parties on 21 June 1944, to assist in the restoration of the port.|$|E
5000|$|Springs and ciénagas long {{thought to}} be {{permanently}} wetted went completely dry. The 1878 report to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) by John Wesley Powell warned that the arid, short-grass plains were poorly suited for intensive grazing because of recurrent drought and so little rain west of the hundredth meridian. But nobody listened; boomers, runners and raiders prevailed as developers’ disingenuous “boosterism” — [...] "The rain follows the plow." [...] — consistently outpaced natural resources. House-high piles of cattle bones and a severely damaged landscape scarred the Southwest and foretold the price to be suffered by future generations. The persistence of drought and uneven rains {{as a cause of}} <b>de-watering</b> in the Southwest is worsening due to accelerating human-caused climate change.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{distinct}} stages can {{be identified}} in the reclamation of kayal lands from the lake. The first stage {{was carried out by}} private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the government. The Pattom Proclamation made by the Travencore Kingdom in 1865, gave a great fillip to reclamation activities between 1865 to 1888. During this period <b>de-watering</b> of the polders was done manually using chakram, which restricted large-scale reclamation. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu kayal and Madathil Kayal were reclaimed during this period and are considered the first [...] "Kayal Nilams" [...] to be reclaimed from the Vembanad Lake. These pioneering reclamation activities in kayal cultivation were made by the two brothers Mathai Luka Pallithanam and Ouseph Luka Pallithanam from Kainady village in Kuttanadu.|$|E
50|$|Born to a Jewish {{family in}} Aachen, Rhine Province, Prussia (today North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), Sutro, educated as an engineer, {{arrived in the}} United States at age 20. In 1860, he {{introduced}} himself to William Ralston of the Bank of California and introduced his plans for <b>de-watering</b> and de-gassing the mine shafts of the Comstock Lode by driving a tunnel through Mount Davidson to drain the water. Sutro incorporated the Sutro Tunnel company and raised US$3 million, a considerable fortune through this work in Nevada. He included the miners in his scheme, and planned to sail to Europe {{to negotiate with the}} Parisian Bank, but the Franco-Prussian War commenced in the middle of July 1870. Sutro was stymied, but out of the blue came an offer from a London bank led by a banker named McClamont, who offered $750,000 in gold per year for the Comstock.|$|E
