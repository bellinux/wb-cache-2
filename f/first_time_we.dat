5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

Praxiteles made the female nude respectable {{for the first time in}} the Late Classical period (mid-4th century): his Aphrodite of Knidos, which survives in copies, was said by Pliny to be the greatest statue in the world.|$|E
25|$|Collins: We went {{to another}} place actually, we went to California, to the California Folk festival in Berkeley, this was {{sometime}} in the summer. And we stopped off in Chicago and stayed with Studs Terkel who was a hospitable man and his wonderful hospitable wife. Caught the train out to San Francisco from Chicago, which was an incredible experience. Sang at the Berkeley festival and met Jimmy Driftwood there for the <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> all hit it off wonderfully.|$|E

500|$|The band took {{a relaxed}} {{approach}} to recording. For five months, the trio stayed at a Hollywood hotel during the recording sessions, {{where they would}} often play loud music late at night, prompting complaints. The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment: [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> separated from our pasts, from how {{we were supposed to}} behave as Green Day. For the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars." [...] American Idiot took ten months to complete, at a cost of $650,000. By the end of the process, Armstrong felt [...] "delirious" [...] regarding the album: [...] "I feel like I'm on the cusp of something with this. [...] I really feel [...] like we're really peaking right now." ...|$|E
500|$|King {{returned}} in July 1962, {{and was sentenced}} to forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine. He chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. [...] "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools... ejected from churches... and thrown into jail... But for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> witnessed being kicked out of jail." [...] It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out of jail during this time.|$|E
500|$|The second edition, {{published}} in 1985, included several {{changes such as}} 37 new species, 12 new plates of illustrations, the inclusion of endemic species of the Baja California Peninsula, and new common names chosen to enhance clarity. In his 1986 review, Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge: [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known." [...] Concerned {{about the impact of}} over-collecting, Stebbins reduced coverage of collecting and keeping animals, and also removed a section on handling venomous snakes.|$|E

Garran, along with others such as Atlee Hunt, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, Barton coined the phrase [...] "For the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation"; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase [...] "would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down." ...|$|E
500|$|At Franz Joseph's request, Zita and her {{children}} left their residence at Hetzendorf and moved into a suite of rooms at Schönbrunn Palace. Here, Zita spent many hours with the old Emperor on both formal and informal occasions, where Franz Joseph confided in her his fears for the future. Emperor Franz Joseph died of bronchitis and pneumonia {{at the age of}} 86 on 21 November 1916. [...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, with tears in his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead. As he did so he said, 'May God bless Your Majesty.' It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had heard the Imperial title used to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Evicted!" [...] {{was largely}} positive. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best {{moment in the}} series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet her and she's awesome." [...] He later wrote that [...] "Marceline = best". Marceline {{has gone on to}} be one of the most popular characters with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of [...] "Evicted!" [...] her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt [...] "good about that. It's nice". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that [...] "emotional complexity" [...] lies [...] "beneath Adventure Times weirdness".|$|E

500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> ever heard of that, but they said because we were a band going to be touring {{around the world in}} 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E
500|$|García Márquez was {{inspired}} to write a dictator novel when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez. He shares, [...] "it was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> had seen a dictator fall in Latin America." [...] García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch (El otoño del patriarca) in 1968 {{and said it was}} finished in 1971; however, he continued to embellish the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain. According to García Márquez, the novel is a [...] "poem on the solitude of power" [...] as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General. The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related {{to the life of the}} General, which do not appear in chronological order. Although the exact location of the story is not pin-pointed in the novel, the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} film the episode without {{exceeding}} the budget, director Rob Bowman used {{a combination of}} [...] "clever camera angles, strategic use of breakaway cement, and—in the case of Mulder's trunk lid—the miracle of auto-body repair substance Bondo". Bowman was most proud of the scene where Mulder pushes on the prison's walls, only to have it crumble {{in the shape of}} a man. He explained that, [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> did it, all we got was a big square hole [...] but we didn't want it to look like Bugs Bunny with his ears sticking out, either". Eventually, the crew was able to create a breakaway section that [...] "suggested, rather than outlined perfectly", the shape of a human body. Finally, hair department head Dena Green was instructed to sweep Diehl's hair to the back of his head during any scene that featured him after he had walked through a solid object.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and it is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> really see George as the character we know and love, that weird dark shadow of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline has {{attracted}} positive critical attention. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised {{that the fact}} that she is one [...] "of this show’s most tragic characters". He later wrote that her addition [...] "was a major turning point for the series, introducing a hip, adventure-loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo’s past." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "she’s been at the center of some of the show’s most emotional episodes", and [...] "beyond her dramatic value, Marceline tends to just make every episode better" [...] because [...] "her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her". Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as [...] "one of the radder characters" [...] in the series. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in [...] "Evicted!" [...] as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that [...] "sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> meet her and she's awesome." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really in this world, {{and there was just}} something really beautifully right about the idea that the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She {{noted that the}} episode [...] "suffers from a {{syndrome}} that has afflicted a great many X-Files episodes in recent seasons [...] the syndrome consists of the audience finding out early on who the guilty party is." [...] Vitaris, however, did note that the episode's [...] "saving grace" [...] was Vince Gilligan's satiric writing tone; she called the scene featuring Roberts hallucinating that the burgers he was frying were actually brains [...] "sick, but hilarious". Other reviews were more negative. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, noting that, although the change in perspective was unique and interesting, [...] "this bit of originality does not rescue the episode from a familiarity bordering on the mundane. It's not the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> have seen genetic mutants who have an affinity for human body parts." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a relatively negative review. Despite noting that the episode wasn't a [...] "horrible" [...] entry for The X-Files, Kessenich was unhappy with the characterization of Rob Roberts {{as well as the}} fact that the killer was revealed very quickly.|$|E
