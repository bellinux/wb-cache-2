25|$|The institutionally {{independent}} {{foundation of}} Paul Gerhardt Stift, located in Müllerstraße 58 {{at the corner}} with Barfusstraße within the parochial boundaries, was run by deaconesses. The staff was divided in its allegiances to the German Christians and the Confessing Christians. While the institution's two chaplains, Pastor Urner and Pastor Hermann Wagner stuck with the Confessing Church, the matron deaconess sided with the German Christians. In the morning prayers led by her she included Adolf Hitler in her rogations, while the two pastors on their turn never did so. The deaconess leading the medical station of the Paul Gerhardt Stift, an active Confessing Christian in the neighbouring Nazareth Congregation, and other colleagues of her, continued to treat Jewish patients even after this was strictly forbidden in 1938 and therefore could not be <b>invoiced</b> to the health insurance anymore.|$|E

2500|$|When {{they turned}} their {{attention}} to the Brandon Engine in 1890, it was in a worse state than expected. The drains in the northern and southern sections of the Burnt Fen were by then interconnected, so that either engine could pump the whole area in an emergency, and plans for a new Brandon Engine were made immediately. Following the success of the Lark Engine, Hathorn, Davey and Co. were contacted, and supplied a pump set capable of pumping 75 tons per minute, which was operational by October 1892. Although the pump worked well, there were protracted arguments over a set of spanners which had been <b>invoiced</b> as an [...] "extra".|$|E
5000|$|This {{process is}} {{straightforward}} but can become very cumbersome, {{especially if the}} company has {{a very large number of}} <b>invoices.</b> This problem is compounded when <b>invoices</b> that require processing are on paper. This can lead to lost <b>invoices,</b> human error during data entry, and <b>invoice</b> duplicates. These and other problems lead to a high cost per <b>invoice</b> metric. The goal of automating the accounts payable department is to streamline this <b>invoicing</b> process, eliminate potential human error, and lower the cost per <b>invoice</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Electronic <b>Invoicing</b> {{can be a}} {{very useful}} tool for the AP department. Electronic <b>invoicing</b> allows vendors to submit <b>invoices</b> over the {{internet}} and have those <b>invoices</b> automatically routed and processed. Because <b>invoice</b> arrival and presentation is almost immediate <b>invoices</b> are paid sooner; therefore, the amount of time and money it takes to process these <b>invoices</b> is greatly reduced. (Financial Operations Networks, 2008) These solutions usually involve a third party company that provides and supports an application which allows a supplier to submit an electronic <b>invoice</b> to their customer for immediate routing, approval, and payment. These applications are tied to databases which archive transaction information between trading partners. (US Bank, Scott Hesse, 2010) The <b>invoices</b> may be submitted in a number of ways, including EDI, CSV, or XML uploads. PDF files, or online <b>invoice</b> templates. Because E-invoicing includes so many different technologies and entry options, it is used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which an <b>invoice</b> is electronically presented to a customer for payment.|$|R

Of the wounded, nearly all were still in their hammocks. Among the remainder, some sixteen or eighteen suffered by our close and destructive broadside on the present occasion, reducing the efficient part of her crew to about our own numbers.

Mr. Clinch had the weakness of a majority of his sex in believing that he was a good judge of wine and women.

I answered 'Yes, that was all right,' and did not undeceive him about their contents. Then I asked how they had arrived, and if he had not received a letter with them. He replied that one morning before the warehouse was open, some natives had brought them down in a canoe, and dumped them at the door, telling the watchman that they had been paid to deliver them there by some other natives whom they met a long way up the river. Then they went away without leaving any letter or message. Well, I thanked Aston and paid his charges and there's an end of the matter. Those fifty-three cases are now in the hold <b>invoiced</b> as ore samples and, as I inspected them myself and am sure that they have not been tampered with, besides the value of the necklace the Asika gave me we've got £100,000 to begin our married life upon with something over for old Jeekie, and I daresay we shall do very well on that." ...|$|E

Then that blundering through the Straits, though it must never be talked of in any other light than a bold push for a quick passage, did us a wonderful deal of good, shoving us ahead near a month in time. It has put us so much ahead of our calculations, indeed, that I would cruise for Frenchmen for five or six weeks, were there the least probability that one of the chaps was to the westward of the Horn. Such not being the fact, however, and there still being a very long road before us, I have thought it best to push for the next point of destination.
