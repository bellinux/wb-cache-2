5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI led {{directly}} to his <b>dismissal</b> on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his <b>dismissal</b> was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} Test at Lord's Collingwood succumbed to a loose first-innings <b>dismissal,</b> {{chipping}} part-time spinner Michael Clarke to mid-on for 16 (and earning {{the ire of}} his captain Andrew Strauss, {{who went on to}} score 161); England, poised at 302 for 3 before Collingwood's <b>dismissal,</b> subsided to 425 all out. Nonetheless, England's seamers bowled Australia out for 215, and in the second innings Collingwood scored a measured 54, acting as foil to the aggressive strokeplay of Matt Prior (their partnership adding 86 in twelve overs) and Andrew Flintoff (51 in eight overs). As Flintoff and Graeme Swann combined to bowl England to victory, Collingwood contributed two fine slip catches.|$|E

5|$|The 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, {{also known}} simply as the <b>Dismissal,</b> {{has been described as}} the greatest political and constitutional crisis in Australian history.

5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect <b>dismissal</b> as by a correct <b>dismissal,</b> both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering v.

There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from <b>dismissal</b> was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
