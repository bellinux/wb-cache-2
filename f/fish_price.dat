40|$|This paper re-examines the {{evidence}} of causality and <b>price</b> transmission between <b>fish</b> <b>prices</b> of main species landed into Piraeus (Greece) and Cornwall (UK). To complete the analysis of cointegration and causality, we use the data of Floros and Failler (2004) and Avdelas (2004). Our paper uses the Bivariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (BGARCH) model. The Bivariate cointegration model (with GARCH error structure) incorporates a time varying conditional correlation coefficient between <b>fish</b> <b>prices</b> and generates time-varying covariances. The results from BGARCH show evidence of volatility clustering in the change of <b>fish</b> <b>prices,</b> and report that most species lead Hake (this is stronger for Greece). Furthermore, the estimates of price transmission indicate {{that the rate of}} change of Shrimp/Dentex partially adjusts to the rate of change of Hake prices. Our results suggest significant imperfect price transmission between species (this is stronger for Greece) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract onlyEmploying an {{experimental}} approach, we examine whet her the uncertainty on the fish/outputs price affects {{the choice of}} vessel sizes of fishers under an ITQ scheme. Our experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, subjects answer ten questions. The purpose is to extract the risk preference of each subject. The second part consists of two stages. Subjects choose a large- or a small-scale vessel (production method) in the first stage. They {{do not know the}} <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> with certainty at this point. After this stage is finished, the <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> is announced. Then, in the second stage, they transact their fishing quotas in the quota market. We conducted 8 sessions; 12 subjects participated in each session; and the second part in each session was composed of 10 periods/rounds. We find that the average trading price of quotas converges to the theoretical equilibrium price given the numbers of both types of vessels, although the average trading prices in the first few rounds are clearly higher than the theoretical ones. We also find that the number of large-scale vessels is smaller than that in the Nash equilibrium without any uncertainty on the <b>fish</b> <b>price.</b> Moreover, it is obtained that the higher the degree of risk-aversion of a subject, {{the more likely it is}} that s/he chooses a small-scale vessel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has {{for years}} {{compiled}} prices and indexes for all major food categories, except fisheries. This gap {{has now been}} filled, and a <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> index has been developed. The FAO <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> index (FPI) relies on trade statistics because seafood is heavily traded internationally, exposing non-traded seafood to price competition from imports and exports. Easily updated trade data can thus proxy for domestic seafood prices {{that are difficult to}} observe in many regions and costly to update with global coverage. Calculations of the extent of price competition in different countries support the plausibility of reliance on trade data. Overall, the FPI shows less volatility and fewer price spikes than other food price indices including oils, cereals, and dairy. The FPI generally reflects seafood scarcity, {{but it can also be}} separated into indices by production technology, fish species, or region. Splitting FPI into capture fisheries and aquaculture suggests increased scarcity of capture fishery resources in recent years, but also growth in aquaculture that is keeping pace with demand...|$|E

A salient feature of the fish meal market is the impact of El Niño events on fish meal supply. This possibly leads to two different price regimes, one where the <b>fish</b> meal <b>price</b> is highly correlated with the soybean meal price, and another, during El Niño events, where fish meal supply is low and the <b>fish</b> meal <b>price</b> is not strongly correlated with the soybean meal price. The results from the Markov-switching autoregressions indicate two price regimes where one is mostly governed by the soybean meal price while the other is governed by the level of stocks-to-use...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between fish market price and body size {{has not been}} explored much in fisheries science. Here, the mean market prices and fish body size were collected {{in order to examine}} the hypothesis that large fish, both among- and within-species, are being selectively targeted by fisheries because they may yield greater profit. Trophic levels, vulnerability to fishing and global landings were also collected because these variables may also be related to the market <b>fish</b> <b>price.</b> These relationships were examined using generalized additive models (GAM), which showed that, among species, fish market price was positively dependent on maximum total length (P = 0. 0024) and negatively on landings (P = 0. 0006), whereas it was independent of trophic level (P > 0. 05) and vulnerability to fishing (P > 0. 05). When the <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> vs. size relationship was tested within-species, large individuals were consistently attaining higher market prices compared to their medium and small-sized counterparts. We conclude that the selective removal of the larger fish, which is driven by their market price {{and to a lesser extent}} by their availability, may contribute to their overfishing...|$|E
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} are to analyze the market price of fish commodity and to forecast behaviour of <b>fish</b> <b>price.</b> Fish types that are analysed in {{this research}} are tongkol.

In addition, analyses of the market structure and market behavior were utilized to describe the market performance that was significantly occurred in the fish market. Results show that (1) market integration occurred is imperfect integration or oligopsony; (2) market behavior is relatively varied, i. e., retailers tend to increase <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> if the market price is sharply increasing, but they are very slow in reducing the price if the <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> is decreasing; (3) for each market location, retailer is fewer than fish producer; no barriers for producer and retailer to entry and exit from the market; in general fresh fish marketed have high quality except for condition of the abundant catch where some fish are stored in the cool box for seiling at the next day...|$|E

40|$|Fisheries in Madura {{generally}} remain {{still more}} undeveloped {{in comparison with}} East Java. Any fishing and fish farming are adhere to the traditional ways as shown in typical poor fishing facilities and equipment resulting in low productivity and low <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> and low income, however, these situations {{are going to be}} rapidly changed. Fishing households depend mainly on artisanal fisheries due to less employment opportunities. Their family members are much more than the family in the town, and their activities play an important role to supplement their livelihood economy. Such situation found in fishing households causes an overcrowded use of coastal fishing ground and a strain between their artisanal fisheries and more effective ones. Large part of the catch from small scale fisheries is sold directly in the rural market through negotiation by women of fishing household to rural inhabitants at remarkable low price. The amount of expenditure is very low due to low income, and they spend majority of their income for foodstuff and daily commodity, in consequence, they have a few life facility and few durable consuming goods.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a semiqualitative approach to analyse the joint dynamics of fleets and stocks in a multispecies, multifleet fishery.

Resource status is measured by abundance and length metrics; fleet capacity is measured by total horse power, and economic metrics such as profitability and earnings are examined as well. A maximum likelihood approach is used to identify the combined metric trends with the largest support in the data. The approach {{is applied to the}} French Bay of Biscay fisheries in 2000 - 2007. Combined-metric time trends suggest that decreases in fleet capacity did not result in decreasing fishing impacts; trends in stocks and <b>fish</b> <b>prices</b> were not the major drivers of changes in fleets either. Rather, the vessel buyback program might have been the main factor determining fleet dynamics over that period...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} explore fish {{consumption}} behavior and fish farming attitude of the Saudi households in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The survey was conducted in Sharurah town situated in Najran province. The data were collected through a well-structured questionnaire from 100 respondents residing in the province. Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to see the significant and non-significant impact of the two variables. The results showed that majority (37 %) of the respondents fell in {{the age group of}} 25 – 34 and majority (35 %) of the respondents have high level of education i. e. up to university level. The results also depicted that majority (31 %) of the people consume fish and were aware of the nutritional value of fish. However, majority (85 %) of the respondents were not satisfied by the <b>fish</b> <b>price.</b> The results further indicated that none of the respondent was engaged in fish farming activity i. e. they had no fish farms at their homes. Furthermore, majority (83 %) respondents had no intentions to start fish farming at their homes in future. The study concludes that fish consumption and preference is high in the study area and people prefer fish more than chicken and meat for consumption purposes because of their knowledge regarding the nutritional value of fish. However, the age and educational level have negative impact on the respondent’s opinion about <b>fish</b> <b>price</b> in the study area.

40|$|Fish {{markets can}} be {{expanded}} by two means, first by attracting newcomers {{in a local}} trading room and secondly by allowing remote bidders to participate. In both cases, electronic systems have {{played a key role}} in French primary fish markets. The computerisation of trading rooms started in the mid 1980 s while connection through Intranet or Internet systems first started in the mid- 1990 s and then has spread more actively in France since 2007. However, the socioeconomic impact (on prices for example) of expanding markets by electronic means is far from being clearly predictable. First based on an econometric analysis, this article presents evidence of increases in price level and variability after the implementation of local electronic auction systems. Secondly, a comprehensive survey of the 40 fish auction markets in France brings additional information about the effects of electronic remote bidding on <b>fish</b> <b>prices.</b> The analysis of these two empirical outcomes uses the cross-fertilization of the positivist auction theory in economics with the constructionist approach of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in sociology to enrich the potential hypotheses lying behind the study of the structural impact of electronic systems on market prices.

40|$|In this paper, the own and cross-price flexibilities {{for four}} high valued species (bass, lobster, sole and turbot) {{landed in the}} UK are estimated. System of {{equation}} models were developed using the vector error correction model (VECM) approach. Johansen's multivariate approach was used to obtain estimates of the long run steady state relationship (vectors) between <b>fish</b> <b>prices</b> and landings. To find unique vectors (i. e. no interdependent vectors) zero restrictions on the coefficients of the price variables were applied so that the model effectively contained quantity independent variables only. The resulting vectors were four unique cointegration long run relationships of monthly <b>fish</b> <b>prices</b> and landings. Various tests suggested that the variables were I (1) nonstationary variables. The model also suggested {{that there are more}} than one cointegration vectors (relationships) between the variables. It was found that bass has the largest absolute long run own price flexibility. Bass and lobster were found to be weak substitutes while sole and turbot were found to be substitutes. The results suggest, however, that the relationship is not symmetrical, with the quantity of sole having a greater effect on the price of turbot than turbot on sole. ...|$|R
