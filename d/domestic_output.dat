[...] One of the largest seizures was a joint operation in Arizona, Texas and California that seized seventy-seven containers of fake [...] "Nike Air Jordan" [...] shoes and a container of [...] "Abercrombie & Fitch" [...] clothing, valued at $69.5 million. Another current method of attacking counterfeits is at the retail level. Fendi sued the Sam's Club division of Walmart for selling fake [...] "Fendi" [...] bags and leather goods in five states. Sam's Club agreed to pay Fendi a confidential amount {{to settle the dispute}} and dismiss the action.

A structural vector autoregression method is used in modeling national outputs as determined by global, regional, and country-specific shocks. We find that <b>domestic</b> <b>outputs</b> of the CFA franc zone countries are strongly influenced by country-specific shocks while regional shocks are far more important in European countries that have joined the EMU. The results suggest that the CFA franc zone countries are structurally different from each other and thus {{are more likely to be}} subjected to asymmetric shocks. They do not appear to form an optimum currency area and the monetary union may have been a costly arrangement for the member countries unless they are compensated with some other benefits.

The discussion focuses on the results obtained from the drought-exempt case, which was similar to but more significant than the flood-exempt case, because the drought in 2007 was the most widespread in recent years and was also more serious than the flood. In both cases, real GDP obtained insignificant positive effects contributed by the rise of agricultural output, but the effects on nominal GDP was negative. All agricultural productions increased their outputs and exports, especially for sorghum, oil seed and corn. Another finding was that more capital and less labor were related to most crop productions. All food productions also increased their outputs and exports, thus their energy inputs increased, especially for sugar, meats and vegetables. Households benefited from lower prices for all agricultural and food products from more <b>domestic</b> <b>outputs</b> and fewer imports. However, more food consumption and higher welfare occurred in urban households rather than in rural households. This was due to the declines in the returns of cropland and in th...|$|R

Centering the world's (2008 to 2009) oil and food price catastrophe, here we investigate Malaysian experiences from recession to economic instability. An applied computable general equilibrium model is utilized in our study to simulate the Malaysian economic impacts by three scenarios. First is food import price increase by 20 % (Scenario 1), second is the oil price catastrophe by 40 % (Scenario 2) and finally a scenario that combines Scenarios 1 and 2 simultaneously (Scenario 3). Our results depict the multidimensional impacts on major macroeconomic indicators from recession to economic instability. Our results indicate that, price catastrophe either in Scenario 1 or 2, or in Scenario 3, depress overall Malaysian <b>domestic</b> <b>outputs</b> and exports.
