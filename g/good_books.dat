5000|$|A <b>good</b> <b>book</b> is {{not only}} useful, it gives us joy, {{enriching}} our spirit with new knowledge, and educating our emotions with noble feelings. A <b>good</b> <b>book</b> is always useful. In good times, it enriches our joy, in bad times, it provides consolation and strength, [...] It teaches us, to accept the tragedies of life. A <b>good</b> <b>book</b> will never leave us. It will not change, its principles will not change either. From all this, one can easily understand, why a <b>good</b> <b>book</b> {{is the best of}} friends.|$|R

The first edition was reviewed by The Times, which described it as containing material sufficient for two <b>good</b> <b>books</b> and one bad one, with the bad one being the more interesting.|$|E
25|$|Title xi, Of Books and Newspapers.-(i) Parents should guard their {{children}} against bad books.

When a Catholic newspaper has a bishop's approbation, this means only that he judges that nothing will be published against faith or morals in its pages. He does not make himself responsible, however, for all that the paper contains.|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of The Slave Community {{as one of}} the first studies of slavery from the perspective of the slave was recognized by historians. The book nonetheless received heavy criticism by academics who disagreed with Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources. Historian George P. Rawick noted in 1976, however, that the criticism [...] "should not obscure the fact that [...] book was of such merit as to warrant spending our time criticizing it four years after its publication. Yet, like many <b>good</b> <b>books,</b> it should have been better." ...|$|E

500|$|Following an {{incident}} in which Natasha sprays graffiti around Ramsay Street, Michael disowns his daughter and ignores her attempts {{to get back in}} his <b>good</b> <b>books.</b> Natasha finds the situation weird and she is hurt by her father's actions. Novakovic said Natasha is disappointed in herself for hurting Michael so much. Natasha responds by taking advantage of her new independence to try to get Michael's attention. She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside. Of how Natasha feels about this, Novakovic said [...] "She knows how much her father loves her which is why this is even more jarring, as she realises it must be killing her father to act this way." [...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it is not an easy journey and they have a lot to work through. Novakovic told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline would change Natasha and she would become more sensitive and less self-absorbed.|$|E
