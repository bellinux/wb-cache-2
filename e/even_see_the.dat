5|$|The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave varying {{praise to}} the Lynx version's {{controls}} and graphics, but concurred {{that on the}} smaller portable screen Desert Strike loses much of its impact and playability, as {{it is difficult to}} identify enemies or <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> bullets the player character fires.|$|E

25|$|A static {{electric}} charge can be created whenever two surfaces contact and separate, {{and at least one}} of the surfaces has a high resistance to electric current (and is therefore an electrical insulator). The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E

500|$|Halley's 1986 {{apparition}} was {{the least}} favorable on record. The comet and Earth were {{on opposite sides of}} the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley's closest approach was 0.42 AU. [...] Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera. The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built 24-inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg (then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.|$|E
500|$|Jaws {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it}} [...] "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works {{all the better}} because it's populated with characters {{that have been developed}} into human beings". Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 1967, a Thai Airways International Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III {{crashed into}} Victoria Harbour {{while trying to}} land during a torrential rainstorm. A typhoon was some [...] NW of Hong Kong, but the colony was not closed down in {{preparation}} of the typhoon. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft, unable to <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> runway due to {{the density of the}} rain, allegedly made an abrupt heading change, causing the aircraft to enter into a high rate of descent and crash into harbour waters {{to the right of the}} runway. The starboard wing snapped off on impact, and the aircraft rolled onto its starboard side, halving the number of escape routes. 24 were killed, but only 23 bodies were recovered at the scene. The final body was recovered after it was seen floating in the harbour six weeks later.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stone Free" [...] is an uptempo song {{which has}} a strong rhythmic element, {{due in large part}} to Mitchell's jazz-influenced {{drumming}} approach. [...] Although he [...] "constantly underlines Hendrix's vocals and guitar parts in a dramatic fashion [...] fills and changes of rhythmic emphases", Mitchell continues to [...] "stress the snare beat" [...] and adds quarter-notes on the cowbell. [...] Redding's bass line provides harmonic support similar to a rhythm guitar and has been compared to [...] "Philly Dog", a Mar-Keys song. [...] The verse section is a variation on a blues progression, which uses the beginning eight bars of a twelve-bar blues. [...] The song opens with Hendrix plucking harmonic notes and unlike most of his songs, he uses a standard tuning for the guitar. [...] Guitarist Jeff Beck, who considers [...] "Stone Free" [...] his favorite Hendrix song, commented, [...] "It's got bits of Buddy Guy; it sounds like Les Paul in places. [...] Jimi does every trick in the book and nails it all together so tight that you can't <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> joints." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{autobiography}} Sana (1975), Somare lists many anecdotes. He {{tells how}} in 1971, {{he was concerned}} that the sacred objects, the ornately carved sacred spears or kakars and the sacred flutes, were being lost, destroyed, sold or stolen. After much negotiation with the gapars or priests he arranged to have the kakars of his village photographed. The kakars were only handled by the senior gapars, and only left or [...] "came down" [...] from the haus tambaran {{on the occasion of}} the gapars handing over the priestly function to another orob or generation. Somare himself was too young to be allowed to <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> kakars, but was included into the coming down ceremony as the interpreter for the photographer, who was of a suitable age to be attached to the next orob. Only after the ceremony was complete did he realise the significance of the sacrifice made by the older priests to allow these photographs to be taken. Over the following days they completed the initiation of the new orob, thus denying themselves the privilege of serving as gapars ever again (see also Lipset 1997).|$|E
2500|$|Inspiration for the song's lyrics came via the Internet {{generation}} and group members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope raising children. In response to both modern jadedness {{and their children}} experiencing wonders {{of the world for}} the first time, the group wanted to write a song about natural phenomena humans experience in life which often go unacknowledged. The closing lyrics encourage listeners to take time to look at the world and [...] "appreciate the things that life has to offer". According to Violent J, [...] "What's a shame is how people walk around blind to it all. They lost their spirit about everything. If you can’t <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> miracle in animals, then you must have never truly loved a pet." [...] He believes that scientific explanations can sometimes kill the intriguing mysteries of the world, such as how ancient pyramids were made. Violent J admits that the song's lyrics discuss [...] "things [...] may not be actual miracles. They may have scientific facts explaining them [...] But nonetheless, these things are still incredible [...] and they should be appreciated." [...] He added that the group's use of the word 'miracle' was intended to mean [...] "something fuckin’ amazing and incredible, [...] special, awesome event, [...] a great, wonderful thing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Of course, most of {{the credit}} went to Friedkin, who, {{according}} to Rosenblum, [...] "may not have <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> film". Friedkin later admitted to having [...] "no vision" [...] for Minsky's and instead borrowed from Rouben Mamoulian's film Applause (1929), an early talkie about burlesque notable for its innovative camera work.|$|R

2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not <b>even</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E

5000|$|For reasons still unknown, Dream, Interrupted was {{initially}} released in compact disc format {{in various parts}} of the United Kingdom.
