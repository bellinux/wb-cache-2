25|$|The poodle is an active, {{intelligent}} and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, {{the length of}} body measured from the breastbone {{to the point of}} the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.|$|E

Some open β-sheets are very curved and <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> on themselves (as in the SH3 domain) or form horseshoe shapes (as in the ribonuclease inhibitor). Open β-sheets can assemble face-to-face (such as the β-propeller domain or immunoglobulin fold) or edge-to-edge, forming one big β-sheet.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the current}} time, the {{simplest}} treatment for an elevated lipoprotein(a) is niacin, 1-3 grams daily, in general in an extended-release form. Niacin therapy can reduce lipoprotein(a) levels by 20-30%. [...] A more effectve treatment is the Linus Pauling protocol: [...] 6-18 grams/day ascorbic acid, 6 grams/day L-lysine and 2 grams/day L-proline. This protocol can reduce LP(a) 2-5 <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> a few months. Aspirin may be beneficial, as well, but {{has only been}} tested in patients that carry the apolipoprotein(a) gene minor allele variant (rs3798220). [...] A recent meta-analysis suggests that atorvastatin may also lower Lp(a) levels. In severe cases, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, or treatment resistant hypercholesterolemia, lipid apheresis may result in dramatic reductions of lipoprotein(a). The goal of treatment is to reduce levels to below 50nbsp&mg/dL.|$|E

60|$|His {{father had}} left him a full treasury, both money and jewels being in abundance. But the foolish king just {{deceased}} had squandered every penny in riotous living. He had then taxed his subjects until most of them became paupers, and this money vanished in more riotous living. Next he sold all the grand old furniture in the palace; all the silver and gold plate and bric-a-brac; all the rich carpets and furnishings and even his own kingly wardrobe, reserving only a soiled and moth-eaten ermine robe to <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> his threadbare raiment.

60|$|I {{went up to}} {{the quarry}} woods one evening in early April, taking a look for Annable. I could not find him, however, in the wood.

She laid, it in a narrow <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder; he thanked her carelessly, and she watched him sweep languidly across the buttercupped and dandelioned grass of the meadow-land about the house, to the dark shelter of the pine grove at the north. The sun struck full upon the long levels of the boughs, and kindled their needles to a glistening mass; underneath, the ground was red, and through the warm-looking {{twilight}} of the sparse wood the gray canvas of a tent showed; Matt often slept there in the summer, and so the place was called the camp. There was a hammock {{between two of the}} trees, just beyond the low stone wall, and Louise saw Maxwell get into it.|$|E
60|$|And the Rhinoceros did. He buttoned it up {{with the}} three buttons, and it tickled like cake crumbs in bed. Then he wanted to scratch, but that made it worse; and then he lay down on the sands and rolled and rolled and rolled, and every time he rolled the cake crumbs tickled him worse and worse and worse. Then he ran to the palm-tree and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed himself against it. He rubbed so much and so hard that he rubbed his skin into a great <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> his shoulders, and another fold underneath, where the buttons used to be (but he rubbed the buttons off), and he rubbed some more folds over his legs. And it spoiled his temper, but it didn't make the least {{difference}} to the cake-crumbs. They were inside his skin and they tickled. So he went home, very angry indeed and horribly scratchy; and from that day to this every rhinoceros has great folds in his skin and a very bad temper, all on account of the cake-crumbs inside.|$|E
60|$|Herr Winklemann had a mother--as {{old as the}} hills, {{according}} to his own report, and any one who beheld her feeble frame and wrinkled visage might well have believed him. With tender regard for her welfare her stout son had refrained from removing or even alarming her until the last moment, partly from fear that fright and the removal might do her serious injury, and partly from {{the hope that the}} flood had reached its highest point; but when the danger to his dwelling became great he resolved to carry her to the hut of old Liz, and, as a preliminary step, had removed her old arm-chair, as we have seen, to be ready for her reception. On returning to the house, however, he found that a portion of the river bank above had unexpectedly given way, diverging the flood a little in that part, so that his dwelling was already a foot deep in water. The old woman, however, lay safely on the bed where Winklemann had placed her, and was either unconscious of, or indifferent to what was going on. She did indeed look a little surprised when her son wrapped the blanket, on which she lay, completely round her, and took her up in his arms {{as if she had been}} a little child, but the look of surprise melted into a humorous smile as he drew the last <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> her face. She clearly believed it to be one of her dear boy's little practical jokes, and submitted without a murmur.|$|E

60|$|Description. The {{number of}} valves in the {{capitulum}} has in this genus acquired its maximum. The number varies considerably in the same species, and even {{on opposite sides of}} the same individual, and generally increases with age. It is more important, that the number of the whorls in P. cornucopia, and in the two following closely-allied forms, also increases with age. In P. sertus and P. spinosus, even the number of the whorls varies in different individuals, independently of age. The valves are arranged alternately with those above and below; they are generally thick and strong, making the capitulum somewhat massive; in some species they are subject to much disintegration; but in others, the apices of the several valves, especially of the carina and rostrum, are well preserved, and project freely: they are covered with membrane, which, differently from in most species of Scalpellum, either does not bear any spines, or only exceedingly minute points. In all the species there is a sub-rostrum and sub-carina, and often beneath these a second sub-rostrum and sub-carina. In medium-sized specimens there are at least 20 valves in the lowermost whorl. The carina is either straight or curved, but never rectangularly bent, and is always of considerable breadth. None of the valves are added to at their upper ends. The scuta have a deep pit for the adductor muscle. The valves lie either some little way apart, or more commonly close together. In P. mitella the scuta and terga are locked together by a fold, and the valves of the lower whorl overlap each other in a peculiar manner, resembling that in which the compartments in the shells of Sessile Cirripedes <b>fold</b> <b>over</b> each other.|$|E
