5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the story, Saya finds Kohta cringing in the hallway as students run about in a panic. They hide in a classroom where Hirano is able to put together a nail gun rifle powered by gas cartridges. Kohta has an unrequited crush on Saya. Kohta provides long-range cover when Takashi rescues Alice Maresato from approaching zombies after Alice's father is killed. At Saya's mansion, Kohta is confronted by some of Takagi's followers who demand that he surrender his weapons, but Kohta refuses saying this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he was good at and that he wants to protect Saya. The rest of the group, including Saya, support him.|$|E
2500|$|... "Is Williams' {{redemption}} {{complete and}} sincere, {{or is it}} just a hollow promise? Stanley Williams insists he is innocent, and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case. Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings there can be no redemption. In this case, the one thing that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Williams will not do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Help it! Did you try? It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> you <b>were</b> sure o' yoursel'; it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{you thought}} worth anybody's learning. You stood before her crowing the whole day. I said the now I wished {{you would go}} and leave her wi' me: but I wouldna dare to keep her; she's {{helpless}} without you; if you took your arm awa frae her now, she would tumble to the ground." ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{calculated}} to rouse Red Gilbat. He seemed to flare, to bristle, and he paced for the bleachers.|$|R

2500|$|According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is {{the sole}} reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an {{important}} question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by maya (constantly changing reality) and avidya ("ignorance"). Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, [...] "Absolute Truth", and [...] "the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (sat), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that is not sublatable".|$|E
2500|$|Drea de Matteo as Joey's {{attractive}} {{older sister}} Gina Tribbiani, who is temperamental and promiscuous. Not particularly bright but very street-wise, Gina is a caring but over-protective and domineering mother. For years she convinced her genius son Michael {{that he was}} born when she was 22 instead of 16 years old, and always says he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> she has done well. She and Joey are friends {{in addition to being}} siblings, both having the gift of being extremely appealing to the opposite sex, with numerous lovers. Initially working as a hairdresser, by season two she works as a secretary for Joey's agent Bobbie, having impressed Bobbie with her brash manner. In season two she starts dating Michael's father Jimmy once again. In the Season 2 episode [...] "Joey and the Holding Hands", it is implied that Gina may be bisexual.|$|E
2500|$|His private prayer diaries, {{like those}} of Samuel Johnson, express a {{profound}} contemplative (though more ecumenical) Christian view {{of the importance of}} humility in seeking divine assistance with his career. [...] "A life, the life of Christ," [...] Deakin wrote, [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> needful—the only revelation required is there.... We have but to live it." [...] In 1888, as an example relevant to his work for Federation, Deakin prayed: [...] "Oh God, grant me that judgment & forsight which will enable me to serve my country—guide me and strengthen me, so that I may follow & persuade others to follow the path which shall lead to the elevation of national life & thought & permanence of well earned prosperity—give me light & truth & influence for the highest & the highest only." [...] As Walter Murdoch pointed out, [...] " [...] believed himself to be inspired, and to have a divine message and mission." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he had planned. He {{was delighted}} {{that it seemed}} to be a {{perfectly}} well bred and Washingtonian thing to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't {{supposed}} to lead anywhere, is it?" [...] said Dorothy, satirically. [...] "I thought it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>is</b> {{an end in}} itself." ...|$|R
60|$|Secrecy {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that can make}} modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. <b>The</b> commonest thing <b>is</b> {{delightful}} if one only hides it.|$|R
2500|$|Silverstone {{continued}} her theatre work, next appearing in David Mamet's Boston Marriage (2007), a play exploring {{the relationship between}} two upper-class women, where the actress played what was described by Los Angeles Times as the [...] "clueless and hyper-emotional Scottish maid" [...] of one of them. The production {{was presented at the}} Geffen Playhouse theater in Los Angeles, with Variety writing that Silverstone [...] "steals the show [...] Her Scottish accent is good, her comic delivery is fresh, and she gets the maximum laugh value from each wobbly curtsey. Her character <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the show that Mamet gets absolutely right, although she is used a bit repetitively." [...] In the same year, she starred as a secretary in the theater production Speed-the-Plow, a satire on Hollywood executives and their monetary decisions. The production, presented at Geffen Playhouse, was directed by Randall Arney and penned by David Mamet. The Hollywood Reporter concluded the play was [...] "fueled" [...] by [...] "a spectacular tour de force" [...] from Silverstone.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said {{would not be a}} great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} shall," [...] said Mr. Bennett decidedly. [...] "Music of {{that description}} happens to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which jars unendurably on my nerves. My nervous system is thoroughly out of tune." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} speak, but {{his lips were}} as {{powerless}} to frame words as his limbs were to respond to his desire for movement. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which he had not foreseen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} full of {{something}} very bad if I were to allow myself {{to stand at the}} altar with him. Drop it, Uncle Indefer. Get it out of your mind as a thing quite impossible. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I can't and won't do, even for you. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that you ought not to ask me to do. Do as you like with the property,--as you think right." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{they mean}} must {{depend on what}} the kingdom of God means; for that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about which they speak.|$|E

6000|$|Then I sank--knew 'twas quite a foredone thing [...] That misery should <b>be</b> To <b>the</b> end! [...] . To get freed of {{her there}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> [...] Had made the change welcome to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, admitted. The {{unexpected}} always moves me so. I {{have found}} you {{many things in}} the course of our acquaintance. To-night you <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I never expected to find you: an honest man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so they shall. I'm {{glad to see}} him, poor motherless thing!" [...] And {{the loving}} attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, indeed. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in {{life where}} one may choose safest what one likes best; I mean {{if there is}} nothing bad in the man himself." ...|$|E

60|$|LADY (wringing her hands). Oh, how I wish I {{really had}} told you some lie! You would have {{believed}} me then. The truth <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that nobody will believe.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he's too clever {{for you and}} Mr. Harris," [...] she said, [...] "I can't help that. I {{only know}} that he came on board. My eyes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in life I do believe." ...|$|R
60|$|Edricson came, however, of that sturdy Saxon blood {{which is}} very slowly heated, but once up not easily to <b>be</b> cooled. <b>The</b> hint of danger which Norbury threw out <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> needed to harden his resolution.|$|R
60|$|This short flight <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{needed to}} reveal the seeming mystery; for as Jim leaped into the main rigging with the {{intention}} of going aloft, if <b>the</b> ghostly voice <b>was</b> heard again, he involuntarily glanced downward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only," [...] he said, [...] "{{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I desire, {{although it}} is the one return you can make me----. But whatever I have done--I have done willingly...." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Bud,' says he, in a pained style, 'that child <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I {{have to live}} for. She may go; but the boy is mine!--think of it--I have cus-to-dy of the child.' ...|$|E
60|$|Frightened {{though he}} was, Dick knew water <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> his father most needed; and laying the poor head gently {{back on the}} sand, he took the canteen from a bag which had served instead of a saddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed!" [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "that {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he cannot do. He can do {{everything}} but come here. And are we to tell nobody that he has arrived in France?--not even that much?" ...|$|R
