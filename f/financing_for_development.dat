25|$|The year 2015 has {{marked a}} number of {{significant}} milestones, such as the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which was the focus of the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW59) from 9–20 March 2015, where global leaders took stock of progress and remaining challenges for implementing this landmark agreement for gender equality and women's rights. UN Women played an active role in major intergovernmental negotiations and processes including the <b>Financing</b> <b>for</b> <b>Development</b> Conference in Addis Ababa in July 2015, the outcome of which was strong on the need to adequately fund gender equality and incorporate it in development planning, as well as the negotiations and successful adoption of the new post-2015 development agenda on 25 September 2015. The new global development roadmap includes a stand-alone goal on gender equality and women's empowerment (Sustainable Development Goal 5), and mainstreams these priorities throughout all 17 goals.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the {{expectation}} that the earnings of the state firms would provide {{an important source of}} public <b>financing</b> <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> these companies became almost immediately a collective drain. In some measure, the drain was a result of decisions by the government to hold down their prices in order to lessen inflation or to subsidize consumers. In addition, deficits of the state-owned firms were aggravated by the spending tendencies of the military officers placed in charge of company management and by inadequate attention to costs of production. The collective deficits of the state enterprises plus the subsidies paid directly to them by the government reached 3 percent of GDP by 1975. State enterprises were not able to finance more than about one-fourth of their investment spending. The government attempted to answer the investment requirements of the state firms by allowing them to borrow abroad for imported equipment and supplies. They did so on a large scale. The external debt rose swiftly, for this and for other reasons discussed below.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} finance and development suggests that countries with better developed financial systems experience faster {{economic growth and}} enjoy lower levels of poverty and income inequality.

This paper argues that the governments {{play an important role}} in building effective and inclusive financial systems and discusses policies to make <b>finance</b> work <b>for</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R
