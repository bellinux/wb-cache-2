The magnitude of the flow rate to voltage relationship is demonstrated to be sensitive to many different geometric parameters.

By a Finite Element Method simulation of the assumed <b>electrostatic</b> <b>process</b> the analysis is further extended to include all geometric parameters. The results outlined show the change of flow rate with applied voltage in cone-jet mode electrospray can be significant.

However, {{little is}} known regarding their localisation and composition in the bran layers of the kernel. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the distribution of phytosterols and steryl ferulates in the wheat grain and in the different layers of bran. The wheat fractions, produced by conventional debranning, aleurone separation and a novel <b>electrostatic</b> <b>process,</b> were analysed for phytosterol contents using GC-FID and for steryl ferulate contents using HPLC-UV. The compounds were identified by GC- and LC-MS. Phytosterols and steryl ferulates were concentrated in the bran layers. The steryl ferulates were accumulated in the intermediate layers, whereas the phytosterols were more evenly distributed in the intermediate layers and aleurone cell contents. The phytosterol composition varied within the wheat kernel, while the steryl ferulate composition was similar in different fractions. Sitosterol and campestanyl ferulate were the main compounds. The highest levels of phytosterols (up to 2117 mu g/g) and steryl ferulates (up to 703 mu g) were found in the pearling, aleurone and certain bran fractions. The phytosterol-rich fractions could be utilised in cereal foods to enhance the intake of health-promoting compounds from natural sources. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

A novel, absorbable-coating sirolimus-eluting stent (AC-SES) was evaluated for its capacity to deliver drug more evenly within the intimal area rather than concentrating drug around the stent struts and for its ability to match coating erosion with drug release. The coating consisted of absorbable poly-lactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and crystalline sirolimus deposited by a dry-powder <b>electrostatic</b> <b>process.</b> The AC-SES demonstrated enhanced drug stability under simulated use conditions and consistent drug delivery balanced with coating erosion in a porcine coronary implant model. The initial drug burst was eliminated and drug release was sustained after implantation. The coating was absorbed within 90 days. Following implantation into porcine coronary arteries the AC-SES coating is distributed in the surrounding intimal tissue {{over the course of several}} weeks. Computational modeling of drug delivery characteristics demonstrates how distributed coating optimizes the load of drug immediately around each stent strut and extends drug delivery between stent struts. The result was a highly efficient arterial uptake of drug with superior performance to a clinical bare metal stent (BMS). Neointimal thickness (0. 17 ± 0. 07 mm vs. 0. 28 ± 0. 11 mm) and area percent stenosis (22 ± 9 % vs. 35 ± 12 %) were significantly reduced (p< 0. 05) by the AC-SES compared to the BMS 30 days after stent implantation in an overlap configuration in porcine coronary arteries. Inflammation was significantly reduced in the AC-SES compared to the BMS at both 30 and 90 days after implantation.

40|$|Paschen's Law as {{illustrated}} by Paschen curves for various gases shows that the minimum breakdown voltage for gases for breakdown distances of interest, i. e., 1 to 1000 mm is {{at or near the}} surface pressure on Mars. This means that the physics of many <b>electrostatic</b> <b>processes</b> is markedly different on Mars than on Earth. The primary effect is that voltage potentials above 100 volts are subject to breakdown in the Martian atmosphere. Sharp electrodes, dusty atmospheric conditions, or other anomalies modify the breakdown voltage, usually causing lower breakdown voltages. Paschen's curves for most common pure gases were experimentally determined. A very small amount of mixing of different gases radically changes the curve as shown in the curve for neon plus 0. 1 percent argon compared to either neon or argon. Paschen's curve for the exact composition of gases for Mars was not determined; thus, the breakdown voltages are not known.

Here we report on impedance measurements over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz of α-β tubulin heterodimers suspended in a buffer. These and other polyelectrolyte suspensions show enormous dielectric responses at low frequencies, due both to the motion of charges suspended in the medium and to an electrical double layer that forms at each electrode-medium interface. We propose an equivalent circuit model to minimize electrode polarization effects and extract the intrinsic response of the bulk medium. At megaHertz frequencies, the conductivity increases with concentration below the critical concentration of ∼ 1 mg/ml for microtubule polymerization, above which the conductivity decreases. This suggests that such measurements {{can be used to}} monitor the dynamics of microtubule polymerization. Finally, we obtain the net charge number per tubulin dimer of |Z|= 306 in the saline buffer, which, if maintained as the dimers polymerized, would yield a linear charge density of 3. 8 e/Å for the assembled microtubules.

40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} experiments {{have demonstrated that}} electrostatic charges generated during the fragmentation of volcanic pumice cause rapid aggregation of the silicate particles produced. Here, we present measurements of the mass and component particle size distribution of individual, electrostatically bound aggregates produced during these experiments. Particles produced by fracturing pumice aggregated as they fell ∼ 1. 5 m within an enclosed fall chamber. Aggregate mass measurements indicate aggregate densities of ∼ 200 kg m− 3 or less. The component particle size analysis demonstrates exponential-type cumulative distributions which are dominated (on a volume basis) by particles ∼ 10 – 40 μm in diameter and contain few particles > 70 μm. By representing these particles as disks of 5 μm thickness the calculated aggregate densities are in agreement with those derived from the aggregate mass measurements and indicate a relatively constant aggregate density with size (in contrast with previous results from fall velocities). Combining the density measurements with fall velocity data allows the drag coefficient of aggregates to be determined.
