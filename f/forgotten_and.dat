5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E

5|$|In the epilogue, Shiva retires to Mount Kailash {{where he}} lives {{the rest of his}} days peacefully, though missing Sati every day. Ganesh, Kali and Kartik become renowned as Gods for their prowess, all over India. They take revenge for Sati's death by wiping out the whole clan of the Egyptian assassins. Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed that {{in order to ensure that}} the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at a point where the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> were viewed as powerful ancestors.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave was <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and others of the family.|$|E

5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been <b>forgotten,</b> <b>and</b> the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely <b>forgotten,</b> <b>and</b> there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E

5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be <b>forgotten,</b> <b>and</b> that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E
5|$|McDowall fined Revie £27 {{for missing}} {{two weeks of}} {{training}} for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie {{for much of the}} 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not <b>forgotten,</b> <b>and</b> he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Confederation in 1867, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom {{served in}} Canada as {{the symbol of}} royal authority. Arms had not been granted {{to any of the}} colonies in British North America, apart from 17th-century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The year after Confederation, arms were granted by Royal Warrant on May 26, 1868 to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia (that Nova Scotia had been granted arms was <b>forgotten,</b> <b>and</b> it took until 1929 for the {{historic}} arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated) and New Brunswick. In the Royal Warrant of 1868, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and while this was not done for the first Great Seal, it is through this reference it became the de facto arms for Canada until 1921. That is why it was in this form Canada was represented on the first Red Ensign carried by Canadian troops at Vimy Ridge in 1917.|$|E

5|$|The 2016 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active, costliest, and deadliest {{hurricane season}} since 2012. The season officially started on June1 and ended on November30, though the first storm, Hurricane Alex which formed in the Northeastern Atlantic, developed on January12, being the first hurricane to develop in January since 1938. The final storm, Otto, crossed into the Eastern Pacific on November25, {{a few days before}} the official end. Following Alex, Tropical Storm Bonnie brought flooding to South Carolina and portions of North Carolina. Tropical Storm Colin in early June brought minor flooding and wind damage to parts of the Southeastern United States, especially Florida. Hurricane Earl left 94fatalities in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, 81of which occurred in the latter. In early September, Hurricane Hermine, the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, brought extensive coastal flooding damage especially to the <b>Forgotten</b> <b>and</b> Nature coasts of Florida. Hermine was responsible for five fatalities and about $550million (2016USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{area of the}} Theban hills {{is subject}} to {{infrequent}} violent thunder storms, causing flash floods in the valley. Recent {{studies have shown that}} there are at least seven active flood stream beds leading down into the central area of the valley. This central area appears to have been flooded {{at the end of the}} Eighteenth Dynasty, with several tombs buried under metres of debris. The tombs KV63, KV62, and KV55 are dug into the actual wadi bedrock rather than the debris, showing that the level of the valley was five meters below its present level. After this event later dynasties leveled the floor of the valley, making the floods deposit their load further down the valley, and the buried tombs were <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> only discovered in the early 20th century. This was the area that was the subject of the Amarna Royal Tombs Project ground scanning radar investigation, which showed several anomalies, one of which was proved to be KV63.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long <b>forgotten</b> <b>and</b> whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
