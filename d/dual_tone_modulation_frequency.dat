In one condition, the modulating waveform was a low-frequency sinusoid (SAM tone).

Many individual neurons exhibited strong selectivity for modulator type. Neurons with pauser discharge patterns to steady-state tones usually exhibited greater responsiveness to SAM tones than to TRAM. In contrast, neurons that responded transiently to steady-state tones usually exhibited greater responsiveness to TRAM tones than to SAM. Neurons with sustained responses to steady-state tones responded strongly to both types of modulated tones. The selectivity for modulator type suggests that transient neurons may play a different functional role in the representation of envelopes than do other types of neurons...|$|R
40|$|The lateral {{superior}} olive (LSO) is a brainstem nucleus that is classically {{understood to}} encode binaural information in high-frequency sounds. Previous {{studies have shown}} that LSO cells are sensitive to envelope interaural time difference in sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) tones (Joris and Yin, J Neurophysiol 73 : 1043 – 1062, 1995; Joris, J Neurophysiol 76 : 2137 – 2156, 1996) and that a subpopulation of LSO neurons exhibit low-threshold potassium currents mediated by Kv 1 channels (Barnes-Davies et al., Eur J Neurosci 19 : 325 – 333, 2004). It has also been shown that in many LSO cells the average response rate to ipsilateral SAM <b>tones</b> decreases with <b>modulation</b> <b>frequency</b> above a few hundred Hertz (Joris and Yin, J Neurophysiol 79 : 253 – 269, 1998).

The mechanisms explored included the effects of after-hyperpolarization (AHP) channels, the dynamics of low-threshold potassium channels (KLT), and the effects of background inhibition. In the model, AHP channels alone were not sufficient to induce the observed rate decrease at high <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The model also suggests that the background inhibition alone, possibly from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, can account for the small rate decrease seen in some LSO neurons, but could not explain the larg...|$|R
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} of age-related changes in auditory processing {{in the central}} auditory system is limited, unlike {{the changes in the}} peripheral hearing organs which are more extensively studied. These changes in the central auditory pathway primarily manifest as changes in processing of temporally complex stimuli. This study aims to understand age-related changes in temporal processing in a rodent model system using non-invasive auditory evoked potentials and comparing these to single neuron responses from the inferior colliculus (IC), a primary generator of these responses. ^ Envelope following responses (EFRs) were recorded from young and aged Fischer- 344 rats using subdermal needle electrodes, and dual channels in anesthetized and un-anesthetized conditions. The stimuli used to evoke these responses were sinusoidally amplitude <b>tones</b> changing in <b>modulation</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>modulation</b> depth, envelope shape and sound level of presentation, as well as sinusoidally frequency modulated tones. Single neuron responses from the IC of these young and aged animals were recorded for the same stimuli and differences in rate and temporal discharge coding were investigated. ^ The evoked potentials indicate that responses to these stimuli are similar between the young and aged animals for slower <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> and higher <b>modulation</b> depths. However, significant deficits began to emerge with age when the modulation cues were reduced or altered, even when changes in hearing sensitivity were compensated. Aged animals exhibit decreased response amplitudes with faster <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> and decreased <b>modulation</b> depths. Dual channel recordings indicate that the two channels are sensitive to a complementary range of <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and provide a greater understanding of these age-related deficits. Responses from IC neurons correlate with these changes, exhibiting lower cutoff frequencies and higher depth thresholds in synchronous responses with age. ^ These results indicate that age related temporal processing deficits become apparent only under difficult listening conditions, and standard diagnostic testing methods in quiet may not be sufficient for fully understanding age-related hearing changes that could affect quality of life. This work also has implications for constraining the responsible cellular and network mechanisms as well as rapid testing of therapeutic interventions including auditory training or pharmacological treatments. ...|$|R

However, there is no known mechanism explaining the anti-proliferative effect of very low intensity electromagnetic fields. METHODS: To understand the mechanism of this novel approach, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were exposed to 27. 12 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields using in vitro exposure systems designed to replicate in vivo conditions. Cancer cells were exposed to tumour-specific <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies,</b> previously identified by biofeedback methods in patients with a diagnosis of cancer. Control <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> consisted of randomly chosen <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> within the same 100 Hz- 21 kHz range as cancer-specific frequencies. RESULTS: The growth of HCC and breast cancer cells was significantly decreased by HCC-specific and breast cancer-specific <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies,</b> respectively. However, the same frequencies did not affect proliferation of nonmalignant hepatocytes or breast epithelial cells. Inhibition of HCC cell proliferation was associated with downregulation of XCL 2 and PLP 2. Furthermore, HCC-specific <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> disrupted the mitotic spindle. CONCLUSION: These findings uncover a novel mechanism controlling the growth of cancer cells at specific <b>modulation</b> <b>frequencies</b> without affecting normal tissues, which may have broad implications in oncology.
