5000|$|There {{have been}} {{fisheries}} and fishing {{activity in the}} Mediterranean throughout recorded history. The 18 fish species most commercially important in Roman times were species of the Scombridae family, such as thunny, as well as sturgeon, gray mullet, red mullet, hake, <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and moray. The artisanal fishing methods mentioned in Roman literature remain much the same today. Aristotle, Pliny, Oppian, Varro, Columella, Aelian, Atenaeus, Macrobius, Martial, Ovid and Strabo all attest to an interest in fish and fishing in Roman times.he first attempt to establish a fishing industry after the First World War and early 1919 was {{by a group of}} Ahdut Ha'avoda members. The [...] "Pinsk fishermen" [...] arrived in 1922 as a group from the town of Brest. The Shalom Ashkenazi family from Salonika in Greece constituted an independent and successful fishing group. In late 1932, a maritime service company was established, followed by Jewish shipping companies in 1934-1935 such as Lloyd shipping. [...] In 1936, the Jewish Agency established the Department of Fisheries headed by Bar-Kochba Meirovitch. In 1937, Captain Gustav Fitch was sent on behalf of [...] "Gordonia" [...] to Israel to survey the possibilities for a fishing industry on the coasts of Nahariya and Atlit. Kibbutz Neve Yam engaged in coastal fishing from boats they built themselves. Kibbutz Mishmar Krayot near Haifa Bay engaged in trawl fishing. The only ship of Kibbutz Galil Yam sank off the coast of Ashkelon. When the state was established, the entire Jewish fishing fleet on the Mediterranean consisted of four ships.|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of pseudomonads in <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> Mediterranean fish (Sparus aurata) stored under different conditions were studied. Phenotypic analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell proteins {{were performed to}} identify a total of 106 Pseudomonas strains isolated from S. aurata stored under different temperatures (at 0, 10, and 20 °C) and packaging conditions (air and a modified atmosphere of 40 % CO 2 - 30 % N 2 - 30 % O 2). Pseudomonas lundensis was the predominant species, followed by Pseudomonas fluorescens, while Pseudomonas fragi and Pseudomonas putida were detected less frequently. Fluorescent Pseudomonas strains dominated under air conditions, while proteolytic and less lipolytic strains dominated under modified-atmosphere packaging.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a better {{understanding}} of organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> aquaculture production in Greece, in particular its consequences for fish growth, health and body composition, and to propose and update standards for sustainable organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> farming. Gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were kept in sea cages at densities of 4 kg m (3) (organic) and 15 kg m (3) (conventional), and were fed organically produced feed (45 % crude protein, 14 % fat) or conventional feed (46 % crude protein, 17 % fat). The amino acid profile of the conventional diet, particularly the lysine content, which is one of most important dietary amino acids for <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> appeared to be unsatisfactory. "Organic" <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> stored less fat content in their white muscle than the conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The liver lipid content was lower and the hepatosomatic index was higher for the organic <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The microbiological analysis showed that both Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli on the skin were below the enumeration detection limit in both the organic and conventional <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Total viable counts on the skin and muscle of both the organically and conventionally cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were approximately 3 log cfu g(- 1), which is well below the acceptable limit (7 log cfu g(- 1)) for marine species. The results showed that the combination of a low stocking density and feed with a different ingredient composition but similar nutritional value resulted in similar growth rates and nutrient profiles of the final product.

40|$|Cultured {{and wild}} <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were {{compared}} {{for differences in}} their volatile components over a 23 day storage period in ice. A total of 60 compounds in cultured and 78 compounds in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were tentatively identified (in addition to this, there were 23 unknowns in cultured and 29 unknowns in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> volatiles). These included aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, aromatics, terpenes, furans, sulfur-containing compounds, an acid, and miscellaneous compounds. Although selection of best fish is a subjective matter, more aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, and terpenes were found in wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> as {{compared to that of}} its cultured counterpart. Both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> samples exhibited complex volatile profiles over the entire storage period. The combination of several classes of volatile compounds, dependent upon their concentrations and odor thresholds, is responsible for the distinctive and unique flavor of fresh cultured and wild <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Relative concentrations of several compounds (trimethylamine, piperidine, methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, 1 -penten- 3 -ol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, and acetic acid) increased continually throughout the storage period, and these may have the potential to be used as indicators of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> quality.

The aim of the present work was to compare the nutritional value of fatty acids in the flesh of wild sea bass and <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Significant differences were observed in the saturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acid content. The presence of lauric, myristic and palmitic acids in the flesh of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in quantities far exceeding those in sea bass make <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> less suitable for preventing cardiovascular diseases. The poly-unsaturated n- 3 fatty acids with both anti-atherogenetic and anti-inflammatory action in sea bass surpass those of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> by a total of 30 %. Sea bass also contains 60 % more C 22 : 6 n- 3.

TVBN showed a slow and uniform increase. The catabolism of adenine nucleotides showed a slow rate of inosine monophosphate decomposition and a small linear rate of hypoxanthine accumulation. The K value of summer fish was found to be initially higher than that of fish sampled in winter in the early stages of storage, but lower in the later stages when microbial spoilage occurred. These results indicate that summer fish have higher rates of autolytic activity but lower rates of microbial spoilage. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of adhesion of Vibrio strains {{isolated from}} diseased fish to skin mucus of <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> was studied.

The adhesive capability for skin mucus {{does not seem to}} be an essential virulence factor of pathogenic strains of Vibrio, since this specific interaction depended on several environmental factors, temperature and salinity being the most important. However, the absence of an inhibitory effect of mucus on the pathogenic microorganisms, and the capability of the Vibrio strains to utilize mucus as a carbon source, could favor their settlement on the skin with a potential for infection of cultured, stressed fish...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo and {{in vitro}} {{pathogenic}} activities of whole cells and extracellular products of Vibrio alginolyticus for cultured <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were evaluated.

In addition, the in vitro ability of V. alginolyticus to adhere to mucus and skin cells of sea bream was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. The biological activities of extracellular products of V. alginolyticus were hydrolytic activities; the products were able to degrade sea bream mucus. V. alginolyticus was cytotoxic for fish cell lines and lethal for sea bream. Moreover, the extracellular products could degrade sea bream tissues. However, experiments performed with the bath immersion inoculation technique demonstrated that V. alginolyticus should be considered a pathogen for sea bream only when the mucus layer is removed and the skin is damaged...|$|E

40|$|With {{average annual}} growth at 38 %, <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> {{production}} is the main growth factor in Israel's fish- eries industry. It is estimated that cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> constituted over 10 % of the volume and 20 % {{of the value of}} domestic fisheries in 2000. Per capita consumption of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> grew from 0. 11 kg in 1995 to an estimated 0. 39 kg in 2000. Rapid industry development lowered market prices but, in general, farm-gate prices in Israel are higher than in major Mediterranean producers. Fluctuations in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> prices reflect fluctuating demand, but the percentage that sales have increased is greater than the percentage that prices have decreased. Cultured <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in Israel lacks competition from wild or imported sources. Increasing supplies of <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> will come from the local mariculture industry, but growth is slowing and several constraints must be overcome. Intensive recirculating aquaculture systems may enhance inland marine farm production. The <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> market in Israel has not reached saturation level, as indicated by consumption which has increased without signifi- cant marketing efforts.

40|$|AbstractAs {{foreign markets}} {{tend to be}} more diverse and competitive, export {{performance}} of fisheries exporting sector has been gaining increasing attention by policy makers, business managers and marketing researchers. Consequently, the aim of this paper is the investigation of export performance and competitiveness in fisheries sector among Balkan and Eastern European countries. Using Eurostat data, the export trade is described for each country, regarding exports of fisheries products in the market of EU - 27. In specific, Greece presents a significant export trade in fresh or chilled <b>Gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> while Bulgaria in frozen sprats and snails (live, fresh, chilled, frozen, salted dried with or no shell). Czech Republic exports mainly live carp, while Hungary portrays a significant export trade in live freshwater fish. Finally, Poland shows a significant export trade in smoked fillets of pacific salmon, while Slovenia in fresh or chilled fillets of freshwater fish. The estimated Revealed Competitive Advantage (RCA) indices reveal a wide range of competitiveness among the countries examined. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} could help policy makers to probably reallocate the natural resources, reinforcing the national production activities in those species and potentially to develop a national strategic plan for the export marketing of the fisheries products involved...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{consumption}} {{preferences are}} affected by individuals&# 8217; socioeconomic characteristics. The aims of the present paper were (i) to obtain information on fish consumption level and frequency; (ii) to investigate the associations between the socioeconomic characteristics of consumers and their preferences; and (iii) to examine the influence of determinants on fish consumption. Data were gathered through a questionnaire completed {{by a total of}} 127 randomly selected individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds from the Antakya, Turkey. The average consumption was found to be 2. 98 kg/person/year for fish. Anchovies, <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> and sea bass were reported as the most consumed three species, respectively. Significant differences in fish consumption were found among age groups, gender groups, and education groups, as well as between marital statuses. A majority of the consumers eat fish once a month throughout the year or only during the winter months. Fish consumption level and frequency were significantly positively correlated with education (p< 0. 01), income (p< 0. 05) and total meat consumption (p< 0. 01). The stepwise multiple regression model explained 41. 7 % (p< 0. 01) of the total variance for fish consumption. The amount and frequency of the consumption in the region, which is very far below the world and Turkey average especially for lower socioeconomic groups and for less-consumed fish species, can be increased by certain policies, such as training, advertising and different marketing strategies. Moreover, consumption should be distributed equally throughout the year instead of consuming only in certain seasons...|$|E
40|$|Ocean {{warming is}} known to alter the {{performance}} and fitness of marine organisms albeit the proteome underpinnings of species thermal tolerance are still largely unknown. In this 1 -month experiment we assessed {{the vulnerability of the}} <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> Sparus aurata, taken here as a biological model for some key fisheries species, to ocean warming (control 18 °C, nursery ground temperature 24 °C and heat wave 30 °C). Survival was impaired after 28 days, mainly at 30 °C although fishes' condition was unaltered. Muscle proteome modulation was assessed at 14 and 21 days, showing that protein expression profiles were similar between fish exposed to 18 and 24 °C, differing from fish exposed to 30 °C. Fish subjected to 24 °C showed an enhanced glycolytic potential and decreased glycogenolysis mainly at 14 days of exposure. Fish subjected to 30 °C also showed enhanced glycolytic potential and up-regulated proteins related to gene expression, cellular stress response (CSR), and homeostasis (mostly cytoskeletal dynamics, acid-base balance, chaperoning). However, inflammatory processes were elicited at 21 days along with a down-regulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, juvenile fish seem able to acclimate to 24 °C but possibly not to 30 °C, which is the predicted temperature for estuaries during heat waves by the year 2100. This may be related with increasing constraints on organism physiology associated with metabolic scope available for performance and fitness at higher temperatures. Consequently, recruitment of commercial sea breams may be in jeopardy, highlighting the need for improved management plans for fish stocks...|$|E
40|$|The {{carotenoids}} in the <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> Chrysophrys major Temminck and Schlegel {{and the red}} <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> Evynnis japonica Tanaka, {{have been}} separated by absorption chromatography, characterized by absorption spectra, co-chromatography with authentic samples and the behavior on the columns. The reactions for specific functional groups were also performed. In the integuments of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin was confirmed. In the internal organs β-carotene, echinenone, lutein, zeaxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin were found. In the integuments of the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-cryptoxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene, lutein (trace), zeaxanthin, 3 -hydroxycanthaxanthin and astaxanthin were clarified. In the internal organs, canthaxnthin, lutein, astaxanthin and P_E- 518 were found. The carotenoids in the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> were compared, and the most conspicuous differences among them, the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains lutein besides astaxanthin in the integuments, on the contrary, the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> contains the traces. It is very interesting that the bright red color of the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> comes from the mixture of astaxanthin (red color), lutein (yellow) and α-doradexanthin (trace). It was confirmed that the <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and the red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> could not convert β-carotene to astaxanthin by feeding β-carotene- 15, 15 '-^ 3 H_ 2, but they could transfer astaxanthin in the diet to their body astaxanthin. The carotenoids in Kinmedai, Beryx splendes Lowe, Amadai, Branchiostegus japonicus, and Akahana, Cephalopholis aurantius, were also extracted, isolated and the metabolic pathway from plant carotenoids to astaxanthin was proposed. When the results and those of previous studies are taken together, consistent patterns are seen. Thus aquatic animals are divided into three classes {{on the basis of}} where astaxanthin is biosynthesized as follows : 1. Prawn-Form, 2. Sea bream-Form, 3. Red carp-Form. Prawn-Form ― The aquatic animals, which belong to this group, can convert β-carotene to their body astaxanthin. Almost all crustacea which contain astaxanthin in their body belong to this group. Prawn, lobster and crab belong to this group. Sea bream-Form ― Can not convert β-carotene, lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, and can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals are carnivorous, and half digested crustacea were found in their stomach. <b>Sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Madai), red <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Chidai), Amadai, Kinmedai and Akahana belong to this group. Red carp-Form ― Can convert lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, but β-carotene is not the major precursor of astaxanthin. They can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals contain α-doradexanthin. Gold fish, red carp, fancy red carp, yellow-golden carp, and Benibuna belong to this group...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in turbot and especially in halibut, but not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Vitamin E improved growth in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> fed oxidised oil but not in turbot or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> or turbot. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> and turbot, but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in turbot and, especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in turbot and <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to turbot and especially <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either turbot or <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R
40|$|Gilthead <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> from {{different}} Mediterranean hatcheries show a consistent number of skeletal anomalies, {{mainly in the}} hemal and caudal body regions. Four hundred and twenty-two hatchery-reared <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> from Italy, France and Spain were checked for skeletal malformations and meristic counts. The same skeletal descriptors were examined in 72 wild-caught <b>sea</b> <b>bream.</b> Correspondence analysis (CA) was performed to rank groups of hatchery-reared <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> according to their skeletal abnormalities. The position of each group on the first correspondence axis {{with respect to the}} wild-caught specimens was used as a larval quality indicator. Wild phenotype similarity was also tested performing meristic counts and inter-groups meristic differences were illustrated. Results highlighted a quality gap between wild-caught and hatchery-reared specimens, with the only exception being <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> larvae that were reared in semi-intensive conditions.

40|$|The {{coastal areas}} of Terracina and Sabaudia were decreed to be {{protected}} environments by Latium Region, {{with the objective of}} promoting the repopulation of the fish. Protection of the areas is guaranteed by special underwater artificial barriers which prevent illegal fishing. The underwater barriers consist of modular units placed on the sea-bottom to protect a total area of about 250. 000 m 2. The structure “atolls” runs parallel to the coastline, forming an artificial protective “reef” that allows many fish species to procreate and develop in a safe ambient. These artificial barriers permit a sustainable sea-culture of high-quality of marine organisms. Appropriate regulations and strategies between cooperative agreements or spin-off enterprise have to be drawn up to ensure a successful management of the project, and the economic benefits to the local population that will derive from this new ecologically sustainable extensive sea-culture of many ichthyic species: Palinurus elephas, Scyllaroides latus, Paeneus and Homarus, Maja squinado, sea anemone, sole, plaice, octopus, <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream,</b> sea bass, base, moray-eel, etc., which will be caught at fixed fishing stations, by underwater fishing or by specific and selective fishing techniques, will be sold with a Certificate of Environmental Origin and Quality, in line with the mission of the protected coastal areas. Correct management of these protected coastal areas will guarantee the success of the project, which is to recreate the fish community of the coastal areas, to save and protect the species involved, and to provide new jobs directly and indirectly to the local population...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} innate immune responses against viruses is mediated by type I IFN. In teleost fish, it is known that virus infection triggers the expression of ifn and many IFN-stimulated genes, but the viral RNA sensors and mediators leading to IFN production are scarcely known. Thus, we have searched for the presence of these genes in <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and evaluated their expression after infection with viral nervous necrosis virus (VNNV) in the brain, the main viral target tissue, and the gonad, used to transmit the virus vertically. In sea bream, a fish species resistant to the VNNV strain used, we found an upregulation of the genes encoding MDA 5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), TBK 1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), IRF 3 (IFN regulatory factor 3), IFN, Mx [myxovirus (influenza) resistance protein] and PKR (dsRNA-dependent protein kinase receptor) proteins in the brain, which were unaltered in the gonad and could favour the dissemination by gonad fluids or gametes. Strikingly, in European sea bass, a very susceptible species, we also identified, transcripts coding for LGP 2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2), MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling), TRAF 3 (TNF receptor-associated factor 3), TANK (TRAF family member-associated NFkappaB activator) and IRF 7 (IFN regulatory factor 7), and found that all the genes analysed were upregulated in the gonad, but only mda 5, lgp 2, irf 3, mx and pkr were upregulated in the brain. These findings supported the notion that the European sea bass brain innate immune response is unable to clear the virus and pointed to the importance of gonad immunity to control the dissemination of VNNV to the progeny - an aspect that is worth investigating in aquatic animals.

40|$|The marine {{environment}} {{represents more than}} two thirds of our planet, however, it is still underexplored. Even still, marine habitats are a promising source of commercially significant biotechnological products. In fact, marine organisms have been recognized as having an important role on the discovery of new bioactive molecules. Among these, sponges exhibit a great diversity of secondary metabolites, which they produce and accumulate. The intention {{in this study was}} to establish the principles of maintenance of sponges in captivity, in order to give them further use. Therefore, the culture potential of the sponge Dysidea fragilis (Demospongiae) was evaluated, with the intent of using them in different areas, such as Biotechnology and Aquaculture. In Biotechnology, they can serve either as source of probiotics, or as source of extracts for the search of compounds with biological activity. The utilities one can give to such organisms are to use their biocompounds as potential probiotics in animal feed, such as for nudibranchs. Both sponges and nudibranchs, are animals much appreciated in aquariophilia, but most difficult to maintain in captivity. In this study, the sponges were collected from the sea bottom in the surrounding areas of Peniche (central western coast of Portugal), by scuba diving. They were sealed in plastic zip bags during transportation to the surface and laboratory, to avoid air contact, which they are not able to endure. They were maintained in a closed water circulation system, transplanted into artificial substrates of plastic and fed every two days, with a mixed solution of microalgae Nanochloropsis salina culture and faeces of <b>gilt-head</b> <b>sea</b> <b>bream</b> (Sparus aurata). As this species is susceptible to the light, half of the tanks of the culture system were protected with a black cloth and the other half were submitted to an acclimation process to this factor, {{in order for them to}} be used in aquariophilia. The sponges dimension and weight were assessed. The establishment of an efficient culture strategy will allow to use sponges as ornamental organism, as well as a diet for other interesting commercial species (also potentially as probiotics), or even as source of extracts for different biotechnology fields...|$|E
