The measured data includes leakage, attitude angle, eccentricity ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping, and inertia. When the floating ring seals are locked up, the eccentricity ratio of the smooth surface <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> is {{lower than that of}} the damper <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds. The damping coefficients of the damper <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> are higher than those of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> Whirl frequency ratios of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> are lower than the damper <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> with high eccentricity ratio at low operating speed range.

BFRS {{which has a}} thickness of bump (0. 076, 0. 1 and 0. 12 mm) are separately tested for pressure-drops of 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0 MPa and rotor-speed up to 24, 800 rpm. The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> When the thickness of bump floating ring seals is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> or small thickness of bump foil. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds in both cases. The direct damping coefficients increase significantly with the increments in bump-foil thickness and hydrostatic pressure-drop, but diminish with the rising rotor-speed. Especially, Coulomb friction damping force between the bump foil and housing surface contributes to the enhancement of direct damping coefficient value. Whirl frequency ratio of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> without bump shows somewhat small in low speed ranges. When bump foil thickness is 0. 074 mm or 0. 1 mm, WFR is insensitive in rotating speed and pressure. But BFRS(0. 12 mm) shows up more stable tendency according to decreasing whirl frequency ratio in high speed ranges. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used to enhance the stability in high pressure and high speed turbomachinery seals...|$|E

40|$|Program {{objectives}} were to determine three advanced configurations of helium buffer seals {{capable of providing}} improved performance in a space shuttle main engine (SSME), high-pressure liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump environment, and to provide NASA with the analytical tools to determine performance {{of a variety of}} seal configurations. The three seal designs included solid-ring fluid-film seals often referred to as <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seals,</b> back-to-back fluid-film face seals, and a circumferential sectored seal that incorporated inherent clearance adjustment capabilities. Of the three seals designed, the sectored seal is favored because the self-adjusting clearance features accommodate the variations in clearance that will occur because of thermal and centrifugal distortions without compromising performance. Moreover, leakage can be contained well below the maximum target values; minimizing leakage is important on the SSME since helium is provided by an external tank. A reduction in tank size translates to an increase in payload that can be carried on board the shuttle.

Development of two types of fluid-film seals for application to advanced LOX turbomachines are summarized. The first is a <b>floating</b> <b>ring,</b> helium buffered <b>seal</b> whose function is to exclude intrusion of liquid oxygen (LOX) into the turbine drive. The other is a spiral groove, LOX, face-type configuration designed to break down pressure and minimize leakage of LOX.

The possibilities of reducing helium storage requirements and thus increasing payload appear promising. A unique configuration of spiral groove LOX seal was required to avoid detrimental vaporization in the flow path.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 157 - 156 In today?s {{business}} environment, {{centrifugal compressor}} reliability is more critical than ever. Unscheduled equipment downtime {{has a negative}} impact on plant operations, oftentimes resulting in a temporary halt of production. In most centrifugal compressor applications, loss of production results in a substantial loss of revenue, sometimes measured in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars per day. This lost revenue has a direct impact on the profitability of the plant. There are tens of thousands of centrifugal compressors currently operating with outdated technology, resulting in increased maintenance costs and reduced reliability. However, product upgrades can improve compressor operation and increase reliability and availability by incorporating the latest technology into existing rotating equipment. The initial investment for these mechanical upgrades is very low in comparison to current operating and maintenance costs and the lost revenue resulting from unscheduled downtime. In most cases, the payback period is measured in months or even weeks.

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearings (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here. The model incorporates a lumped-parameter thermal energy balance for estimation of the lubricant viscosity and thermal growth of the rotor, bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>ring.</b> The FRB model, fully integrated into a non-linear rotordynamics computational program, predicts the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speed, journal and ring eccentricities, power loss and the rotordynamic force coefficients of {{the inner and outer}} films {{as a function of the}} load applied at a given rotor speed. Knowledge of the actual load conditions, static and dynamic, and the changes in operating clearance and effective lubricant viscosity are most important for accurate estimation of a TC dynamic forced response. Predictions for the exit lubricant temperature, power losses and <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speeds agree well with measurements obtained in an automotive turbocharger test rig.
