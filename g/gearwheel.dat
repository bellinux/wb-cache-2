25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal <b>gearwheel</b> called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E
500|$|In {{considering}} the gearing arrangement, Brunel had no precedent {{to serve as}} a guide. The gearing for the Archimedes, of the spur-and-pinion type, had proven almost unbearably noisy, and would not be suitable for a passenger ship. Brunel's solution was to install a chain drive. On the crankshaft between Great Britains two engines, he installed a [...] diameter primary <b>gearwheel,</b> which, by means of a set of four massive inverted-tooth or [...] "silent" [...] chains, operated the smaller secondary gear near the keel, which turned the propeller shaft. This was the first commercial use of silent chain technology, and the individual silent chains installed in Great Britain are thought to have been the largest ever constructed.|$|E

50|$|Gear bearing is {{roller bearing}} {{combining}} to epicyclical gear.

The widths of conjugated rollers and <b>gearwheels</b> in pairs are the same. The engagement is herringbone or with the skew end faces to realize efficient rolling axial contact.

50|$|Sometimes used in clocks, {{the cage}} gear {{should always be}} driven by a <b>gearwheel,</b> not used as the driver. The cage gear was not {{initially}} favoured by conservative clock makers.

50|$|Neglecting {{clearance}} {{and assuming}} perfect accuracy, the engagement of bearing gears {{is aimed at}} maximum rolling with minimum sliding friction of conjugated profiles in movement. End rollers limit the gears radial shift at their contact points {{so that when the}} gears are engaged, slip-free rolling motion of their conjugated pairs is achieved. Adjacent end faces of teeth and rollers limit the axial shift of conjugated bearing gears in plane-parallel motion. In such a way, using bearing gears as sun, ring and more than two satellites uniformly distributed among them the entire gear bearing is arranged, and carrier may be used instead of ring or sun <b>gearwheels,</b> or it may act as a frame unit and transfer rotation from the satellites, whereas limitation of carrier degrees of freedom would form redundant constraints or serve as an additional basis for force distribution in the mechanism. In case less than three bearing satellite <b>gearwheels</b> are involved, at least axles of movable sun and/or of ring bearing <b>gearwheels</b> should be fixed relative to housing parts.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was equipped}} with four identical motors which were mounted fixed in the frames. The fully sprung drives were different on each frame, therefore the locomotive was also nicknamed Bastard. On side 1Tschanz driveswere mounted. The basic feature of this drive was the gimbal principle for the transmission of the torque between the big <b>gearwheel,</b> {{which was part of}} the gearbox connected to the unsprung motor, and the suspended drive axle. Because the gimbal-drives were able to be very short it was possible to omit - in contrast to the Be 2/5 - the hollow shaft {{to the other side of}} the locomotive. The diameter of the big <b>gearwheel</b> was limited by the loading gauge, therefore the cog transmission had to be cascaded in two steps because the engine speed of all four motors was identical. Side 2 contained single side mounted Buchli drives. Due to the great weight of those drives they were mounted transversally. The installation of the drive on both sides - as was used on the Be 2/5 - was not considered necessary any more.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{automation}} of {{the production}} process in different branches of industrie needs fast and non-contact measuring systems. It is desirable to integrate optoelectronical measurement systems directly in the production line. This paper describes the abilities and limits of measurement probes working by the method of laser-triangulation used for a high precision detection of the 3 D geometry of a workpiece made by a machine tool. Exemplary we used <b>gearwheels</b> to test the accuracy which is possible to reach by measuring high precision parts. We have constructed two different conceptions of laser probes making use {{of knowledge about the}} unfavourable conditions because of the micro- and macrostructure of <b>gearwheels.</b> We were able to reduce the measurement error which is caused by the mikrostructure of the gear significantly. Effects for the measurement because of the reflection {{at the bottom of the}} gear are virtually eliminated by the arrangement of the probe. Finally the laser system was applied to a computer controlled measuring instrument to compare the accuracy of the optical non-contact laser probe and mechanical probe. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of the <b>gearwheels</b> of the antiquity, which were generally characterized by triangular shaping of the teeth. The engagement of the conjugate profiles is analyzed in detail, calculating the temporal variation of the speed ratio due to the back and forth shifting of the relative instant center. The admissibility of the points of the theoretical contact path is carefully checked, estimating also {{the magnitude of the}} successive tooth collisions and ascertaining the energy losses arising from the particular nature of the coupling. Some very interesting results are that only one couple of teeth turns out to be active at each time instant and that the real path may belong to the only approach region or to the only recess region entirely or may be split into two separate sub-phases, the one in approach and the other in recess, or may even straddle both regions. The occurrence of each of these conditions depends on the average speed ratio (tooth ratio) and on the assigned clearance between the two wheels. It is also found that the speed oscillation is roughly contained in a ± 10 % range and the efficiency may reach rather high values, despite the presumable crude finishing of the ancient <b>gearwheels</b> due to the rudimentary technology used {{in the construction of the}} tooth profiles...|$|R

Because of its reliance on special epicyclical <b>gearwheels</b> rather than levers, this incredible watch can be quickly adjusted both forwards and backwards! In 1999 the perpetual calendar received the added GMT ± indicator. Incredibly, all calendar displays were synchronized to this local time indicator.

50|$|The player {{holds the}} handle and swings the whole {{mechanism}} around. The momentum makes the board click against the <b>gearwheel,</b> producing a clicking and rattling noise. A popular design consists of a thick wooden cog wheel attached to a handle and two wooden flanges that alternately hit {{the teeth of the}} cog when the handle turns. Alternatively, smaller ratchets are sometimes held still or mounted and the handle turned rapidly by the player. The mounted ratchets allow for greater control of the duration and timing of the sound. This allows the ratchet to be used like a snare drum, placing sustained rolls in precise durations of time. Dynamics are controlled by {{the rate at which the}} ratchet is rotated.|$|E

50|$|The sun and {{planet gear}} {{is a simple}} {{epicyclic}} gear. The planet is attached rigidly {{to the end of the}} connecting rod, hung from the beam. As it rotates it applies a torque to the sun gear, just as for a crank, and so causes it to rotate. As the two gears also rotate relative to each other, like conventional <b>gearwheels,</b> this has the effect of giving the sun gear a further rotation. The sun, and the output crankshaft, thus rotates twice for every piston cycle of the engine, twice as fast as with a conventional crank. Beam engines were slow-moving and the output shafts driven by the Lap Engine were fast-moving, so this was an advantage.|$|R
30|$|Under sterile conditions, the cell-bearing {{glass plate}} was {{attached}} to {{the lower end of the}} gear shaft with the cells facing the bottom plate.

Lastly, a larger petri dish, having a central recess (4  mm), with an externally attached electric motor, was reversely installed above to form the upper compartment. As shown in Fig.  1, the transmission between motor and gear shaft was realised by using two same-sized <b>gearwheels,</b> one fixed on each of the two components within the non-sterile upper compartment.|$|R
