60|$|The Black Hawk {{war broke}} out, and, the Governor of Illinois calling for volunteers to repel {{the band of}} savages whose leader bore that name, Lincoln enlisted and was elected captain by his comrades, among whom he had already {{established}} his supremacy by signal feats of strength {{and more than one}} successful single combat. During the brief hostilities he was engaged in no battle and won no military glory, but his local leadership was established. The same year he offered himself as a candidate for the Legislature of Illinois, but failed at the polls. Yet his vast popularity with those who knew him was manifest. The district consisted of several counties, but the unanimous vote of the people of his own county was for Lincoln. Another unsuccessful attempt at store-keeping was followed by better luck at surveying, until his horse and instruments were levied upon under <b>execution</b> <b>for</b> the <b>debts</b> of his business adventure.|$|R

50|$|An 1822 law allowed debtors {{freedom to}} roam a six-acre {{plot of the}} city (known as being 'on the liberty') if someone would post a bond on their behalf. This allowed them to work within those {{constrained}} limits and earn the money for their freedom. Reform politician John Rolph introduced a bill to abolish imprisonment <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> in 1829 but it was defeated by the Family Compact. The laws remained basically unchanged into the 1850s. The only alteration was in 1836, when the indefinite imprisonment until the debt was paid was reduced. A prisoner could appeal for release after 3 months <b>for</b> <b>debts</b> below £20; after 6 months <b>for</b> <b>debts</b> between £20 and £100; and after a year <b>for</b> <b>debts</b> greater than £100.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on sovereign debt that deals with the issues of a country’s ability-to-pay, its willingness-to-pay, and the policy responses to the debt crisis of the 1980 s. The existence of an ability-to-pay problem suggests a need <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> reduction, but plans <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> relief face potential incentive problems, and sovereign debt repurchases are not always a welfare maximizing method of debt restructuring. The paper synthesizes the main conclusions on these issues. With a willingness-to-pay problem, the potential penalties <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> repudiation are important in the endogenous determination of the repayment outcome. Penalties that are intertemporal in nature have different implications <b>for</b> <b>debt</b> repudiation than do intratemporal penalties. In addition, the asymmetric distribution {{of the costs of}} default can lead to a recurrent cycle of debt accumulation and default. ...|$|R
