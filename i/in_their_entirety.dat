In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked #6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list and is in its second season.

Compared to the previous game, the developers wanted Lara Croft Go puzzles to have fewer elements and be completely visible without scrolling, such that the player could see puzzles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>entirety</b> and focus instead on solving for the correct sequence. The camera also follows Croft rather than remaining stationary.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} increasingly adopt strategic management {{ideas from}} the private sector. One such idea is the organisation of professional and advisory services into centres of excellence. The strategic management literature includes normative guidelines on how to deploy such centres. However, previous {{research has shown that}} organisations usually not just adopt management ideas <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>entireties</b> but translate them in line with individual contexts. Applying a case-study approach, this paper explores how the Swedish public-sector context influences the deployment of centres of excellence. It finds that none of the adopting agencies follow the guidelines outlined in the literature, fully utilise the idea nor benefit from it as initially proposed. The main reason for this divergence is the discrepancy between the government agencies' context and the original idea, including barriers such as job security, decentralisation and regulations. Contextual modifications are suggested to allow agencies benefit more fully from deploying centres of excellence...|$|R
