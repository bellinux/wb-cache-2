40|$|This book is {{designed}} as a text for graduate courses in stochastic processes. It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial <b>economics</b> (<b>option</b> pricing and consumption/investment optimization). This book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed quantitative {{analysis of the}} use of seen questions within examinations in <b>Economics</b> <b>option</b> modules at one UK university. 4622 marks for seen and unseen questions awarded over a period of three years were analysed; the impact of personal characteristics was analysed using a sub-sample. It was found that the number of attempted answers to the seen question was somewhat lower than might be expected if students had engaged in random selection of examination questions and the proportion of students who attempted to answer the seen question varied both across modules and years. The majority of students who answered the seen question did so in only one module, and answering the seen question in more than one module did not {{have a positive impact on}} obtaining a good mark for the seen question. Most notably students who answered seen questions were more likely to obtain a good mark for seen than for unseen questions. The personal factors found to correlate with the likelihood of answering a seen question were gender, performance in Economics core modules, and type of school attended. Reasons for the findings are discussed and set within the context of innovation in Economics assessment...|$|E
40|$|MASTER OF SCIENCE IN RANGE MANAGEMENT (<b>ECONOMICS</b> <b>OPTION),</b> 2004 The East African {{governments have}} {{initiated}} land reform programmes {{with the objective}} of creating individualisation of land rights where rules of access, use and transfer are reformulated in order to adapt to rising population densities, land scarcity and agricultural commercialisation. This study assessed the effects of land tenure on land use and food security in Loitokitok Division, Kajiado District, Kenya. Purposive sampling was carried out by grouping locations within Loitokitok Division into two: those practising transhumance and the ones practising agropastoralism. Transhumance refers to seasonal movement with livestock for pastures and water while leaving the bulk of the households in permanent settlements. Agropastoralism refers to mixed farming in permanent settlements but sometimes includes transhumance. One location was randomly selected from each of the groupings and systematic sampling was carried out. Samples of 35 transhumant and agropastoral households respectively were then selected for the administration of a questionnaire. Also, village elders, chiefs and extension officers were interviewed, and more data were collected from annual reports and previous research studies. Data were analysed using both descriptives and regressions. Stratification of households showed that land tenure had influence on pastoral household size, herd size, milk yield, income from milk, total income, employment and remittance. In addition, agropastoral households were more food secure with a food poverty incidence of 0. 2 while that of transhumant households was 0. 6. The linear regression model showed that household size, diversification, total income, gender and land tenure had influence on both transhumant and agropastoral household food security at 5 per cent level of significance. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other stakeholders create awareness on issues of land tenure by gradually introducing the concept of individualisation of land rights in pastoral areas. Also, for improved income in these areas, there is need to increase the livelihood sources through micro industries such as milk processing plants, and hides and skins. This will provide job <opportunities and ready markets for their products. Further, family planning programmes should be provided to ensure household dependency ratio is reduced.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} tackles {{the current}} life insurance industry challenge to price and hedge minimum {{rate of return}} guarantees (MRRG) embedded in recurring-contribution life insurance contracts in a practical manner. The key contribution to the literature is to outline a practical approach to quantify and project the impact of dynamic hedging strategies for such options. MRRGs are typically very long-dated {{and as a result}} the validity of using typical financial <b>economics</b> <b>options</b> pricing models under incomplete market conditions remains a debate. However, life insurers need robust, practical solutions to assist them to manage market risk exposures for day-to-day solvency and income statement management. Literature specific to the topic of MRRG pricing and hedging over recurring-contribution life insurance products is sparse but Schrager and Pelssers’ significant contribution (Schrager and Pelsser 2004) provided a basis on which this dissertation was built. Schrager and Pelsser show these options to be analogous to Asian options written over a stochastically-weighted average of the underlying unit fund price. This dissertation demonstrates the effects of stochastic interest rates on MRRGs increase with maturity, as shown by Schrager and Pelsser. Consequentially, users {{should be aware of the}} effect and limitations of their choice of interest rate model when pricing MRRGs. Sensitivities for the various maturity terms of MRRG benefits are shown and provide readers with insight into the factors driving the dynamics of such options. A simple dynamic hedging program is outlined and projected under real-world evolutions on a daily basis, thus allowing the effectiveness of the hedging program to be tested.

40|$|In this journal, Welch and Mueller (WM) (2001) {{demonstrated}} a classificatory method for conceptualizing relationships {{between religion and}} economics. No judgement {{can be drawn from}} WM as to which of their four classifications might be a, or the, correct one. They conclude that the relationships are “both complex and controversial”, and that before any assessment can be apprehended adequately of how the two fields interact, “the permutations and subcategories implied by the system” used need to be identified and explored more thoroughly. This paper pursues that path, but argues that a more determinate verdict than WM's is possible. Here, an alternative interpretation of the relationship between religion and economics is investigated, in which WM's categories are assessed. In the alternative, WM's four classes are not taken to possess equal intellectual merit, as they appear to be. Using more current and comprehensive definitions of religion than WM's, a case is constructed that three of their four categories possess greater intellectual value than the remaining one.

40|$|While theorists differ sharply on the {{expected}} {{economic impact of}} stock options, typically empirical work has found a positive association between option schemes and firm productivity. However, existing data are limited and may not enable reliable investigation of the productivity effects {{of different types of}} option scheme. New panel data for all Finnish publicly listed firms during 1992 - 2002 enable us to distinguish plans that are broad based and others limited to particular employees and address issues of endogeneity concerning inputs and options. Diverse specifications are estimated including dynamic panel data models with a GMM estimator. For broad-based option scheme indicators the key result is that different estimators consistently find statistically insignificant associations with firm productivity. For selective option schemes, the baseline fixed effects estimator suggests a 2. 1 - 2. 4 % positive and statistically significant effect of a dilution indicator on firm productivity. However, in empirical models in which endogeneity and dynamics are taken into account, no evidence is found of a link with firm productivity. Thus our findings are consistent with hypotheses that predict negligible effects of option plans for enterprise performance, such as those based on free riding, or psychological expectancy theory or accounting myopia. However, by finding weak evidence for productivity effects of targeted schemes (and none for broad-based plans) our findings tend not to support hypotheses based on managerial rent seeking. personnel <b>economics,</b> stock <b>options,</b> productivity, panel data...|$|R

40|$|Smile-consistent" no-arbitrage {{stochastic}} volatility models take today's option {{prices as}} given, {{and they let}} them to evolve stochastically {{in such a way}} as to preclude arbitrage. This allows standard options to be priced correctly, and enables exotic options to be valued and hedged relative to them. We study how to model the dynamics of implied volatilities, since this is a necessary prerequisite for the implementation of these models. First, we investigate the number and shape of shocks that move implied volatility smiles, by applying Principal Components Analysis. The technique is applied to two different metrics: the strike, and the moneyness. Three distinct criteria are used to determine the number of components to retain. Subsequently, we construct a "Procrustes" type rotation in order to interpret them. Second, we use the same methodology to identify the number and shape of shocks that move implied volatility surfaces. In both cases, we find that the number of shocks is the same (two), in both metrics. Their interpretation is a shift for the first one, and a Z-shaped for the second. The results have implications for both option pricing and hedging, and for the <b>economics</b> of <b>option</b> pricing. Finally, we propose a new and general method for constructing a "smile-consistent" no-arbitrage stochastic volatility model: the simulation of the implied risk-neutral distribution. An algorithm for the simulation is developed when the first two moments change over time. It can be implemented easily, and it is based on the idea of mixture of distributions. It can also be generalized to cases where more complicated forms for the mixture are assumed...|$|R

While {{many of the}} mathematicians and software engineers on Wall Street failed when their abstractions turned ugly in practice, a special breed of physicists has a much deeper history of revolutionizing finance. Taking us from fin-de-siècle Paris to Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, from wartime government labs to Yippie communes on the Pacific coast, Weatherall shows how physicists successfully brought their science to bear {{on some of the}} thorniest problems in <b>economics,</b> from <b>options</b> pricing to bubbles. The crisis was partly a failure of mathematical modeling. But even more, it was a failure of some very sophisticated financial institutions to think like physicists. Models—whether in science or finance—have limitations; they break down under certain conditions. And in 2008, sophisticated models fell into the hands of people who didn’t understand their purpose, and didn’t care. It was a catastrophic misuse of science. The solution, however, is not to give up on models; it's to make them better. Weatherall reveals the people and ideas on the cusp of a new era in finance. We see a geophysicist use a model designed for earthquakes to predict a massive stock market crash. We discover a physicist-run hedge fund that earned 2, 478. 6 % {{over the course of the}} 1990 s.

A major issue in the analysis of CO 2 mitigation options is the fact that over 45 % of total electric {{power generation}} in North America is from coal. These existing coal-based power plants have the highest CO 2 emissions of any power systems yet are the lowest cost electric generators. Retrofit CO 2 reduction or recovery of existing coal-based power plants has definite advantages—using the existing site infrastructure, having facilities that are mostly paid-off or amortized, and having high baseline CO 2 emissions. However, retrofits also have disadvantages—significant capacity and efficiency losses that require replacement capacity addition, and increased fuel use depending on the choice of CO 2 mitigation technology. TransAlta is a major coal-based electric power generator in Canada and the United States. As discussed at www. transalta. com in the Sustainable Development section under “Our Actions,” TransAlta has a goal of zero net greenhouse gas emission (including trading and offsets) for its Canadian operations by 2024.

40|$|Although advance {{selling and}} {{probabilistic}} selling differ in both motivation and implementation, {{we argue that}} they share a common characteristic [...] both offer consumers a choice involving buyer uncertainty. We develop a formal model to examine the general <b>economics</b> of purchase <b>options</b> that involve buyer uncertainty, explore the differences in buyer uncertainty created via these two strategies, and derive conditions under which one dominates the other. We show that the seller can address unobservable buyer heterogeneity by inducing sales involving buyer uncertainty via two different mechanisms: (1) homogenizing heterogeneous consumers and (2) separating heterogeneous consumers. Offering advance sales encourages customers to purchase while they are uncertain about their consumption states (more homogeneous), but offering probabilistic goods encourages customers to reveal their heterogeneity via self-selecting {{whether or not to}} purchase the uncertain product. The relative attractiveness of these two selling strategies depends on the degree of two types of buyer heterogeneity: (1) Max_Value-Heterogeneity, which is the variation in consumers' valuations for their preferred good, and (2) Strength-Heterogeneity, which is the variation in the strength of consumers' preferences. Neither strategy is advantageous unless the market exhibits sufficient Max_Value-Heterogeneity. However, whereas Strength-Heterogeneity can destroy the profit advantage of advance selling, a mid-range of Strength-Heterogeneity is necessary for probabilistic selling to be advantageous. advance selling, probabilistic selling, demand uncertainty, consumer heterogeneity, pricing...|$|R
