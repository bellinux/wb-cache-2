2500|$|In {{reviewing}} Goold's {{revival of}} the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in 2008, Billington points out that [...] "Hirst, a litterateur haunted by dreams and memories, is, as he tells Spooner, 'in the last lap of a race <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> forgotten to run'. [...] But, while his servants conspire to lead Hirst to oblivion, Spooner attempts a chivalric rescue-act, dragging him towards {{the light of the}} living. The assumption is that his bid fails, as all four characters are finally marooned in a no-man's land 'which remains forever, icy and silent'." ...|$|E
60|$|The 'provision grounds' of the Negroes {{were very}} interesting. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>longed</b> to behold, alive and growing, fruits and plants which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard so often named, and seen so often figured, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{expected}} to recognise {{many of them}} at first sight; and found, in nine cases out of ten, that I could not. Again, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>longed</b> to gather some hints as {{to the possibility of}} carrying out in the West Indian islands that system of 'Petite Culture'--of small spade farming-- which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> regarded, with Mr. John Stuart Mill and others, as not only the ideal form of agriculture, but perhaps the basis of any ideal rustic civilisation.

2500|$|Former New Age {{practitioner}} Karla McLaren {{has spoken}} about developing {{a system of}} cold reading without realising, saying in a 2004 interview that [...] "I didn't understand that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> used a form of cold reading in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis." [...] McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out {{many of the issues}} that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to [...] "lean into the reading" [...] and give her more pertinent information.|$|E
