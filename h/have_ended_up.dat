5|$|After {{successful}} athletics {{events at}} the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had {{either of the two}} larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige {{had been}} a royal clerk prior to his {{appointment}} to York in 1051, although the monks of Peterborough Abbey maintained that he {{had been a}} monk in their house. It is possible he was both a monk and a royal clerk. He delayed his visit to Rome to receive his pallium until 1055, when he was given it by Pope Victor II. During his time as archbishop he was claimed to have consecrated both John and Magsuen as Bishops of Glasgow, although the two bishops probably never lived in their diocese. John may <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> as the Bishop of Mecklenburg in Germany. Cynesige dedicated the church of the Abbey of Waltham Holy Cross in the presence of King Edward the Confessor around 3 May 1060. This was at the invitation of Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex. The chronicle of Waltham Abbey states that Cynesige did the consecration because the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant. However, there was an occupant of Canterbury, Stigand, but his election to Canterbury was not considered canonical by the papacy, and Harold may have excluded him because of concerns about Stigand's canonical status.|$|E

5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E

25|$|Soviet rugby {{might have}} had a much higher profile in the pre-war period if Lunarcharsky had lived a few years longer.

25|$|Had the war gone on {{a little}} longer for France, {{it is likely that}} all of the Amiot 143M would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in a {{training}} role, having been replaced by more modern bombers such as the Breguet 693. The obsolete plane was never intended to have such an important role come war time, but slow French production made its use necessary - often being pulled from training squadrons to shore up bomber groupes.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Wali Khan made limited {{contributions}} to Pakistan's polarised and corrupt political system. They challenged {{his claim that}} he was the major or sole spokesperson for Pashtuns, discounted the benefits of the 1973 constitution and the Simla agreement, and disagreed with his principles of not compromising with dictators. Others argue that if he had compromised with Pakistan's military establishment he may well <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> Pakistan's Prime Minister, but that his principles proved to be his undoing.|$|E
25|$|Before the Continuation War, the Germans offered Mannerheim command over 80,000 German {{troops in}} Finland. Mannerheim {{declined}} {{so as to}} not tie himself and Finland to Nazi war aims. Mannerheim kept relations with Adolf Hitler's government as formal as possible and successfully opposed proposals for an alliance. If Mannerheim had not also firmly refused to allow his troops participate in the Siege of Leningrad, they would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> becoming {{an integral part of}} the siege.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the giant}} impact {{model has been}} criticised for being too explanatory; it can be {{expanded}} to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim {{that much of the}} material from the impactor would <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels would be different, but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.|$|E

Transport Canada reiterated that the owner of the vessel remained responsible for her movements, and measures had been taken to monitor the position of the drifting ship.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio.

The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea how it could possibly <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 1898, Augustus Moore Herring {{took one}} of his gliders, fitted with a motor, to Silver Beach in St. Joseph.

While Herring had a powered heavier-than-air craft, {{he did not have a}} way to control it. It was left to the Wright brothers to perfect controlled flight five years later, and give themselves and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a place in history that might <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> belonging to Herring and St. Joseph.|$|E
25|$|When Thorbjørn Jagland gave {{evidence}} in the case, he agreed with Stoltenberg {{that it was not}} necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for memberships, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on. He did, however, tell the court that it was unacceptable to transfer money from AUF's main bank account to pay for membership fees. He also agreed, when pressed by the prosecutor, that membership numbers were too high when he was the leader. In his defense he stated that if AUF were to follow the law too rigidly, they would only <b>have</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with a quarter of the membership numbers that the Young Conservatives operated with. He said {{that it would have been}} absurd to follow the law to the letter.|$|E
