50|$|In the United States, Sprint PCS was {{the first}} company to build and operate a PCS network, {{launching}} service in November 1995 under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Sprint originally built out the network using GSM radio <b>interface</b> <b>equipment.</b> Sprint PCS later selected CDMA as the radio interface for its nationwide network and built out a parallel CDMA network in the Baltimore-Washington area, launching service in 1997. Sprint operated the two networks in parallel until finishing a migration of its area customers to the CDMA network. After completing the customer migration, Sprint PCS sold the GSM radio interface network equipment to Omnipoint Communications in January 2000. Omnipoint was later purchased by VoiceStream Wireless which subsequently became T-Mobile USA.

5000|$|Titan I {{also was}} the first true {{multi-stage}} (two or more stages) design. The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability. Martin, in part, {{was selected as the}} contractor because it had [...] "recognized the 'magnitude of the altitude of the altitude start problem' for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it." [...] Titan I's second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch <b>interface</b> <b>equipment</b> and the launch pad thrust ring with it. When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle. Titan I’s ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{critical}} {{step in the}} evolution of the Apollo Network came in 1965 with the advent of the DSN Wing concept. Originally, the participation of DSN 26-m antennas during an Apollo Mission was to be limited to a backup role. This was one reason why the MSFN 26-m sites were collocated with the DSN sites at Goldstone, Madrid, and Canberra. However, the presence of two, well-separated spacecraft during lunar operations stimulated the rethinking of the tracking and communication problem. One thought was to add a dual S-band RF system to each of the three 26-m MSFN antennas, leaving the nearby DSN 26-m antennas still in a backup role. Calculations showed, though, that a 26-m antenna pattern centered on the landed Lunar Module would suffer a 9-to-12 db loss at the lunar horizon, making tracking and data acquisition of the orbiting Command Service Module difficult, perhaps impossible. It made sense to use both the MSFN and DSN antennas simultaneously during the all-important lunar operations. JPL was naturally reluctant to compromise the objectives of its many unmanned spacecraft by turning three of its DSN stations over to the MSFN for long periods. How could the goals of both Apollo and deep space exploration be achieved without building a third 26-m antenna at each of the three sites or undercutting planetary science missions? [...] The solution came in early 1965 at a meeting at NASA Headquarters, when Eberhardt Rechtin suggested what is now known as the [...] "wing concept". The wing approach involves constructing a new section or [...] "wing" [...] to the main building at each of the three involved DSN sites. The wing would include a MSFN control room and the necessary <b>interface</b> <b>equipment</b> to accomplish the following:# Permit tracking and two-way data transfer with either spacecraft during lunar operations.# Permit tracking and two-way data transfer with the combined spacecraft during the flight to the Moon.# Provide backup for the collocated MSFN site passive track (spacecraft to ground RF links) of the Apollo spacecraft during trans-lunar and trans-earth phases.With this arrangement, the DSN station could be quickly switched from a deep-space mission to Apollo and back again. GSFC personnel would operate the MSFN equipment completely independently of DSN personnel. Deep space missions would not be compromised nearly as much as if the entire station's equipment and personnel were turned over to Apollo for several weeks.|$|E

40|$|This {{technical}} manual was developed under the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance continuous training initiative. The structured {{information contained in}} this manual will enable the reader to efficiently and effectively identify and control the technical detail needed to ensure that flight system elements mate properly during assembly operations (both {{on the ground and}} in space). Techniques used throughout the Federal Government to define and control technical interfaces for both hardware and software were investigated. The proportion of technical information actually needed to effectively define and control the essential dimensions and tolerances of system interfaces rarely exceeded 50 percent of any interface control document. Also, the current Government process for interface control is very paper intensive. Streamlining this process can improve communication, provide significant cost savings, and improve overall mission safety and assurance. The primary thrust of this manual is to ensure that the format, information, and control of <b>interfaces</b> between <b>equipment</b> are clear and understandable, containing only the information needed to guarantee interface compatibility.
