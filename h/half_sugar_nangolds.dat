40|$|International audienceCellulase Cel 48 F from Clostridium cellulolyticum was {{described}} as a processive endo-cellulase. The active site is composed of a 25 A long tunnel which is followed by an open cleft. During the processive action, the cellulose substrate has to slide through the tunnel to continuously supply the leaving group site with sugar residues after the catalytic cleavage. To study this processive action in the tunnel, the native catalytic module of Cel 48 F and the inactive mutant E 55 Q, have been cocrystallized with cellobiitol, two thio-oligosaccharide inhibitors (PIPS-IG 3 and IG 4) and the cello-oligosaccharides cellobiose, -tetraose and -hexaose. Seven sub-sites in the tunnel section of the active center could be identified and three of the four previously reported sub-sites in the open cleft section were reconfirmed. The sub-sites observed for the thio-oligosaccharide inhibitors and oligosaccharides, respectively, were located at two different positions in the tunnel corresponding to a shift in the chain direction of about a <b>half</b> <b>sugar</b> subunit. These two positions have different patterns of stacking interactions with aromatic residues present in the tunnel. Multiple patterns are not observed in nonprocessive endo-cellulases, where only one sugar position is favored by aromatic stacking. It is therefore proposed that the aromatic residues serve as lubricating agents to reduce the sliding barrier in the processive action.

5000|$|The {{original}} refinery {{was built}} in 1856, and by 1870 it processed more than <b>half</b> of the <b>sugar</b> used in the United States. The Havemeyer family established their first sugar refinery on Vandam Street in Manhattan {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth century. Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891) expanded the business in 1857 after he established the longstanding South 3rd Street factory on the Williamsburg waterfront. His son, Henry Havemeyer (1847-1907), named the company Domino’s Sugar in the early 1900s. Ships delivered sugar cane from across the world to the Domino Sugar Plant in Brooklyn, which was initially called the American Sugar Refinery Company. Several other factories followed, which created the greatest center of sugar refining in the world at that point in time. By 1870, more than <b>half</b> of the <b>sugar</b> consumed in the entire country was refined there. The largest of all plants is that founded in 1858 by Frederick C.

[...] The business was so successful that in May 1896, American Sugar became one of the original twelve companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A fire in 1882 caused the plant to be completely rebuilt in brick and stone, at least 10 stories high. Those buildings remain, albeit with some alterations made over the years.|$|R
