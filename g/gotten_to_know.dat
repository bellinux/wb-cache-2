5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E

Palafox was also named Visitador (royal inspector, representative of the king), to investigate the two previous viceroys. He served as Bishop of Puebla from 1640 to 1655, and as interim archbishop of Mexico from 1642 to 1643.|$|E

500|$|In its 2008 Year in Review, Television Without Pity {{declared}} Fringe {{one of the}} year's biggest TV disappointments, commenting {{that the}} show is [...] "entertaining" [...] and [...] "the cast is largely strong" [...] but the character development is insufficient. The show's main character, Olivia Dunham, was considered [...] "wooden and distant, and after half a season, we still haven't <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her." [...] The untrustworthy Nina Sharp is well acted but [...] "one-note and lazily written", and Lance Reddick's character is also [...] "underdeveloped".|$|E

500|$|The film (and {{subsequent}} novel) were memoirs {{written by}} Herman Raucher; they detailed {{the events in}} his life {{over the course of}} the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old. Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar [...] "Oscy" [...] Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War. Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> one another on a more personal level.|$|E
500|$|Salon.com writer Jonah Weiner said of {{the first}} season, [...] "Each episode wound up {{more or less the}} same way, with the humiliation of Poehler's quixotic, adorably doofy bureaucrat". Some critics said the show's {{characters}} and overall tone were too mean-spirited in the early episodes. While reviewers praised various cast members in individual episodes, some said the supporting characters in general needed to be more fully developed and provided with better material. Several wrote that some of the subplots were too predictable and risked becoming stale, such as Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark and the question of whether Andy and Ann would keep dating. Others said Leslie was too unintelligent and ditzy. Schur said that was not the intention of the writers, and the feedback prompted changes to the character in the second season. Years after the first season ended, Schur said he believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers who revisited the episodes enjoyed them more because they had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters better as the series progressed.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] is {{considered}} to be among the musical's original songs that both advance its storyline and provide character development; [...] "A Change in Me" [...] specifically allows Belle to further explore and elaborate on her newfound feelings for the Beast, adding dimension to their relationship. The song also further empowers Belle, expanding upon her dimension as a character. Appearing during the show's second act, the ballad is performed by Belle to indicate that her feelings towards the Beast have softened. Delivered simply, she explains to her father Maurice that she no longer longs for the things she had wished for earlier in Act 1's [...] "Belle (Reprise)", revealing just how much her time spent in the Beast's castle has transformed both her identity and perspective. Belle claims that she has evolved into a better person as a result of having <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and ultimately fallen in love with the Beast, the same individual she once viewed [...] "with abhorrence and dread". Forced to confront feelings she has never felt before, Belle tries to convince Maurice that the Beast is not the monster he thinks he is while explaining how much she has matured. According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, [...] "A Change in Me" [...] "encapsulate the show's sweet emotion." [...] Vladimir Bunoan of ABS-CBNnews.com felt that the ballad [...] "signal a break in [...] relationship".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the premiere, Terri Schwartz of IGN {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix", but did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material. The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy called it [...] "a standard first episode back, in that it once again does a lot of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I’m nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn’t goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but “The Ghost” is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider yet. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider.com, said that the series [...] "certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from" [...] the Marvel Netflix series, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you’ve <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> over the years." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. Parks and Recreation staff also felt {{part of the reason for}} the improvement was that the characters have become better developed, and viewers have come to like and care more about them. Likewise, Michael Schur believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers liked the second season better because they had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters better as the series progressed. Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season, and more distinct from Michael Scott. Several reviewers praised the decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale, like whether Andy and Ann would keep dating, and Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark. Others complimented the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which they said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts. Despite the vast change in critical reception, Parks and Recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to the show itself. Michael Schur said, [...] "I don't think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over the show. I just think we're getting better at it." [...] NBC officials compared the late rush of critical acclaim for Parks and Recreation to that of The Office, which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in the second season.|$|E

[...] Valentine called Robbie Reyes [...] "satisfactory" [...] and the Ghost Rider [...] "where things really shined"; [...] "ABC pretty much nail the look , and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he looks great in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast."

He concluded saying, [...] "the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [...] is known for ... if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you." [...] Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "a fun way {{to kick off the}} new season". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as [...] "way too CGI cartoony" [...] and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that [...] "Ghost Rider feels right" [...] and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films.

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not respect him, and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know him very well he replies [...] "Michael, I've known you for a very long time. And the more I've <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you, the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not respect him, he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E

Born and raised in a Dutch complex in the Indies, Haasse ("a white girl brought up in Dutch surroundings") had little contact with the native residents of the archipelago.

2500|$|Panizza's first {{collection}} of fiction, Dämmrungsstücke, appeared in 1890, received a modest amount of critical acclaim {{in the press}} and brought him to the attention of Germany's leading literary figures. By the end of 1890, the obscure psychiatrist had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> most of the Munich [...] "Moderns," [...] as the young naturalists called themselves, including Frank Wedekind, Otto Julius Bierbaum and Max Halbe. The most significant of these was Michael Georg Conrad, editor of the influential journal Die Gesellschaft since 1885. The two Franconians became close friends, and from 1890 to 1896 Panizza published over forty articles in Die Gesellschaft on widely varied topics, ranging from theater reviews to theoretical considerations of prostitution.|$|E
2500|$|Booker is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Elizabeth is voiced by actress Courtnee Draper. Baker and Draper's {{participation}} in the development process was atypical for most video games; instead of just coming in to record their lines, Levine considered them as collaborators on the story development process. The three spent {{a significant amount of}} time in the recording studio, improvising scenes and working on repeated recordings to try to find the right tone to present scripted dialog; such changes were then reflected appropriately in the game's story and dialog. Levine favorably contrasted Baker and Draper as [...] "the genius and the novice" [...] respectively; Baker had several previous roles in video game voice-overs, while Draper had none; the different levels of experience between the two helped to tighten the performances, the combination a [...] "potent mix" [...] according to Levine. Levine explained one case where Draper was struggling to give a convincing tearful performance when Elizabeth is having difficulty using her powers. Both Draper and Levine believed {{it would be helpful to}} have Baker provide Booker's loud, berating dialog alongside Draper to help Draper find the right emotional response to deliver for the scene. Levine considered the input of both actors of critical importance to be able to deliver a lot of information, both in words and emotion, in only a few lines of dialog. Levine also worked with the actors directly to script out specific scenes once they had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their characters before recording their voices. Despite working closely with Baker and Draper on characterization and creating dialog on the fly, Levine did not provide the actors with full knowledge of their characters' backstory or the overarching plot of the game prior to recording; according to Levine, this helped the actors to create the in-game connection between Booker and Elizabeth in a much more natural manner than reading with full knowledge of the script. Similarly, Levine has not told the developers on his team the whole story of BioShock Infinite, using the reveals to gauge their reactions and adjust the story as needed; this had created some strife in the team, as they would prefer working with full knowledge of the script, but Levine noted [...] "that's not the way we present stuff to the gamer".|$|E
