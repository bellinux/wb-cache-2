5|$|The same period, when a {{battered}} Byzantium defended itself against enemies on all fronts, {{also saw the}} <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> unexpected threat: the Rus' made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a raid against Paphlagonia in the 830s, followed by a major expedition in 860.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> viral or bacterial infection, {{in addition to}} the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E

25|$|Historians Keith Thomas and {{his student}} Alan Macfarlane {{revolutionized}} {{the study of}} witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology. They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent {{members of the community}} and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> set <b>of</b> values that was generating psychic stress.|$|R
5|$|Canada's post-war {{economic}} growth, {{combined with}} the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Canadian identity, marked by {{the adoption of the}} Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, the implementation of official bilingualism (English and French) in 1969, and the institution of official multiculturalism in 1971. Socially democratic programs were also instituted, such as Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, though provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Jenner's 1976 {{world record}} {{was broken by}} four points by Daley Thompson in 1980; Thompson's record was tainted by the U.S. led boycott of the Moscow Olympics.

This converted mark stood as the American record until 1991, when it was surpassed by eventual gold medalist, and world record holder, Dan O'Brien of Dan & Dave fame. , Jenner was ranked twenty-fifth on the world all-time list and ninth on the American all-time list.

5|$|The late 1930s saw the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> era of {{tolerance}} in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as {{the essence of}} democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long {{considered to be the}} domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} and communication of risk has changed significantly {{over the past}} 20 years or so, partially as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> regulatory scandals in Europe and elsewhere (Lofstedt 2004 : Majone and Everson 2001; Sunstein 2005), which have led to public distrust of regulators and policy makers. This increase in public distrust has resulted in <b>a</b> phasing-out <b>of</b> consensual-style regulation, and the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> model <b>of</b> regulation based on variables including public participation, transparency, and increasingly powerful non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became {{available to a}} wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature derived from the French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, Calcutta had two areas: White Town, {{which was}} {{primarily}} British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square; and Black Town, mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta. The city underwent rapid industrial growth {{starting in the}} early 1850s, especially in the textile and jute industries; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects, which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> babu class of urbane Indians, whose members were often bureaucrats, professionals, newspaper readers, and Anglophiles; they usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities. In the 19th century, the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens. In 1883, Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association, the first avowed nationalist organisation in India.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} independent movements which brought together {{hundreds of thousands of}} Indians was Mohandas Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement between 1920 and 1922 which aimed to reject British rule through non-violent means such as boycotting British products and consuming only local products. This movement also strengthened nationalistic feelings amongst the Indian population both in India as well as other parts <b>of</b> the world. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> this movement Gandhi was arrested and he spent two years in jail. However, the effects of this movement were far reaching as it spurred the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> generation <b>of</b> Indians from the Congress Party such as, Jawaharlal Nehru, C. Rajagopalachari and Subhas Chandra Bose (who would eventually become the leader of the INA) who would later on actively advocate for India’s independence.|$|R

5|$|The 14th {{century in}} England saw the Great Famine and the Black Death, catastrophic events that killed around half of England's population, {{throwing}} the economy into chaos and undermining the old political order. Social unrest followed, {{resulting in the}} Peasants' Revolt of 1381, while {{the changes in the}} economy resulted in the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> class of gentry, and the nobility began to exercise power through a system termed bastard feudalism. Nearly 1,500 villages were deserted by their inhabitants and many men and women sought new opportunities in the towns and cities. New technologies were introduced, and England produced some of the great medieval philosophers and natural scientists. English kings in the 14th and 15th centuries laid claim to the French throne, resulting in the Hundred Years' War. At times England enjoyed huge military success, with the economy buoyed by profits from the international wool and cloth trade, but by 1450 the country was in crisis, facing military failure in France and an ongoing recession. More social unrest broke out, followed by the Wars of the Roses, fought between rival factions of the English nobility. Henry VII's victory in 1485 conventionally marks the end of the Middle Ages in England and the start of the Early Modern period.|$|E

25|$|The {{best example}} of the <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> style is in the {{contemporary}} coinage.
