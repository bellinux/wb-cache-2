Research on ratites has attempted to enhance {{the quantity and quality}} of these products by focusing on the disciplines of breeding and genetics, reproduction and incubation, assisted reproduction, nutrition and animal welfare. Advances in these disciplines are discussed, and directions for future research are provided. © 2012 World's Poultry Science Association...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ratite</b> <b>farming</b> of has {{expanded}} worldwide. Due to the intensive farming methods used by ratite producers, preventive medicine practices should be established. In this context, the surveillance {{and control of}} some avian pathogens are essential {{for the success of}} the ratite industry; however, little is known on the health status of ratites in Brazil. Therefore, the prevalence of antibodies against Newcastle Disease virus, Chlamydophila psittaci, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Salmonella Pullorum were evaluated in 100 serum samples collected from commercial ostriches and in 80 serum samples from commercial rheas reared in Brazil. All sampled animals were clinically healthy. The results showed that all ostriches and rheas were serologically negative to Newcastle disease virus, Chlamydophila psittaci, Myco plasma gallisepticum, and Myco plasma synoviae. Positive antibody responses against Salmonella Pullorum antigen were not detected in ostrich sera, but were detected in two rhea serum samples. These results can be considered as a warning as to the presence of Salmonella spp. in <b>ratite</b> <b>farms.</b> Therefore, the implementation of good health management and surveillance programs in <b>ratite</b> <b>farms</b> may contribute to improve not only animal production, but also public health conditions...|$|R
40|$|Commercial ostrich {{farming is}} {{constrained}} {{by the absence of}} a formal animal recordingand evaluation scheme as well as by current farming practices. Artificial insemination mayhave an important role in overcoming these limitations, but requires a thorough knowl-edge of sperm morphology. Although the morphological characteristics of normal ostrichsperm have been documented, little information is available on the incidence and struc-tural peculiarities of defective sperm in this species. Semen smears were prepared fromthe ejaculates of five ostriches (Struthio camelus), stained and evaluated. Defects wereobserved in 17 % of sperm studied. Tail defects constituted the most common anomaly. Various forms of bending were the main tail defect, ranging from gentle to acute bends ofthe principal piece, Dag-like coiling at the head base, sharp reflexes of the midpiece as wellas coiling of the endpiece. In contrast, head defects were comparatively low in frequency,with macrocephalic sperm being the defect most frequently observed in this region. Bent,microcephalic, acephalic and round sperm heads were also noted but were few in num-ber. Cytoplasmic droplets occurred frequently in the fixed smears, either associated withthe sperm or as free-lying droplets. A small percentage of sperm with multiple defectswas recorded. The incidence of morphologically normal sperm in ostrich semen comparedfavorably with that reported in emu semen, another commercially <b>farmed</b> <b>ratite.</b> However,the range of defects differed appreciably between the two species. Sperm tail anomalieswere the most frequent category in the ostrich, whereas head defects comprised the maingrouping in the emu. Partial funding for the project was provided by the Western Cape Agricultural Research Trust, the South African Ostrich Business Chamber and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa through their THRIP program.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, {{there has}} been {{worldwide}} <b>farming</b> of <b>ratites,</b> particularly with ostriches, emus and rheas for feathers, meat, skin and oil. Most of these ratites are produced commercially outside their native habitat. This has raised concerns about welfare, particularly whether birds are provided the five freedoms: food and water; shelter; health care; alleviation of pain and suffering; and the freedom of movement. This paper reviews {{the factors that influence}} bird welfare before hatch with breeder, egg and hatchery management and after hatch with brooding and rearing systems, stocking density, handling, transport, disease and slaughter. Assessment of bird welfare in each of the production sectors in the industry is based on how well the five freedoms are being met. The review identifies egg handling practices and hatchery hygiene that can {{have a major impact on}} the subsequent health of hatched chicks. In addition, feeding of appropriate diets, reducing stocking density and improving housing can improve bird health and freedom of movement. When the husbandry practice of toe trimming is not practiced according to the best practice method, chronic pain may result and impair walking ability of birds. Stress and injuries to birds can be reduced when birds are handled correctly on farm and in the lairage and are transported using appropriate vehicles. Farmers, transporters and abattoir staff can have a major impact on maintaining bird welfare if best practice farming systems and husbandry practices are implemented. P. C. Glatz and Z. H. Mia...|$|R
40|$|Productivity of emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) farmed under {{industrial}} {{conditions in}} Saudi Arabia A {{study was conducted}} to record preliminary data on the productivity of emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in a mixed <b>ratite</b> <b>farm</b> in Central Saudi Arabia. New emus breeders started egg laying at 22 months of age with an average production of six eggs per female in their first season. Older birds had an average of 10 – 13 eggs/female/season. The mean fertility rate of emu eggs ranged between 65. 7 % and 77. 4 % over four production seasons while the mean hatchability rate ranged between 52. 2 % and 73. 1 % over the same four production seasons. The main causes of emu egg defection were: holes, size abnormality, cracks and excessive dirt. There was an overall embryonic mortality rate of 45. 5 % of the fertile emu eggs with the majority (66. 4 %) as late mortality compared to (33. 6 %) early mortality...|$|R
40|$|Animal Welfare; Vol. 11 The Codes of Practice {{developed}} for ratites {{in a number}} of countries place considerable importance on ensuring that the health of birds is closely monitored and that appropriate vaccines are used to prevent disease. Likewise, if the health of ratites is compromised, there are clear guidelines on actions required by farmers to improve the health of birds. The action required by persons in caring for the health of birds is a significant welfare responsibility. The welfare of ratites when using health as an indicator can range from minor ailments or infections with minimal concerns to the major health issues that cause considerable pain and discomfort to animals. When the death of the animal is potentially involved, immediate action is necessary to prevent mortality. Effective implementation of preventative health programmes that involve record keeping, preventative health measures, quarantine principles, biosecurity practices and monitoring of management practices can improve the efficiency of <b>ratite</b> <b>farms</b> and also improve bird health and welfare.

40|$|The ethics, or morality, {{of farming}} a {{relatively}} novel and undomesticated group of animals, the ratites, is considered. Ethical considerations for animal management centre on {{their right to}} life, bodily health and integrity, opportunity to use their senses and emotions, to have affiliations with conspecifics {{and be part of}} a worldwide species network, to play and to have control over one’s environment. Ratites are considered to present greater ethical problems compared to conventional animal farming because of their inherent unsuitability for farming for meat and other products and their limited level of domestication. This unsuitability arises principally from their large size, slow maturation and limited social structure relative to other farmed birds. The absence of a domestication influence to reduce aggression and flight distance means that they have a significant potential to inflict damage on themselves, their handlers and conspecifics. Bodily mutilations, such as declawing may mitigate damage to others, but is ethically questionable because of potential welfare impact and offence to integrity. It is concluded that significant ethical concerns surround <b>ratite</b> <b>farming</b> that make the practice of dubious value as a means of producing food and leather with due respect to the animals’ needs...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{reports on}} sperm {{structure}} in the emu do not adequately illustrate or describe all the salient ultrastructural features necessary for a meaningful comparison of normal and abnormal sperm in this species. As sperm morphology forms an important parameter in determining semen quality, and {{in view of the}} proposed role of artificial insemination in the <b>farming</b> of <b>ratites,</b> this article re-evaluates and complements the existing data on the topic, provides a fully illustrated description of emu sperm ultrastructure, and documents some unreported morphologic features. Conventional transmission and scanning electron microscopy and high resolution scanning electron microscopy were used to describe the ultrastructure of sperm harvested from the distal deferent duct of sexually mature birds slaughtered during the breeding season. In addition to broadly confirming the basic ultrastructural characteristics previously described for emu sperm, this study revealed a number of unreported morphologic features. These included distinct differences in surface properties between the acrosome and nucleus, the presence of a thread-like appendage near the base of the nucleus, variable positioning of the annulus relative to structures located at the midpiece–principal piece junction and regional differentiation of the principal piece. Although the emu displayed similar basic morphologic features to sperm of other ratites and the tinamou, marked structural peculiarities were obvious, notably the lack of an endonuclear canal and a perforatorium and the presence of significantly more mitochondria in the midpiece coupled with an absence of intermitochondrial cement. Although the broad morphologic features of emu sperm would appear to add credence to the general view that the ratites, together with the tinamous, form a monophyletic group {{at the base of the}} avian phylogenetic tree, it is also clear that emu sperm are distinctly different from those of the ostrich, rhea, and tinamou which together share morphologic affinities. This observation may lend some support to the alternate view that the Australasian ratites represent a separate clade that developed independently from flightless ancestors. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In <b>ratite</b> <b>farming,</b> the low male {{to female}} ratio in the mating system restricts genetic {{improvement}} and prevents {{reduction of the}} number of males kept on-farm for fertilisation of the female flock. These issues can be overcome and the industry can better realise its potential by using artificial insemination (AI) technology. It is the only practical method for intensive genetic improvement of reproduction and the production of eggs, chicks, oil, meat and leather. For AI to be feasible, we need reliable methods for semen collection, artificial insemination, prolonged storage of spermatozoa in the female tract, high rates of lay, efficient protocols for semen storage, and a panel of quantitative methods for measuring true fertility and hatchability, sperm supply rates in vivo and sperm viability in vitro. For both emus and ostriches, prolonged sperm storage in females has already been demonstrated. Methods for semen collection and artificial insemination, using animal-friendly techniques, have also been developed. Semen storage and cryopreservation protocols are yet to be optimised and we still need to overcome the male-dependent rate of lay, but adoption of AI technology by the ratite industries is now feasible. It also seems likely that these technologies will be relevant to wild ratites that need intensive conservation efforts, such as cassowaries, rheas and ostrich subspecies...|$|R
40|$|Animal Welfare; Vol. 11 This chapter {{examines}} some of {{the methods}} being used to assess welfare in ratites, identifies the welfare issues associated with declawing and highlights concerns with stockperson skills and brooder house management. Partial amputation of the toes of ratites has welfare implications. It causes ratites acute pain; they become flatfooted and change their gait and they can slip and fall over in wet paddocks and handling areas. However, the blunting of the claws reduces the bird’s ability to deliver kicks and injuries to other birds during aggressive encounters and improves skin quality in the flock and reduces the potential for handlers suffering injuries. The role of handlers in <b>ratite</b> <b>farming</b> is examined. While {{there has been little}} research undertaken in the ratite industry on skills of stockpersons, work with other livestock shows that it is essential that animal handlers have the skills to look after their stock and develop a good affinity with their birds. Livestock which are housed in facilities with good air quality grow faster and consume more feed than animals exposed to poor air quality. Improving air quality in ratite brooding facilities could improve production and provide a better working environment for farm employees. It is clear that declawing of ratites, stockperson skills and housing {{have a major impact on}} welfare. The accreditation of persons practising declawing, the training of stockpersons in ratite handling and improvement in air quality in brooding and rearing facilities would result in a significant improvement in ratite welfare.
