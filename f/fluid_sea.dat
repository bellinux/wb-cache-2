60|$|One other point, before I conclude, {{about this}} matter. These reefs, {{as you have}} just perceived, are in a most {{singular}} and unexpected manner indications of physical changes of elevations and depressions going on upon {{the surface of the}} globe. I dare say it may have surprised you to hear me talk in this familiar sort of way of land going up and down; but {{it is one of the}} universal lessons of geology that the land is going down and going up, and has been going up and down, in all sorts of places and to all sorts of distances, through all recorded time. Geologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that the stable thing in the world is the <b>fluid</b> <b>sea</b> and the shifting thing is the solid land. That may sound a very hard saying at first, but the more you look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that it is not a mere paradox.|$|E

40|$|Submarine {{turbidity}} currents {{are caused}} by the dilution of fine sediments in water, making {{the density of the}} mixture greater than the density of the environment <b>fluid</b> (<b>sea</b> water). The investigation on submarine turbidity currents is important as they can modify the bathymetry of the sea bottom by means of erosion and deposition of sediments. In this work we propose a mathematical model for 3 D submarine turbidity currents. Such a mathematical model accounts for the major issues: entrainment of environment fluid, sedimentation and deposition of sediments. Numerical results are compared with experiments. The agreement is fairly good and shows that the main features of the physical phenomenon are reproduced by the mathematical model...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the term ‘terraqueous territoriality’ to analyse a particular relationship between capitalism {{as a social}} formation, and the sea as a natural force. It focuses on three spaces – exclusive economic zones (EEZs), the system of ‘flags of convenience’ (FOC), and multilateral counter-piracy initiatives – as instances of capitalist states and firms seeking to transcend the geo-physical difference between firm land and <b>fluid</b> <b>sea.</b> Capital accumulation, it is argued here, seeks to territorialise the sea through forms of sovereignty and modes of appropriation drawn from experiences on land, but in doing so encounters particular tensions thereby generating distinctive spatial effects. By exploring the articulation between sovereignty, territory and appropriation in the organisation of spaces where land meets sea, the article seeks to demonstrate {{the value of an}} analytical framework that underlines the terraqueous nature of contemporary capitalism...|$|E

30|$|Age-related NADH oxidase (arNOX) is a cell surface protein shed {{into the}} {{circulation}} and other body fluids, which generates superoxide.

We measured arNOX activity in the coelomic <b>fluid</b> of <b>sea</b> urchin species with different life spans. Coelomic <b>fluid</b> of long-lived <b>sea</b> urchin species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus exhibited low levels of arNOX compared to the short-lived urchin species Lytechinus variegatus. arNOX activity {{was positively correlated with}} animal size in L. variegatus, whereas with S. purpuratus and S. franciscanus, arNOX activity and animal size were inversely correlated. The inverse correlation of arNOX activity with life span and decreased levels of arNOX with age in the long-lived species is consistent with a contribution of reduced arNOX activity to slower aging.|$|R

The methods used entirely rely on ROV-based high-resolution imaging and mapping techniques. Optical data are used to produce visual maps of the seafloor, {{in the form of}} geo-referenced video- and photo-mosaics, whereas acoustic techniques allow mapping the micro-bathymetry of the seabed, as well as the signal reflectivity of the sediment surface and of the water column.

On the technical side, some of the high-resolution techniques used in this thesis are not commonly used by the marine scientific community. This is particularly the case for large-area photo-mosaics.

40|$|Despite the {{important}} geologic, geotechnical and biogeochemical implications of <b>seabed</b> <b>fluid</b> escape, the abundance and global distribution of cold seeps remain poorly characterized. Globally, <b>seabed</b> <b>fluid</b> escape is sometimes associated with chemosynthetic communities. Fluid escape on continental margins {{has also been}} invoked as a possible trigger for submarine slope failures and seafloor collapse. Along the U. S. Atlantic Margin, acoustic and geochemical water column anomalies have been observed in the Hudson Canyon, the mid-Atlantic shelf break, and the Blake Ridge Diapir (ODP Leg 164 site 996). Of these areas, only the Blake Ridge Diapir site is known to host chemosynthetic communities, a strong seafloor indicator of active <b>seabed</b> <b>fluid</b> flow. In July 2012, NOAA Ocean Exploration Program expedition EX 1205 L 1 identified and characterized cold seeps within the Blake Ridge gas hydrate province, using the platform Okeanos Explorer and the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Sentry. The expedition observed seven spatially distinct water column anomalies using shipboard EM 302 30 kHz multibeam and EK 60 18 kHz single beam echosounders. These anomalies originate at the seabed and extend up to 900 m above the seafloor. Interpreted as bubble plumes, these anomalies correspond in six locations to Sentry-collected photos documenting chemosynthetic organisms (e. g. mussels and clams). Three plumes {{are associated with the}} known Blake Ridge Diapir seep site, while two additional plumes and newly discovered seep communities occur within 2 km of the original site. For the first time, a gas plume and associated seep community were also observed on the main Cape Fear Diapir. Co-located 3. 5 kHz subbottom data, including lines that re-occupy a 3 D survey conducted in 2003 across the Blake Ridge Diapir (doi: 10. 1029 / 2006 GL 028859), reveal subsurface conduits presently associated with these seeps and should allow us to constrain the plumbing systems in two and three dimensions. No methane seeps were found along 210 km of surveys conducted at the presumed upper edge of gas hydrate stability on the continental slope between Blake Ridge {{and the head of the}} Cape Fear slide. Nonetheless, the discovery of new seeps indicates abundant active methane escape along the southern portion of the US Atlantic Margin and calls for a reevaluation of the role of methane venting in regional seafloor processes there. In addition, these results triple the number of known cold seep communities along the US Atlantic margin, thus providing insight into biogeographic connectivity...|$|R
40|$|Almost all marine sediments possess enough {{rigidity}} {{to transmit}} shear waves. Shear waves {{are important in}} underwater sound propagation because compressional waves can be partially converted to shear waves or Stoneley waves at reflection boundaries. An equivalent-seabed model is an approximate method to sim plify the mathematical analysis and reduce the calculational expense in modelling water-bome shallow-water sound propagation, taking seabed shear-wave effects into account. According to this method, the seabed with rigidity is treated as an equivalent <b>fluid.</b> However, <b>seabed</b> shear-wave effects {{are included in the}} adjustable parameters of the equivalent fluid. The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate equivalent-fluid seabed models. Existing equivalent-fluid seabeds have been evaluated by calculating the reflection coefficient of the bottom. Meanwhile, shear-wave effects on reflection and on the total impedance of seabeds have been studied. A new effective-seabed model is proposed from the calculation of the effective impedance of the seabed. Comparison of the new model with the existing model shows that the new model agrees better with the solid seabed at low grazing angles. Furthermore, grazing-angle-dependent parameters of the equivalent-fluid seabed are proposed. RESUM...|$|R
