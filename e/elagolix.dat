50|$|<b>Elagolix,</b> a non-peptide, orally-active GnRH {{antagonist}} that {{is still}} in development, is currently in phase III clinical trials. Other non-peptide, orally-active GnRH antagonists that are also in development include relugolix (TAK-385), KLH-2109, and ASP-1707.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 {{the company}} {{announced}} that its drug to treat endometriosis had achieved its main and secondary goals in a study. The drug, called <b>elagolix,</b> reportedly showed statistically significant reductions in dysmenorrhea, or pelvic pain during menstruation as well as painful intercourse. As of 2016 the drug, being developed in cooperation with AbbVie, is in phase III clinical trials.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Limitated {{studies have}} {{reported}} the efficacy of GnRH antagonist on endometriosis symptoms. The aim of our study was to review all available trials to investigate the medical treatment of endometriosis with only GnRH antagonists, with special attention to pharmacodynamic activity, safety, and efficacy. METHODS: Pub Med and Sciencedirect database were searched using terms of "endometriosis treatment", "GnRH antagonist", and "Elagolix". The search was limited to clinical studies published in English. Title and abstract were screened to identify relevant articles. RESULTS:Five studies covering use of GnRH antagonist were found. A phase 1 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and inhibitory effects on gonadotropins and estradiol of single dose and 7 day <b>elagolix</b> administration to healthy premenopausal women; two phase II studies evaluated efficacy in patient with endometriosis. Moreover, there are two Phase III clinical trials just completed. CONCLUSION: GnRH antagonists may {{have the advantage of}} oral administration and lower incidence of adverse events. Currently, only Phase II studies have been published demonstrating promising results in terms of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. From the results of the phase III studies, <b>elagolix</b> may become a valuable addition to the armamentarium of pharmacological agents to treat endometriosis-related pain...|$|E
40|$|Suppression of sex-steroid {{secretion}} {{is required}} {{in a variety of}} gynecological conditions. This can be achieved using gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists that bind pituitary gonadotropin receptors and antagonize the link-receptor of endogenous GnRH, inhibiting the mechanism of GnRH pulsatility. On the other hand, GnRH antagonists immediately reduce gonadal steroid levels, avoiding the initial stimulatory phase of the agonists. Potential benefits of GnRH antagonists over GnRH agonists include a rapid onset and reversibility of action. Older GnRH antagonists are synthetic peptides, obtained by modifications of certain amino acids in the native GnRH sequence. They require subcutaneous injections, implantation of long-acting depots. The peptide structure is responsible for histamine-related adverse events and the tendency to elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Areas Covered: Research has worked towards the development of non-peptidic molecules exerting antagonist action on GnRH. They are available for oral administration and may have a more beneficial safety profile in comparison with peptide GnRH antagonists. This article focuses on the data of the literature about <b>elagolix,</b> a novel non-peptidic GnRHantagonist, in the treatment of endometriosis. Expert Opinion: <b>Elagolix</b> demonstrated efficacy in the management of endometriosis-associated pain and had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate its non-inferiority in comparison with other endometriosis's treatments...|$|E
40|$|Uterine fibroids (UFs) are {{the most}} common tumors of the female genital tract. The effect of UFs on the quality of life and the overall cost of {{treatment}} are significant issues worldwide. Tumor size and location are the two specific factors which influence the occurrence of symptoms, the need for, and method of, treatment (some tumors require surgery while some can be treated with selected drugs). Primary prevention and treatment of early UF disease are worthy goals that might have a great impact on health care systems. Several treatments and prophylactic methods can be used in this endeavor. This publication presents current data about lesser-known substances which may have a beneficial effect on the treatment or prophylaxis of UFs and can be administered orally, serving as an alternative to (or complement of) surgery or selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs). Early prevention and treatment of UFs in women from high-risk groups should be our priority. Innovative forms of UF management are under intensive investigation and may be promising options in the near future. Many of them evaluated vitamin D, paricalcitol, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), <b>elagolix,</b> aromatase inhibitors (AIs), and cabergoline and deemed them to be safe and effective. The next step in such projects should be properly constructed randomized control trials (RCTs), carried out by successive phases...|$|E
