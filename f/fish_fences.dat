40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the role of traditional aquaculture systems and fish in food security and livelihoods of fishing communities in two states in Nigeria. The research focused on the productivity, sustainability and profitability of the aquaculture systems including social and economic conditions of farmers. The study also compared {{the relative importance of}} fish as a high quality protein source with meats in fishing communities in two states in Nigeria. Data were collected from 400 farmers with modern and traditional aquaculture systems in Niger and Lagos states using semi-structured questionnaires. Modern aquaculture consisted of small fish ponds with an average size of 0. 1 ha. Liming was not widespread among farmers with fish ponds but fertilisation was done before stocking by applying fertilisers of both organic and inorganic origins. Farmers (90 %) obtained their seeds from the hatcheries and the average stocking density was 5730 ha- 1. Polyculture was widely practised by farmers and local feeds were used in feeding fish. Fish shelters and <b>fish</b> <b>fences</b> were the traditional aquaculture systems that were widely practised in two states in Nigeria and are poorly researched and recorded. Various materials were used in the construction of traditional aquaculture systems including branches, elephant grasses, worn out tyres, PVC pipes and clay pots and, were constructed in order to aggregate fish. There was no significant (p > 0. 05) difference in yield of fish from fish parks and modern aquaculture systems. The study showed that fishermen prefer fishing in the vicinity of fish parks, tube shelters and <b>fish</b> <b>fences</b> because they make more catches around the installations. Cost–benefit analysis showed that traditional aquaculture systems are profitable because the level of investment required to set and maintain them is quite low compared to returns obtained from them. Fifty actively fishing and fifty non–fishing households in traditional fishing communities were randomly selected in Niger and Lagos states for fish consumption survey. A Simple scale was designed and given to each household to measure fish or meat entering the household for consumption. Intra household fish distribution and consumption was obtained by 24 hour recall method. A large number of fish species were consumed in the fishing communities confirming the relative abundance of the species in local rivers, floodplains and lagoons. Tilapia was the most consumed fish species contributing 19 and 32 % by weight of the fish consumed in Niger and Lagos state, respectively. Beef was the most consumed meat followed by goat meat. The study reveals high preference for fresh fish and meat. Highest fish consumption occurred in March corresponding to period of lowest meat consumption. Traditional aquaculture systems and capture fisheries were the main sources of fish in the fishing communities contributing 85 % by weight to fish consumed. Male heads of households consumed higher amount of fish than other members of the household. Average weight of fish consumed per person per day was 24 g. Fish contributed 77 % to total animal protein in diet of the people and was eaten daily by fishermen thus confirming the importance of fish in the food security of fishing communities.

However, the recommendation to provide 60 % of unimpaired flows in the San Joaquin River at Vernalis from February through June ignores several important flow requirements of Chinook salmon. First, there is very little discussion of the importance of water temperature, as affected by flow management, during the spring when most juvenile salmon undergo smoltification as a highly important determinant affecting juvenile salmon survival and adult salmon production. Second, there are no recommendations to provide fall pulse flows from each tributary to minimize the straying of adult San Joaquin River Basin Chinook salmon to the Sacramento River Basin.

5000|$|Tidal {{fences and}} turbines, if {{constructed}} properly, pose less environmental threats than tidal barrages. Tidal fences and turbines, like tidal stream generators, rely {{entirely on the}} kinetic motion of the tidal currents and do not use dams or barrages to block channels or estuarine mouths. Unlike barrages, tidal fences do not interrupt fish migration or alter hydrology, thus these options offer energy generating capacity without dire environmental impacts. Tidal fences and turbines can have varying environmental impacts depending {{on whether or not}} fences and turbines are constructed with regard to the environment. The main environmental impact of turbines is their impact on fish. If the turbines are moving slowly enough, such as low velocities of 25-50 rpm, fish kill is minimalized and silt and other nutrients are able to flow through the structures For example, a 20 kW tidal turbine prototype built in the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1983 reported no <b>fish</b> kills Tidal <b>fences</b> block off channels, which makes it difficult for fish and wildlife to migrate through those channels. In order to reduce <b>fish</b> kill, <b>fences</b> could be engineered so that the spaces between the caisson wall and the rotor foil are large enough to allow fish to pass through Larger marine mammals such as seals or dolphins can be protected from the turbines by fences or a sonar sensor auto-braking system that automatically shuts the turbines down when marine mammals are detected ...|$|R

Our objectives were to discover whether or not salmon smolts could carry DSTs and survive, whether or not useful data on thermal habitat could be obtained and interpreted, and whether or not salmon smolts moved vertically in the water column. Data were downloaded from 15 of the recovered tags and revealed the hourly water temperatures experienced by the fish for periods of 3 to 71 days. The data on the DSTs were analyzed for temperature patterns in relation to migration behavior and diurnal movement of the fish. While in the sea, the DSTs recorded night temperatures of 12. 5 °C, which were higher than day temperatures of 11. 6 °C; the record from moored recorders, however, indicated that sea temperatures actually declined at night. It is hypothesized that posts-molts avoid avian predators during daylight hours by positioning themselves deeper in the water column and that they were pursuing prey during the deeper vertical descents or ascents noted during the periods of more rapid changes in temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{pollution}} in Koluama Area in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria {{to determine its}} effects on fish species composition, histology, shrimp fishery and fishing gear type. A total of twenty (20) species belonging to eleven (11) families were recorded. Strongylura senegalensis, Lagocephalus laevigatus, Tarpon atlantica, Pristis pristis, Galeoides decadatylus and Butis koilomatodon were rare. Ephippion guttifer, Chaetodipterus goreensis, Sardinella maderensis, Sardinella aurita, Liza falcipinnis, Mugil bananensis, Pentanemus quinquarius, Polydactylus quadrafilis and Trichuris lepturis were common. Ethmalosa fimbriata, Liza grandisquamis, Sphyraena guachancho, Mugil curema, Sphyraena guachancho and Dormitator pleurops were abundant. None was dominant. The highest number of fish species (16) were recorded in fish town and none was recorded in Kuloma 1 and one (1) was recorded for Kulauma 11. Foroupa, Ekeni, Ejetu and Ikebiri fishing port 1 and 2 recorded 8, 7, 3 and 5 fish species respectively. Artisanal fishing is based on traditional methods of fishing using essentially canoe and different fishing nets which depend on the season and target fish species. Canoes may be motorized or hand-paddled. Common gear types include shrimp traps, drift gill nets, set gill nets, cast nets, seine nets, hook and lines. Lift nets may be use by women folk who target small shrimp species in the creeks and creek lets. Other fishing methods include hand-picking for periwinkles, oysters and other shellfish by women folk and children. Prominent among the fishing devices are edek, a type of <b>fish</b> <b>fence</b> used in the creeks; alot, a large trap used on sand and mud-banks in the estuaries; and otunwa, a barbed spear. Fishers using these devices either operated from their home villages, exploiting the nearby waters, or staged long distance fishing expeditions, during which they lived in distant camps or house-boats.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the first year}} of a three-year bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) enumeration project on the White River and is a co-operative initiative of the British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land, and Air Protection and Bonneville Power Administration. The White River has been identified as an important bull trout spawning tributary of the upper Kootenay River in southeastern British Columbia. The objective was to collect information on the returning adult spawning population to the White River {{through the use of a}} <b>fish</b> <b>fence</b> and traps, and to conduct redd surveys at the conclusion of spawning to provide an index of spawning escapement and distribution. The fence was installed on September 9 th, 2003 and was operated continuously (i. e. no high-water or breaching events) until the fence was removed on October 9 th, 2003. Estimation of the spawning population of White River bull trout was incomplete. This was due to a larger and more protracted out-migration than expected. As a result, the bull trout spawning population of the White River was estimated to be somewhere above 899 fish. In comparison, this represents approximately one third the population estimate of the 2003 Wigwam River bull trout spawning population. Based on redd index data, the number of bull trout per redd was over twice that of the Wigwam River or Skookumchuck Creek. This was expected as the index sites on the Wigwam River and Skookumchuck Creek cover the majority of the spawning area. This is not true on the White River. From previous redd counts, it is known that there are approximately twice as many redds in Blackfoot Creek as there are in the index site. Additionally, given the large size of the White River watershed and in particular, the large number of tributaries, there is a high likelihood that important bull trout spawning areas remain unidentified. Both floy tag and radio-telemetry data for the White River bull trout have identified extensive life history migrations. Similar data for the Wigwam River and Skookumchuck Creek populations illustrate there is considerable overlap and mixing among these three local populations within their over-wintering and feeding habitat. The upper Kootenay River, Lake Koocanusa and the lower Bull River provide overwintering and feeding habitat for the White River, Skookumchuck Creek and Wigwam River bull trout. Recommendations to improve escapement estimates and spawning distribution are provided. An accurate population estimate is especially important to provide baseline for any potential impacts due to wildfire and subsequent salvage logging that is currently underway immediately adjacent to and upstream of important spawning and rearing habitat in the Middlefork of the White River. Identification of important spawning habitat is important to meet management objectives for the White River...|$|R
50|$|Some of humans' {{earliest}} manufactured items {{may have}} been made from willow. A fishing net made from willow dates back to 8300 BC. Basic crafts, such as baskets, <b>fish</b> traps, wattle <b>fences</b> and wattle and daub house walls, were often woven from osiers or withies (rod-like willow shoots, often grown in coppices). One of the forms of Welsh coracle boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into wicker, which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow {{is less likely to}} split while being woven than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of boxes, brooms, cricket bats, cradle boards, chairs and other furniture, dolls, flutes, poles, sweat lodges, toys, turnery, tool handles, veneer, wands and whistles. In addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope and string can be produced from the wood. Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of aquaculture in lakes and reservoirs, its {{negative effects on}} water quality and aquatic organisms are clearly emerging. Toward {{a better understanding of}} these effects, chemical and biological monitoring was conducted in the Fangbian Reservoir to study the relationship between aquaculture and eutrophication. As a domestic water supply source, this reservoir has reached the mesotrophic level. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the Fangbian Reservoir have frequently exceeded the prescriptive level according to the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB 3838 - 2002). Pond and fence aquaculture feeding is the main cause of high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, accounting for nearly half of the total pollution, and causing the reservoir environmental capacity to be exceeded. The amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus that went directly to the reservoir through the residual bait and <b>fish</b> droppings in <b>fence</b> aquaculture were 42 768 kg per year and 10 856 kg per year respectively, from 2007 to 2009. About 2 913 kg of nitrogen and 450 kg of phosphorus were imported to the reservoir through the exchange of water from the culturing ponds at the same time. Therefore, controlling the aquaculture scale and promoting eco-aquaculture are key measures for lessening the eutrophication degree and improving the water quality...|$|R
40|$|Study {{on fishing}} {{operation}} of fyke net {{was conducted at}} reef waters at {{the west coast of}} Selayar Island from November 2008 to October 2010. The main objective of this research is to determine the best design and technical operation for environmental friendly catching of reef fish. Fyke net is chosen as an experimental fishing gear because its shape is a combination between basket trapnet ???bubu???, traditional fishing gear which is cosidered as environmental friendly fishing gear for catching coral reef <b>fish</b> and <b>fence</b> setnet (sero) shape. The first design of the experimantal fyke net follows the original shape, support with 5 rectangular steel frames and surrounding by 0. 75 inch of webbing 5 m in length, 1. 8 m in width and 1. 2 m in height. It has two 2 m fixed and 15 m flexible extended wings. Unlike ???bubu???, fyke net has not use bait for attracting the fish, therefore the entrance of fyke net should be large enough to make the fish entering freely. In two months of operations the fyke net did not show satisfactory results because the fish moved back and forward through the entrance of fyke net easily and the main problem was bycatch of turtels, therefore the second fyke net was designed. The new feature of the second fyke net was playground with rectangular vertical opening. The size of the opening was 150 x 15 cm devided into seven small entrances {{in order to protect the}} turtles entering the gear. To keep the fish inside the playground some 40 cm cableties are tied at the frame of the entrance functioning as shieves. In two months of operations the second fyke net was show better results however the new problem was the weight of the gear became heavier because of the increase of diameter of steelframe used, therefore, the third fyke net was designed to find a lighter gear. The third fyke net was supported by a rectangular polyvinil chloride (PVC) tube frames combined by polyethylene ropes, covered by 1. 25 inch of webbing. No more turtles was caught but more life reef fish was caught. To evaluate which design and methods of operation was better, three types of fyke nets and two methods of operations were examined. RAPFISH (Rapid Appraisal of Fish Status) is used to analyze which type of fyke net is the most suitable for reef fishing and to analyze the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear. RAPFISH applies a statistical ordination technique called multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Based on this analysis the third fyke net, lighter gear with PVC tube frames, shows the best value for it performance and technical operations, and fyke net is an environmental friendly fishing gear (value > 50. 0 in the range of 0 - 100). Ecological aspects gave the highest value for the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear followed by ethical, technological, social and economical aspects...|$|R

[...] Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty likewise notes, [...] "Anyone can capture fish in the ocean, or extract its resources, but only on the run, only as hunters and gatherers. No one can farm the ocean, no one can engage in aquaculture. In this way we are deprived of the use of the immense fish and mineral resources of the seas...Even now there is a simple but effective technique that could be used for increasing fish productivity: parts of the ocean could be fenced off electronically, and through this readily available electronic <b>fencing,</b> <b>fish</b> could be segregated by size. By preventing big fish from eating smaller fish, the production of fish could be increased enormously." [...] Mary Ruwart's Healing Our World states, [...] "Owners would also be more likely to invest in artificial reefs to bolster the fish population. Whalers could operate only with the permission of the owners, much as hunters must request permission to stalk deer on privately owned land.
