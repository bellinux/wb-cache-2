40|$|A common {{approach}} for demonstrating learning in online classrooms is through submittal of research essays of a discussion topic followed by classroom participation. Issues arose at an online campus {{of a university}} regarding the originality and quality of critical thinking in the original submittals. Achievement of new course objectives oriented to demonstrating synthesis and analysis were being impacted by questions which typically resulted in paraphrased reports <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>text,</b> websites and articles. This research study posited that conscientiously revising the types of questions, developing writing skills within the course, and utilizing rubrics which rewarded original content (the guidelines) could increase the original content within submittals. A mixed-methods approach was used. The experience of taking a combo Ac-counting/Operations Management Course for IT Majors {{was defined as the}} phenomenological case study. A section with the existing questions provided an 'as is' basis for content analysis. Changes to the course were developed by a panel of senior faculty and implemented in a pilot section of the course. The impact of the changes on the pilot section was measured using content analysis. There were varied improvements in the pilot course. While all Discussion Question (DQs) had increased original content, they were not equally improved. Further analysis revealed that ongoing content analysis and writing skills training would continue to improve results. ...|$|E
40|$|Experts and Novices” is a {{learning}} and teaching innovation which {{was introduced in the}} Faculty of Business and Law in 2009, designed to help students develop the critical analytical and synthesis skills required for a strong literature review. In brief, the approach involves nominating some students as “experts” and some as “novices” during selected sessions. “Experts” are those students who have completed in-depth reading of five journal articles on their chosen topic, whilst “novices” have just read a chapter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>text.</b> The “experts” are then responsible for briefing the “novices” on the topic during the session. The underlying thinking is that by having to sort out emerging themes from their reading and discussing these with peers, students would gain more {{confidence in their ability to}} synthesise different authors’ work critically, in particular by having to decide which research/evidence is most convincing. All of this would be completed in a non-threatening, low-risk environment. The original inspiration for the initiative evolved from the work on communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) although the initiative has since moved away considerably from the thinking in this area and is now much more closely aligned with notions of student-led learning and co-creation of knowledge. Since its introduction, the innovation has been disseminated at several conferences (e. g., HEA Business, Management, Accountancy and Finance Conference, Newcastle upon Tyne, 2010; the Academy of Marketing Conference, 2011 and the European Conference on Research Methodology for Business and Management Studies, Portugal, 2013). It has been presented at several University workshops and has been adapted by many colleagues with slight changes and re-namings, for example “Masters and Apprentices” and “Taking Part”. The Mini Conference During this academic year, the authors have added another element to the traditional “Experts and Novices” sessions by introducing the Mini Conference: a vehicle for ensuring all ideas presented during the session are exposed to the whole class. This has been possible due to the extra contact time allocated to the 30 credit module as part of the Kingston University Review of the Academic Framework (RAF) introduced in 2013. In brief, following two “Experts and Novices” 20 minute discussions, the “experts” are grouped together in small teams of four or five. Their brief is to develop a conference presentation on “Contemporary Developments” in their expert topic. Teams have an hour to prepare and they are required to produce a logical, coherent presentation of their collective ideas. Meanwhile, the “novices” are tasked with preparing a presentation in which they apply their new learning to a practical business scenario. Presentations can use as much or as little technology as the students choose, and last no more than ten minutes. During the mini conference, “Expert” presentations are alternated with “Novice” ones, giving both theoretical and practical aspects to the Mini Conference.

The goal is to attempt to design computers that can pass school science examinations (4th grade, 8th grade, and 12th grade) after preparing for <b>the</b> examinations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>texts</b> and study guides. The focus of the project is explained by the guiding philosophy that artificial intelligence is about having a mental model for how things operate and refining that mental model based on new knowledge. It was found that computers could learn better from study guides than from ordinary textbooks because study guides offered information more directly and avoided metaphorical language and digressions.|$|R
40|$|This {{course is}} an {{introduction}} to the use of quantitative data in sociology. The emphasis of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> is on understanding how researchers use such data to make sociological arguments. In order to appreciate this it is necessary to not only review some of the statistical methods used to analyze data, but also conduct such research using actual data. For this reason the assignments focus primarily on data analysis. The aim of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> is {{to show you how to}} understand the uses of different types of quantitative data in sociology, and to create and analyze simple and multivariate statistics using statistical software. The class will alternate between classroom (more lecture) and lab (more hands-on) sessions. The lab sessions will be held in Hilles 204, the lecture sessions in Link 309. There are weekly assignments associated with these labs. Because there will be limited time available to cover statistical techniques in class, you will be expected to be familiar with material <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>texts</b> or on-line material before class, so that you will be better prepared for completing the work on the computer. In essence, then, <b>the</b> <b>course</b> is set up in a way similar to a ‘blended-course’ or ‘flipped classroom,’ with the idea of spending class time on practical issues of analysis rather than lectures on statistical methods. This does not mean, though, that you will be able to complete all your work during class...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities, School of Education, 2011 This {{study is}} a located in a {{foundational}} undergraduate mathematics course designed to facilitate <b>the</b> transition <b>from</b> school mathematics to advanced mathematics. The focus {{of the study is}} on two innovations in the course; the use of practical problems that make links to non-mathematical practices and a learner-centred pedagogy. While these innovations are part of the discourse of the mathematics education community in terms of access to school mathematics, this study investigates the relationship between these innovations and access to advanced mathematics. The texts of three practical problems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> and <b>texts</b> representing <b>the</b> verbal and non-verbal action of 17 students as they worked collaboratively in small groups on these problems were analyzed. The analysis of these texts is used to describe and explain, firstly, how the practical problems in <b>the</b> foundational <b>course</b> represent <b>the</b> practice of foundational undergraduate mathematics and its relationship to other practices in the educational space (for example, school mathematics, calculus reform, advanced mathematics, and non-mathematical practices). Secondly, the students‟ enabling and constraining mathematical action on the practical problems is described and explained. Answering the empirical questions in this study has required theoretical work to develop a socio-political perspective of mathematical practice. This theoretical perspective is based on Fairclough‟s social practice perspective from critical linguistics, but has been supplemented with recontextualized theoretical constructs used by Morgan, Moschkovich and Sfard in mathematics education. These constructs are used to conceptualize the notion of mathematical discourse and action on mathematical objects in this discourse. The methodological work of this study has involved supplementing Fairclough‟s method of critical discourse analysis with Sfard‟s method of focal analysis to analyze mathematical, discursive, social and political action in a socio-political mathematical practice. The central finding of this thesis is that foundational mathematical practice represents both continuities and disruptions in its relationship to other practices in the space. As a result, participation in the foundational practice is complex, requiring control over the how and when of boundary crossings across practices, social events and texts. On the basis of this complexity, innovative foundational practice is positioned paradoxically in the higher education space. On the one hand, it represents an alternative to the dominant representation of mathematical practice and positioning of the foundational student in higher education. On the other hand, the complexity of foundational practice makes access to advanced mathematics problematic and foundational practice thus reproduces the dominant ordering...|$|R
