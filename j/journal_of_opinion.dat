25|$|The {{launching}} {{of a conservative}} weekly <b>journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> in a country widely {{assumed to be a}} bastion of conservatism at first glance looks like a work of supererogation, rather like publishing a royalist weekly within the walls of Buckingham Palace.

2500|$|After his conversion, he revived {{his former}} publication, now renamed Brownson's Quarterly Review, in 1844. From 1844 to 1864, Brownson {{maintained}} the Review as a Catholic <b>journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> including many reviews of [...] "inspirational novels" [...] meant to encourage Catholic belief.Thorp, Willard (1978). Catholic Novelists in Defense of Their Faith, 1829-1865. New York: Arno Press, A New York Times Company. A single volume in the complete set The American Catholic Tradition, [...] In 1853, {{he wrote a}} series of articles that claimed that the Church was supreme over the State. These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused him to fall from the ranks of American Catholic authority; bishops all over New England began condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely {{as a result of his}} being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the Review and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy. In 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment. He lapsed into a new form of liberalism that remained with him until his death, although his enthusiasm for such a liberalism must be balanced, or belied, by a near simultaneous and unambiguous repudiation of liberalism which he expressed in the resuscitated Quarterly Review in 1873. In 1862, he was nominated for a Republican Congressional spot in third district of New Jersey but was met with failure that was blamed on his open Catholic views. In 1864, John Frémont, whom Brownson strongly supported, withdrew from the Presidential race. After these two defeats, Brownson’s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the Review the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The Review finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death.|$|E
