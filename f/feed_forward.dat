25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. <b>Feed</b> <b>forward</b> can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of <b>feed</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hearing {{plays an}} {{important}} part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a feedback mechanism to fix speech errors. If a single feedback correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> mechanism. This is apparent in some deaf people. Deafness, as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it. However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> mechanism still helping to fix speech errors, {{even in the absence of}} auditory feedback.|$|E

[...] cMOOC instructional design approaches attempt to connect learners to each other to answer questions and/or collaborate on joint projects.

A large hole was cut through the spar {{allowing}} the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar.

The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.|$|E
25|$|The double flash {{illusion}} {{was reported}} {{as the first}} illusion to show that visual stimuli can be qualitatively altered by audio stimuli. In the standard paradigm participants are presented combinations of one to four flashes accompanied by zero to 4 beeps. They {{were then asked to}} say how many flashes they perceived. Participants perceived illusory flashes when there were more beeps than flashes. fMRI studies have shown that there is crossmodal activation in early, low level visual areas, which was qualitatively similar to the perception of a real flash. This suggests that the illusion reflects subjective perception of the extra flash. Further, studies suggest that timing of multisensory activation in unisensory cortexes is too fast to be mediated by a higher order integration suggesting <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> or lateral connections. One study has revealed the same effect but from vision to audition, as well as fission rather than fusion effects, although the level of the auditory stimulus was reduced to make it less salient for those illusions affecting audition.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{in order}} to undergo such {{physiological}} changes, there must exist continuous connectivity between these multisensory structures. It is generally agreed that information flow within the cortex follows a hierarchical configuration. [...] Hubel and Wiesel showed that receptive fields and thus the function of cortical structures, as one proceeds out from V1 along the visual pathways, become increasingly complex and specialized. From this it was postulated that information flowed outwards in a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> fashion; the complex end products eventually binding to form a percept. However, via fMRI and intracranial recording technologies, {{it has been observed}} that the activation time of successive levels of the hierarchy does not correlate with a <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> structure. That is, late activation has been observed in the striate cortex, markedly after activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to the same stimulus.|$|E

Communication within the barley-malt-beer chain is analyzed from four different angles: <b>feed</b> backwards, <b>feed</b> <b>forwards,</b> product integrity/safety and financial transactions and settlements. For each of these views specific administrative procedures and information flows are defined. Information flows are then translated into one or more informationcarriers (standard forms, EDI-messages).

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a {{longitudinal}} study of students who entered an ancient Scottish university directly from further education colleges (FECs) to discuss the role that different assessment regimes played in their university careers. It illuminates aspects of learning from feedback {{from the perspective of}} students whose pre-university experiences of assessment provided a major contrast to that of the majority of their peers. Overall it shows that students do learn from feedback and become able to self-assess and monitor their own learning and develop their own standards. It argues, however, that their experiences can be much more productive if there is more emphasis on <b>feeding</b> <b>forward</b> to meet changing expectations over time. This enables students to develop as independent learners and means that different strategies are appropriate at different stages of students’university careers...|$|R

50|$|Breitmeyer and Ögmen {{modified}} the two-channel model in 2006, renaming {{it to the}} retino-cortical dynamics (RECOD) model in the process. Their main proposed modification was that the fast and slow channels were actually <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> and feedback channels, instead of the magnocellular and parvocellular retino-geniculocortical pathways, which is what had previously been proposed. Thus, according to this new model, backward masking is caused when <b>feed</b> <b>forward</b> input from the mask interferes with the feedback coming from the higher visual areas’ response to the target, thus reducing visibility.|$|E

Here we present an experimental study toward demonstrating the controlled-X operation, a two-mode gate, in which continuous variable (CV) four-partite cluster states of optical modes are utilized. Two quantum teleportation elements are used for achieving the gate operation of the quantum state transformation from input target and control states to output states. By means of the optical cluster state prepared off-line, the homodyne detection and electronic <b>feeding</b> <b>forward,</b> the information carried by the input control state is transformed to the output target state. The presented scheme of the controlled-X operation based on teleportation can be implemented nonlocally and deterministically.

40|$|We {{show how}} an {{idealised}} measurement procedure can condense photons from two modes into one, and how, by <b>feeding</b> <b>forward</b> {{the results of}} the measurement, it is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only one mode is populated, commonly called "N 00 N states". For the basic procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead photons are detected at both ports, Schrödinger cat states are produced. We describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and another for subsequent conversion to a N 00 N state. Our approach scales exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include quantum imaging and metrology...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLhx 6 and Lhx 8 {{transcription}} factor coexpression in early-born MGE neurons {{is required to}} induce neuronal Shh expression. We provide evidence that these {{transcription factor}}s regulate expression of a Shh enhancer in MGE neurons. Lhx 6 and Lhx 8 are also required to prevent Nkx 2 - 1 expression in a subset of pallial interneurons. Shh function in early-born MGE neurons was determined by genetically eliminating Shh expression in the MGE mantle zone (MZ). This mutant had reduced SHH signaling in the overlying progenitor zone, which led to reduced Lhx 6, Lhx 8, and Nkx 2 - 1 expression in the rostrodorsal MGE and a preferential reduction of late-born somatostatin+ and parvalbumin+ cortical interneurons. Thus, Lhx 6 and Lhx 8 regulate MGE development through autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms, the latter by promoting Shh expression in MGE neurons, which in turn <b>feeds</b> <b>forward</b> to promote the developmental program of the rostrodorsal MGE...|$|R
