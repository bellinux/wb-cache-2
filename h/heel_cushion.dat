40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} {{is used by}} companies throughout {{the world as a}} substitution for manually testing prototypes. With the assistance of finite element analysis many companies and industries have decreased the time and cost of product production. Currently, the athletic shoe industry does not use finite element analysis in the shoe development process. The goal of this project was to implement finite element analysis into the athletic shoe design process with the intent of decreasing time to market and cost. This effort determined finite element {{analysis is}} not recommended to design and test an entire athletic shoe. The human factors and variability make simulation wear-tests on an entire shoe nearly impossible to accurately replicate via finite element analysis. Though human factors affect the entire shoe the most critical component, the <b>heel</b> <b>cushion,</b> is affected only slightly. Since a person's heel is {{in the shape of a}} ball, the variation of external forces caused by human factors is not significant. Thus, finite element analysis can be used to design and test the cushion of athletic shoes. by Maria E. Hidalgo. Thesis (S. B.)

They state that the pain decreases after walking on the foot for a while. Most patients tolerate the condition before seeking medical help. Present conservative treatments for plantar fasciitis include rest, physical therapy, <b>heel</b> <b>cushion,</b> non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, taping, orthotics, shoe modifications, night splinting, and cast. A fairly new method of treatment is extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). Despite numerous publications and clinical trials, one orthopedic application of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), which still remains highly equivocal, is the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis. The aim of this work was to determine the role of the extracorporeal shockwave therapy in the treatment of recalcitrant chronic plantar fasciitis. This study was carried out on 90 patients suffering from chronic plantar fasciitis recalcitrant to conservative therapies for at least 6 months.

The claws of 17 healthy controls were used for comparison. The left hind claws, frozen at - 20 degrees C, were sectioned in one longitudinal and four transverse planes with a band saw. The thickness of the subcutaneous tissue, the corium {{and the extent of}} displacement of the third phalanx were measured at defined sites on these sections. In addition, the suspensory apparatus, the tissue layer connecting the third phalanx to the dorsal wall of the horn capsule, was examined histologically. There was a direct relationship between the displacement of the third phalanx and ulceration of the sole or heel; in all the ulcerated claws the third phalanx had dropped and the corium and the subcutis under the bone were thinner than in the controls. The supportive cushions of the cows with ulcers contained less fat tissue.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of this study was to}} investigate the biomechanical influence of the walking shoe with a plate spring in the heel and interchangeable <b>heel</b> <b>cushioning</b> elements. Eighteen subjects walked in three conditions: 1) the walking shoes Type A- 1 with a soft heel insert, 2) the Type A- 2 shoe with a stiff heel insert, 3) a general walking shoe(Type B). Ground reaction forces, leg movements, leg muscle activity and ankle, knee and hip joint loading were measured and calculated during overground walking. During walking, the ankle is a few degrees more dorsiflexed during landing and the knee is slightly more flexed during takeoff with the Type A shoes. As a result of the changes in the walking movement, the ground reaction forces are applied more quickly and the peak magnitudes are higher. Muscle activity of the quadricep, hamstring and calf muscles decrease during the first 25 % of the stance phase when walking in the Type A shoes.

The boot was first released in three colourways: cinder/white/maize; University Blue/white/obsidian; and medium grey/ red. These three colourways were distinctive as they had limited <b>heel</b> <b>cushioning</b> and dimples on the inner heel cup for foot grip. This was upgraded for the remainder of the Vapor I line.

40|$|Accurate, 3 -D {{analyses}} of running impact require a constitutive {{model of the}} running surface that includes the material nonlinearity shown by many modern surfaces. This paper describes a hyperelastic continuum that mimics the experimentally measured response of a particular treadmill surface. The material model sacrifices a little accuracy to admit a robust, low-order hyperelastic strain-energy functional. This helps prevent the premature termination of finite element simulations, due to numerical or material instabilities, that can occur with higher-order functionals. With only two free constants, {{it is also a}} more practical design tool. The best fit to the quasi-static response of the treadmill was achieved with an initial shear modulus = 2 MPa and a power-stiffening index = 25. The paper outlines the method used to derive the material constants for the treadmill, a device that is not amenable to the usual materials laboratory tests and must be reverse-engineered. Finite element analyses were then performed to ensure that the treadmill model interacts with the other components of the multibody running system in a numerically stable and physically realistic manner. The model surface was struck by a rigid <b>heel,</b> <b>cushioned</b> by a hyperfoam material that represents a shoe midsole.

40|$|Humans {{have engaged}} in {{endurance}} running for millions of years, but the modern running shoe was not invented until the 1970 s. For most of human evolutionary history, runners were either barefoot or wore minimal footwear such as sandals or moccasins with smaller <b>heels</b> and little <b>cushioning</b> relative to modern running shoes. We wondered how runners coped with the impact caused by the foot colliding with the ground before {{the invention of the}} modern shoe. Here we show that habitually barefoot endurance runners often land on the fore-foot (fore-foot strike) before bringing down the heel, but they sometimes land with a flat foot (mid-foot strike) or, less often, on the heel (rear-foot strike). In contrast, habitually shod runners mostly rear-foot strike, facilitated by the elevated and <b>cushioned</b> <b>heel</b> of the modern running shoe. Kinematic and kinetic analyses show that even on hard surfaces, barefoot runners who fore-foot strike generate smaller collision forces than shod rear-foot strikers. This difference results primarily from a more plantarflexed foot at landing and more ankle compliance during impact, decreasing the effective mass of the body that collides with the ground. Fore-foot- and mid-foot-strike gaits were probably more common when humans ran barefoot or in minimal shoes, and may protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries now experienced by a high percentage of runners...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether certain ground reaction force parameters such as impact force (F 1), second maximum force (F 2), loading rate, stance time and average vertical ground reaction force (Fzavg) differ when 11 - 13 year old children run in a neutral shoe (Nike Air Pegasus+ 25) that is either a child or adult style. Shoes were impact tested in an impact test instrument to determine any performance differences between the two shoes. Next, 10 healthy female subjects aged 12. 03 ± 1. 14 years with a height of 154. 6 ± 4. 90 cm and a mass of 46. 18 ± 14. 33 kg with a shoe size between 3. 5 and 7 youth were recruited from the Las Vegas area to run 9 meters, a maximum of 40 times in the two shoes over a force platform. Loading rate was calculated using two methods: (1) rate of change in force between ground contact and F 1, and (2) rate of change of force within 10 ms bin between ground contact and 50 ms. In addition to recording biomechanical parameters, after each condition subjects filled out a survey to determine personal comfort for each shoe. Dependent variables (shoe impact data, F 1, F 2, Fzavg, stance time and loading rate) were analyzed using paired t-tests. Loading rate bins were analyzed using a 2 (shoe) x 5 (bin) repeated measures ANOVA. Survey data were analyzed using a paired t-test. From the mechanical impact test analysis, it was determined that there were significant differences in force, peak acceleration and percent energy between shoes (p 3 ̆c. 001). From the running test, it was determined that, loading rate was different (p=. 009) between shoe conditions whereas F 1, F 2, stance time, or average vertical ground reaction force were not different between shoes (p 3 ̆e. 01). It was also determined that there was no difference in loading rate between bins (p 3 ̆e. 05). From the survey data, it was determined that <b>heel</b> <b>cushioning</b> was the only parameter that was different (p=. 004) between shoes. In order to prevent overuse injuries, it has been reported that a lower loading rate can prevent possible overuse injuries. Because a larger loading rate was observed while running in the children 2 ̆ 7 s shoes it is concluded that the lower loading rate for the subject wearing the adult shoe may reduce overuse injury and is the better shoe choice for girls aged 11 - 13 years old (Nigg, 1997) ...|$|R

The proposed device stores the eccentric ankle work done from heel strike to maximum dorsiflexion in a hydraulic accumulator and then returns the stored energy to power push-off.

50|$|Minimalist {{shoes are}} an {{alternative}} option {{that can be}} seen as an intermediate between running barefoot or with traditional running shoes, as they lack the high <b>cushioned</b> <b>heels</b> of traditional running shoes.

The results showed that running at a fast pace in minimalist shoes caused a statistically significant redistribution of work from the knee to the ankle joint. Therefore, switching to a minimalist running shoe may be beneficial in preventing recurrence for runners who have experienced a knee injury in the past. However, the switch could also increase the risk of ankle and calf injuries. As with to barefoot running, runners who chose to switch to minimalist shoes should not start out at full training intensity.|$|R

30|$|Another {{factor that}} can have a {{significant}} impact on gait is the attenuation of ground reaction forces at foot strike. Appropriately, cushioned footwear redistributes and reduces plantar pressure [13, 15], while inadequate shock absorption will transmit large forces through the body, potentially resulting in injury [13, 15, 45, 46, 55, 56]. These forces can also result in gait changes by the wearer in an attempt to attenuate the force [42, 57]. When running in minimally cushioned shoes with a predominately rearfoot strike, the ankle is less dorsiflexed (i.e. flatter) at heel strike compared to cushioned shoes [57]. Military boots have consistently been associated with poor shock absorption [15, 45, 46, 56]. One study [55] found no significant evidence of a lack of shock absorption when inspecting ground reaction forces; however, the authors suggested that the subjects were subconsciously adapting to the increased loading. In contrast, studies have shown that footwear with <b>cushioned</b> <b>heels</b> may limit proprioception in the foot, thus compromising the ability of the body to adjust to the loads being applied [43, 58].|$|R

40|$|Eleven {{kinds of}} {{prosthetic}} feet {{that were designed}} for use in low-income countries were mechanically characterised in this study.

Dynamic properties, including damping ratios and resonant frequencies, were obtained from step unloading tests of the feet while interacting with masses comparable to the human body. Data showed that for walking, the feet can be appropriately modeled using their quasistatic properties since natural frequencies were high compared to walking frequencies and since damping ratios were small. Roll-over shapes, the effective rocker (cam) geometries that the feet deform to under walking loads, were determined using a quasistatic loading technique and a spatial transformation of the ground reaction force's centre of pressure. The roll-over shapes for most of the prosthetic feet studied were similar to the roll-over shape of the SACH (solid-ankle <b>cushioned</b> <b>heel)</b> prosthetic foot. All roll-over shapes showed a lack of forefoot support, which may cause a "drop-off experience at the end of single limb stance and shorter step lengths of the contralateral limb.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of prosthetic foot types on the postural stability among transtibial amputees when standing on different support surfaces. Materials and Methods. The postural stability of 10 transtibial amputees wearing solid ankle <b>cushion</b> <b>heel</b> (SACH) foot, single-axis (SA) foot, and energy-saving and return (ESAR) foot was assessed. Results were compared with able-bodied participants. Anterior-posterior stability index (APSI), mediolateral stability index (MLSI), and overall stability index (OSI) were measured by computed posturography in an upright stance on firm, foam, and unstable support surfaces. Results. The mean OSI score of SACH foot was significantly {{lower than that of}} an ESAR foot when the participants were standing on a compliant surface. When compared to able-bodied group, MLSI score was significantly higher for each of the prosthetic foot groups while OSI score was significantly higher for ESAR foot only in foam condition. Conclusions. Differences between prosthetic foot types and groups (amputees versus able-bodied) can only be distinguished when individuals were standing on a compliant surface. Amputees exhibited an increased postural instability in the mediolateral direction than able-bodied individuals. Hence, the restoration of stability in the frontal plane and the enhancement of proprioception at the residual limb should be the basis of rehabilitation programs...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{storage and}} return (ESR) feet {{have long been}} assumed to promote metabolically {{efficient}} amputee gait. However, despite being prescribed for approximately thirty years, there is limited evidence that they achieve this desired function. Here, we report a meta-analysis of data from ten studies which met our selection criteria to determine whether amputee walking with ESR feet is more efficient than with conventional solid ankle <b>cushioned</b> <b>heel</b> (SACH) feet. Additionally, the data were tested for a relationship with walking speed; since {{it has been suggested}} ESR feet might perform better at higher speeds. The raw data are highly variable due to differences in study protocols; therefore we normalised the data and found a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001) between ESR and SACH feet. However, the magnitude of this difference is small, with the cost of transport (COT) with ESR feet being 97. 3 % of the cost with SACH feet. No relationship between ESR COT and speed was found (p = 0. 191). In the authors’ opinion, these results suggest that ESR feet are not effective at improving amputee COT to a clinically relevant degree. We hypothesise this is due to limited push-off at the end of stance compared with able-bodied ankles...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to examine the prevalence of pressure ulcers and hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) and identify modifiable factors in patients who develop HAPU as the basis for subsequent quality assurance studies and improvement in hospital care. The study was conducted in five hospitals in two Swedish County Councils. A 1 -day prevalence study (n = 1192) using the standards of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes was conducted. The prevalence of ulcers was 14 · 9 % and 11 · 6 % were HAPU. Older age, more days of hospitalisation, less activity, problems with shear and friction and reduced sensory perception contributed significantly to HAPU. Pressure ulcer prevention strategies used more often in those with HAPU were risk assessment at admission, provision of a pressure relief mattress, having a turning schedule and using a <b>heel</b> or chair <b>cushion.</b> The prevalence of pressure ulcers continues to be a significant issue in acute care and the prevalence of HAPU is high. There is significant room for quality improvement in pressure ulcer prevention in Swedish hospitals. Future research needs to address both HAPU and community-acquired pressure ulcers and focus on preventive strategies, including when they are initiated and which are effective in mitigating the high HAPU rate...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} variation in foot strike types, lower extremity kinematics, and arch height and stiffness among Tarahumara Indians from the Sierra Tarahumara, Mexico. Methods: High speed video {{was used to}} study the kinematics of 23 individuals, 13 who habitually wear traditional minimal running sandals (huaraches), and 10 who habitually wear modern, conventional running shoes with elevated, <b>cushioned</b> <b>heels</b> and arch support. Measurements of foot shape and arch stiffness were taken on these individuals plus an additional sample of 12 individuals. Results: Minimally shod Tarahumara exhibit much variation with 40 % primarily using midfoot strikes, 30 % primarily using forefoot strikes, and 30 % primarily using rearfoot strikes. In contrast, 75 % of the conventionally shod Tarahumara primarily used rearfoot strikes, and 25 % primarily used midfoot strikes. Individuals who used forefoot or midfoot strikes landed with significantly more plantarflexed ankles, flexed knees, and flexed hips than runners who used rearfoot strikes. Foot measurements indicate that conventionally shod Tarahumara also have significantly less stiff arches than those wearing minimal shoes. Conclusion: These data reinforce earlier studies that there is variation among foot strike patterns among minimally shod runners, but also {{support the hypothesis that}} foot stiffness and important aspects of running form, including foot strike, differ between runners who grow up using minimal versus modern, conventional footwear...|$|R
