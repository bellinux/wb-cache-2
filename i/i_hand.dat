2500|$|Following {{the demise}} of Weddings Parties Anything, Thomas {{embarked}} on a solo music career. In 1998 he issued his debut solo album, Under Starter's Orders: Live at the Continental, which was recorded during various solo performances from 1997 to 1998, while still {{a member of that}} group. Allmusic's Aaron Badgley was impressed by the audience participation [...] "wonderful to hear the audience know [...] and to hear the pride in Thomas's voice". Aside from his own material Thomas is also a record producer and engineer for other artists. In March 1998 he produced the debut album, Fisherman’s Daughter by Perth-born singer, Kavisha Mazzella. In January 1999 he supported a tour by Elvis Costello. In October that year a track, [...] "Our Sunshine", co-written by Thomas and Kelly appeared on the Paul Kelly and Uncle Bill album Smoke. In 2010 Kelly recalled working with Thomas [...] "Mick was the right person for the song <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> in mind. We'd played and sung together often and shared an interest in folk music and Australian history. I had the beginnings of a melody, a few lines and, most importantly, a title – 'Our Sunshine' ... Mick and I knocked off the song by lunch". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2000, Thomas was nominated for 'Best Blues and Roots Album' for Under Starter's Orders.|$|E
