5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Traffic congestion in the valley {{is a serious problem}} during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
5|$|The area {{shares a}} common brown bear {{population}} with Norway and Russia. Other predators include red fox, stoat, pine marten and the rare wolverine and Eurasian lynx. The gray wolf was common until the 1940s. There {{is also a}} large population of moose. Inari–Pasvik has a shared population of 6,000 reindeer, which are herded to different areas <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Fences have been installed to hinder reindeer from wandering across the national borders.|$|E

5|$|The {{service was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{permanent}} population, {{although there are}} 12 active research stations housing a maximum average of 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with Cape Town, South Africa, are Troll Airfield, near the Norwegian Troll research station, and a runway at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E
50|$|Mombasa has a {{tropical}} {{wet and dry}} climate (Köppen: As). The amount of rainfall essentially <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> <b>The</b> rainiest months are April and May, while rainfall is minimal between January and February.|$|R

5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is quite different from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (<b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season).</b> At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E

30|$|One {{of the few}} negatives of {{physical}} fieldwork is that the location is only visited first hand at that specific time and date. While for some locations and purposes of fieldwork sites {{this is not an}} issue, for others the landscape dramatically changes <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> For example <b>the</b> flora and fauna differ <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> summer or winter seasons (Forman, 2014). Many other locations and the processes that govern that landscape change <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seasons.</b> <b>The</b> benefit of VFGs and the quick and easy options to update the field guides, allows a student to visit these sites in all of those different <b>seasons,</b> vastly reducing <b>the</b> cost of travel and in some cases mitigating against extreme weather (Tuthill & Klemm, 2002).|$|R

5|$|The African river martin feeds in flocks over {{river and}} forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight {{is strong and}} fast, {{interspersed}} with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape {{and the fact that}} mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, {{it is possible that the}} birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> or local circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} {{have been}} improved from Diamond and Pearl. The dialog boxes of previous games {{have been changed}} to speech balloons that appear over other characters' heads, allowing more than one character to speak at once. Japanese players can have kanji appear on screen, rather than only hiragana and katakana. During battles, the sprites of the Pokémon are fully animated and the camera changes position to highlight specific parts of the battle. In addition to continuing the day and night cycle introduced in Gold and Silver, Black and White introduces a seasonal cycle, with the seasons advancing every month rather than being linked to the calendar. Outside areas appear differently <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> such as changing of leaves in autumn or snow on the ground in winter. Certain areas are only accessible during certain seasons, and different Pokémon {{can be found in the}} wild in winter where others are encountered in the other seasons. The Pokémon Deerling and Sawsbuck change their physical appearance to match the seasons.|$|E
