5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process}} of learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing video game where players {{take control of}} Marth's army and Marth himself, the main protagonist of , across story-driven missions on the continent of Archanea. In between battles, characters can engage <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with each other, which advances the story.|$|E
5|$|Judd makes {{a second}} visit to Cortez, {{indicating}} that {{he wishes to}} join the Palladists. <b>In</b> <b>conversation,</b> Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming house. This makes the audience aware that the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room to kidnap her. In the truncated theatrical print, how the Palladists found Jacqueline is left unclear.|$|E

5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> and through reading. Word learning often involves physical context, builds on prior knowledge, takes place in social context, and includes semantic support. The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both {{play an important role}} in vocabulary development.|$|E
5|$|By {{chance he}} then runs into another man his age, {{the far more}} {{spontaneous}} Trygve Sissener, who has fallen asleep in the snow-covered street. The two spend the evening <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> over a few drinks at Sissener's house, and Odd is led to realisations about his own life. It emerges that his mothera free-spirited womanwas a ski jumper, but Odd himself never {{had the courage to}} try the sport. He now feels as if he has let her down, by never having the courage to seize the day and try new things.|$|E

Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1978, Messiaen retired from {{teaching}} at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with Claude Samuel.|$|E
5|$|Light House {{intentionally}} references the satirical {{novels of}} the early 19th-century British author and satirist Thomas Love Peacock, such as Headlong Hall and Nightmare Abbey. Peacock's novels have little plot and are best known for parodying the intellectual modes and pretenses of his contemporaries; his characters normally assemble in characteristic English country houses and predominantly engage <b>in</b> <b>conversation.</b> Nightmare Abbey satirized the English romantic movement and included characters based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|Shadowrun is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (RPG) that combines the statistical factor {{of the original}} tabletop game (with minor changes) with real-time gameplay. The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, {{she finds}} an old den made of logs and bedded with leaves, and settles down there. The next day, while hunting prey she {{encounters}} a tom named Pine, who engages <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with Sasha.

The next morning, a ShadowClan patrol consisting of Tigerstar, Rowanpaw, and Jaggedtooth comes along, and Sasha takes a particular interest in Tigerstar. After Rowanpaw scents traces of foxes, a frog appears, although he is unsuccessful at catching it. Before it can get away, though, Sasha drops on it and says that it slipped through their paws.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent <b>in</b> <b>conversation,</b> but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E

5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus in a three-syllable word, the first syllable has secondary stress; in a four-syllable word, the second syllable has secondary stress; in a five-syllable word, the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on. Long polysyllables are not often used <b>in</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although in most {{countries}} English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language. In {{the countries of the}} EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> by 12 percent of respondents.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{has held}} many titles and honorary {{military}} positions throughout the Commonwealth, is Sovereign of many orders {{in her own}} countries, and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of her realms she has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: Queen of Jamaica and her other realms and territories in Jamaica, Queen of Australia and her other realms and territories in Australia, etc. In the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies rather than separate realms, she is known as Duke of Normandy and Lord of Mann, respectively. Additional styles include Defender of the Faith and Duke of Lancaster. When <b>in</b> <b>conversation</b> with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as Your Majesty and thereafter as Ma'am.|$|E
