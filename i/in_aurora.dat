40|$|Excitation {{processes}} for O 2 (b 1 Sigma g+) <b>in</b> <b>aurorae,</b> <b>in</b> the nightglow, and in laboratory sources are discussed. It is {{shown that the}} observed vibrational distribution <b>in</b> <b>aurorae</b> {{is consistent with the}} O 2 (+) + NO charge-transfer mechanism. Arguments are presented for the case the quenching of O 2 (b) in vibrational levels above v-prime = 1 is rapid, and that therefore the auroral source is much larger than previously supposed. It is suggested that oxygen atoms are an efficient quencher for O 2 (b) levels above v-prime = 1...|$|R

5|$|Her {{father was}} William Nixon Lummis (1775–1833), a {{prominent}} physician who studied medicine in Philadelphia under the famous Dr. Benjamin Rush. In {{the early part}} of 1800, Dr. Lummis left Philadelphia and purchased the Pulteney estate in Sodus Point, Wayne County, New York. Elizabeth Lummis attended Aurora Female Seminary <b>in</b> <b>Aurora,</b> New York, where she studied, among other subjects, French, German and Italian. Her first published work, at age 16, was a translation of Silvio Pellico's Euphemio of Messina.|$|E
5|$|The first Philippine provinces to be {{impacted}} by the typhoon were Albay and Catanduanes, which suffered power outages after strong winds tore down power lines. One person was killed in Virac, Catanduanes after being electrocuted by a felled power line. In order to prevent more widespread outages, electrical service in some locations was deliberately shut down. Landslides triggered by Nanmadol <b>in</b> <b>Aurora</b> killed 25people. On the Bicol Peninsula, eight fatalities occurred due to drowning, electrocution, or hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{cancelled}} the Paris, Mexico, and Japan premieres of The Dark Knight Rises, {{and suspended}} the film's marketing campaign in Finland. Several broadcast networks also suspended television ads {{for the film}} in the United States. The trailer for Gangster Squad, another Warner Bros. movie included in the screening of The Dark Knight Rises, was removed as it contains a scene which shows gangsters shooting submachine guns at moviegoers through the screen, similar to the shooting <b>in</b> <b>Aurora.</b>|$|E

5|$|Damage {{assessments}} in the Philippines began on October31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross {{assisted in the}} immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000people <b>in</b> <b>Aurora.</b> The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited.|$|E
5|$|Striking the Philippines as {{a rapidly}} {{weakening}} system, Maysak had only minimal {{effects in the}} country, producing strong waves and light rainfall. Across Aurora and Isabela provinces, a total of 2,761people were directly affected by the storm, {{most of whom were}} evacuated prior to Maysak's landfall. No damage or loss of life was reported; however, four people were injured after waves generated by Maysak hit them while they were taking selfies along the shoreline of Dipaculao town <b>in</b> <b>Aurora</b> province on April4. An overloaded, unregistered ferry capsized off Sulu Province in Mindanao on April3, resulting in five deaths. The Philippine Coast Guard stated that seas at the time were calm and the sinking likely resulted from overcrowding of the vessel rather than Typhoon Maysak.|$|E

40|$|Auroral optical {{measurements}} made aboard NASA's CV 990 were analyzed. The measurements analyzed form a {{small part}} of extensive spectroscopic, photometric and photographic data gathered during the 1968 and 1969 Airborne Auroral Expeditions. Simultaneous particle measurements from ESRO IA satellite were used in the analysis. Information about magnetospheric boundaries, interaction between magnetosheath particles and the terrestrial ionosphere, the polar bulge in helium abundance and excitation mechanisms of the triplet state of atmospheric N 2 <b>in</b> <b>auroras</b> was obtained. Further analysis of the data is required to elucidate the relation between 3466 and 5200 A emissions of NI and the excitation of 3726 - 3729 A emissions from atomic oxygen ions <b>in</b> <b>auroras...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent rocket {{observations}} of the molecular nitrogen Vegard-Kaplan system <b>in</b> the <b>aurora</b> have been reinterpreted using an atmospheric model based on mass spectrometer measurements <b>in</b> an <b>aurora</b> of similar intensity {{at the same time}} of year. It is found that the population rates of the considered levels <b>in</b> the <b>aurora</b> are accurately determined by radiative cascade from two other states excited by direct electron impact. <b>In</b> some bright <b>auroras</b> the role of NO in quenching the lower vibrational levels of the A state is significant. The conclusions are based on a number of relevant auroral observations in combination with calculations using electron cross section and transition probability measurements by Shemansky and Broadfoot (1971) ...|$|R
