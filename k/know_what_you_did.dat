500|$|The opening segment, {{which shows}} Kang and Kodos {{attempting}} to entertain {{an audience of}} aliens, was [...] "born out of [...] love" [...] of comedy teams like Martin and Lewis and the Smothers Brothers. The plot of [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] {{is based on the}} 1997 horror film I <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer. At the beginning of the segment, the Simpsons are seen escaping from a group of vampires. Holding a package of Super Sugar Crisp cereal, Homer starts singing a jingle about the cereal. Super Sugar Crisp is a reference to the breakfast cereal Golden Crisp, while the jingle Homer sings references [...] "Can't get enough of that Golden Crisp", a jingle sung by Golden Crisp's mascot Sugar Bear during advertisements for the cereal. According to Scully, the series' staff had a lot of trouble clearing the song for the episode.

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.|$|E
500|$|Like BuddyTVs Don Williams, {{fans were}} very wary at first of {{bringing}} in female characters to the male-dominated show. To make matters worse, Kripke wrote a lackluster scene intended {{solely for the}} audition process. Fans quickly came across it on casting sites, and developed {{the feeling that the}} character [...] "really [...] ". However, Kripke believed that fans would change their minds about Ruby after learning that she was a demon. By the middle of the third season, Kripke felt enough fans were [...] "responding positively to vindicate the character", and that most were [...] "finally embracing her" [...] by the third season finale, with Cassidy's version of Ruby even being dubbed a [...] "fan favorite" [...] later on. When the character returns in the fourth season, she is much different than her third season counterpart. Cortese felt that while the drastic change made fans angry, the flashbacks provided in [...] "I <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer" [...] shed some light on Ruby's new mindset and made fans more accepting of the character. However, the overall criticisms towards Cortese's performance made her reluctant to return for an episode in the sixth season, although she eventually accepted when she learned she would be portraying herself.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Screams {{release the}} {{popularity}} of the horror genre had been considered to be in decline with many films released straight to video while those released in cinemas were sequels to popular and established franchises, such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, capable of drawing audiences despite decreasing budgets and diminishing critical reception. The glut of sequels contributed to audience familiarity with the icons of the late 1970s and early 1980s such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees that they were considered to have lost their ability to instill scares or interest in their audience. Scream, utilizing a popular and attractive cast and an innovative script that mocked and embraced the conventions of horror which had become considered clichéd, was credited with changing the status of the genre, becoming both a financial and critical success, and launching the careers of many of its actors. Such was the film's impact that some commentators considered its legacy as the creation of a distinct era of [...] "post-Scream" [...] horror films. Following its release many studios, including Screams own Dimension Films, rushed to capitalize on its unexpected success with the release of films such as I <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer (1997) and Urban Legend (1998) as well as sequels to popular, but diminishing, franchises such as [...] and Bride of Chucky.|$|E
