40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{examined}} the kinetic mechanism for binding of the homotetrameric Escherichia coli SSB protein to single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides [(dT) 70 and (dT) 35] under conditions that favor {{the formation of a}} <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> ssDNA complex in which all four subunits interact with DNA. Under these conditions, a so-called (SSB) 65 complex is formed in which either one molecule of (dT) 70 or two molecules of (dT) 35 bind per tetramer. Stopped-flow studies monitoring quenching of the intrinsic SSB Trp fluorescence were used to examine the initial binding step. To examine the kinetics of ssDNA wrapping, we used a single-stranded oligodeoxythymidylate, (dT) 66, that was labeled on its 3 ′-end with a fluorescent donor (Cy 3) and on its 5 ′-end with a fluorescent acceptor (Cy 5). Formation of the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> structure was accompanied by extensive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Cy 3 to Cy 5 since the two ends of (dT) 66 are in close proximity in the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> complex. Our results indicate that initial ssDNA binding to the tetramer is very rapid, with a bimolecular rate constant, k 1,app, of nearly 109 M- 1 s- 1 in the limit of low salt concentration (< 0. 2 M NaCl, pH 8. 1, 25. 0 °C), whereas the rate of dissociation is very low at all salt concentrations that were examined (20 mM to 2 M NaCl or NaBr). However, the rate of initial binding and the rate of formation of the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> complex are identical, indicating that the rate of wrapping of the ssDNA around the SSB tetramer is very rapid, with a lowe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{microscopic}} aspects of Calabi-Yau black holes in string theory. We compute the absorption cross-section of the space-time massless scalars by the world-volume of D 2 -branes, wrapped on the S 2 of an AdS_ 2 x S^ 2 x CY_ 3 geometry of a four-dimensional D 4 -D 0 Calabi-Yau black hole. The D 2 -brane {{can also have}} a generic D 0 probe-brane charge. However, we restrict ourselves to D 2 -branes with small D 0 -charge so that the perturbation theory is applicable. According to the proposed AdS_ 2 /QM correspondence the candidate for the dual theory is the quantum mechanics {{of a set of}} probe D 0 -branes in the AdS 2 geometry. For small but non-zero probe D 0 -charge we find the quantum mechanical absorption cross-section seen by an asymptotic anti-de Sitter observer. We repeat the calculations for vanishing probe D 0 -charge as well and discuss our result by comparing with the classical absorption cross-section.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to modeling in finite element analysis (FEA) creased thin-film sheets such as those used for drag sails, as well as modeling the packaging behavior of coilable deployable booms. This is highly advantageous because these deployable space structures are challenging to test on the ground due to their lightweight nature and the effects of gravity and air resistance. Such structures are utilized in the space industry due to their low mass and ability to be packaged into a small volume during their launch into space. It is shown that removing the crease bending stiffness in creased sheets still allows the deployment behavior of a benchmark problem to be captured, including deployment forces and equilibrium configurations. In addition, folding creased sheets from a flat state into a packaged configuration can result in crease crumpling and excessive wrinkling. To avoid this the Momentless Crease Force Folding (MCFF) technique is developed. Further presented is the behavior of tape springs and Tubular Rollable and Coilable (TRAC) booms when coiled to radii greater than their natural bend radius. Under these conditions the booms can form multiple localized folds which may jam during boom deployment. Understanding this behavior is important for extending the use of these booms to large scale space structures such as orbital solar power stations. A useful analytical model is developed determining when the localized folds in a tape spring will bifurcate and is verified against simulation results. Additionally, a numerical model of the wrapping an isotropic tape spring around a hub with a radius greater than the localized fold radii is validated against physical experiments. This model is used to predict trends in the force required to <b>fully</b> <b>wrap</b> a tape spring around a given hub radii. Finally, when examining the coiling and uncoiling behavior of TRAC booms {{it was found that the}} tension force required to keep a TRAC boom tightly coiled is significantly less than the force required to initially coil the boom. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{characterization}} of nanowires (NW) has inspired tremendous research efforts {{in a broad}} range of disciplines. The development of self-assembled NW growth enables the fabrication of defect-free single crystal nanowires. High-mobility III-V semiconductor nanowires have shown particular promise as channels in high-performance field effect transistors (FET). This work helps to advance the development and understanding of NWFET devices by introducing a new gate insulator, new device fabrication methods, and by studying quantum transport effects in new nanostructures: (i) Gate oxides cause a high density of charge traps at the nanowire surface. This reduces transistor performance in NWFETs. In this work, we introduce the organic polymer parylene as a new gate insulator. Using parylene will enable the incorporation of semiconductor surface passivation layers that have been shown to reduce charge trapping and enhance transistor performance. We built a custom chemical-vapor deposition system specifically designed to grow ultra-thin parylene films that can conformally coat single nanowires. Oxygen plasma etching in combination with lithographic methods were used to pattern the parylene thin films and create fully functional wrap-gated NWFETs that exhibit performance on par with oxide-insulated devices. (ii) The gate needs to <b>fully</b> <b>wrap</b> around the nanowire to maximize NWFET performance. In this work, we introduce a fabrication method that allows for the fabrication of multiple independent wrap gates on the same nanowire without additional processing steps. This method was used to create a logic gate and a common-source transistor pair, each on a single nanowire. We introduce a second fabrication method that significantly enhances the control over the gate-segment length, which allows for the creation of shorter wrap gates. (iii) Low-temperature measurements were conducted to advance the understanding of quantum transport phenomena in nanoscale III-V FETs. We report transport features in a GaAs nanowire that we attribute to one-dimensional conductance quantization. We also present the measurements on InAs nano membranes, a novel nanostructure grown by selective area epitaxy. These exhibit signatures attributed to magnetoconductance fluctuations, weak localization/antilocalization and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{equation}} of motion for a self-gravitating filament, we show how galactic spiral arms might be created and sustained. We find {{that the combination of}} differential rotation of the galactic disk and the self-gravity of the arm (as given by the equation) leads to a rotating spiral structure. Moreover, using this analysis, we then find a second differential equation that explicitly relates this spiral structure to the rotation curve of the galaxy – it connects several factors, including spiral shape and pat-tern speed. We also describe a simple many-body numerical experiment that supports our approach. The findings are with consistent with obser-vational evidence concerning arm structure and rotation curves, including leading arm structures. One school of thought holds that spiral arms of galaxies cannot be material – rotation curves imply that material arms, that is, arms populated with the same stars and particles, would wrap up as the galaxy turns [1, 2]. Therefore it seems that the spiral arm structure must be some kind of density wave – the stars rotate at the speeds given by the rotation curve, but somehow cluster along the spiral arms in the process. Various mechanisms have been offered for the dynamics of arms [1, 3]. Others believe that the arms are more transient in nature – breaking up before the differential rotation has had a chance to <b>fully</b> <b>wrap</b> them up [4, 5, 6, 7]. Some think that a central bar {{is an important factor in}} the formation of the arms [8], others have put forward the notion that the arms are the result of interactions with another galaxy [9]. In any case, the formation and sustenance of spiral arms might fairly be called a topic at least open for discussion. Here we offer a simple mechanism that can support either transient or long-term arms.

The results also show that U-shaped discrete strips or wraps of CFRP sheets of girders PS- 3 to PS- 8 enhanced the flexural capacity even if the girders were not <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> with continuous wrapping covering the entire girder sides.

This paper presents the results of systematic theoretical investigation of the structural and magnetic properties of gold-iron complexes at small size scale. Ab initio calculations are performed for AunFem with and without the presence of a sulfur atom, i. e., the clusters AunSFem, where n, m = 1 - 5. The study also includes Au 6 SFe and Au 12 Fe in order to investigate how the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> Fe atom responds to the Au atoms. The study mainly focuses on the geometrical and magnetic changes with a step by step removal of the sulfur atom as a function of the cluster size. It is found that average Au-Fe bond length is increased with increasing number of atoms in the cluster. An increase of Au-Fe bond length would have increased the magnetic moment of the Fe atom, but due to the hybridization of Au and Fe orbitals, the moment converges to about 3. 00 B. This value is higher than the magnetic moment of Fe atom in bulk gold. An enhanced magnetic moment is found on Fe atom even if it is <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> by the Au 12 octahedral cluster. From this study it is found that, the cluster stability is increased on the addition of a single sulfur atom to the AunFem clusters. ...|$|R
