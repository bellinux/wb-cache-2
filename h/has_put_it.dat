5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all together as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by {{one of our best}} science journalists.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian has pointed out that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his capture and {{imprisonment}} in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses which took place on 29 March 1461 at Towton in Yorkshire. This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York – and England's de facto new king – Edward IV entered York in triumph. Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands; as John Gillingham <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> 'the 'unfinished military business would have to be left to the Nevilles.' And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland. One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of Carlisle, 'with prompt action.' Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily relieved by him, apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process, before Warwick had even arrived.|$|E

25|$|Kabul's {{population}} was estimated in 2015 at about 4.6million, which possibly includes {{the people of}} the province as well. Another 2015 estimate <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> at 3,678,034. The city's population has long fluctuated due to the wars. A large number of Afghans from other provinces moved to Kabul in the last decade, mainly due to the war between rebel groups and Afghan government forces in their native areas.|$|E
25|$|Though these architects {{are listed}} by country, {{during this period}} there was an intense {{cultural}} exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> this was an architecture of democracy, not radical avant-gardism. Furthermore, {{with the exception of}} Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the First World War, allowing for continued cultural development.|$|E
25|$|The {{curtailment}} of busing in Milliken v. Bradley is one {{of several}} reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of Richard Nixon in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments. Also, the Court itself decided in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows — but does not require — a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state. Moreover, the Court’s decision in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite “inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others”, as Martha Minow <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 2021, choice {{will matter}} {{when it comes}} to {{secondary}} school admissions. Pupils will get a choice of six schools and have to rank these choices in order of their preference. If two pupils have the same PSLE score and have chosen the same school, the one who <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> down as a first choice will get priority over the one who listed it as a second choice. Computerised balloting will be used as a tie-breaker if there are two pupils with the same PSLE score and citizenship status, vying for a place in a school for which they have both listed in the same choice order.To get into the Express stream, pupils need to get a PSLE score of 22 or less, instead of a PSLE aggregate score of around 188 currently. For the Normal (Academic) stream, a score of 25 or less is needed, and for the Normal (Technical) stream, a score of 30 or less.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} Gibraltar, a small {{peninsula}} {{on the southern}} Iberian coast near {{the entrance of the}} Mediterranean Sea, spans over 2,900 years. The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into [...] "one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe", as one historian <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it.</b> Gibraltar's location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in medieval times, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.|$|E

On re-reading the play after his release from prison, Wilde said: [...] "It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that Tiger Life." [...] As one scholar <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to [...] "need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{war with}} Scotland had started under Edward I, {{cross-border}} raids and fighting {{had been the}} norm in Anglo-Scottish relations since the 1370s, generally {{in the form of}} Scottish incursions over the border and English attempts to repel them. The 1399 revolution, which eventually deposed Richard II, created further opportunity for Scotland to regain the land between the River Tweed and the Solway Firth. As Historian Chris Given-Wilson <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> 'England's confusion was Scotland's opportunity,' and in May 1399 Wark Castle was destroyed by a Scottish raid. The invasion, then, started being planned alsmost as soon as Henry took the throne.|$|E
500|$|The {{history of}} Gibraltar {{has been driven}} by its {{strategic}} position near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a narrow peninsula at {{the eastern side of the}} Bay of Gibraltar, [...] from the city of Algeciras. Gibraltar is on the far south coast of Spain at one of the narrowest points in the Mediterranean, only [...] from the coast of Morocco in North Africa. Its position on the bay makes it an advantageous natural anchorage for ships. As one writer <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "whoever controls Gibraltar also controls the movement of ships into and out of the Mediterranean. In terms of military and naval power, few places have a more strategic location than Gibraltar." ...|$|E

500|$|The French {{programme}} of excavation at Volubilis {{and other}} sites in French-controlled North Africa (in Algeria and Tunisia) {{had a strong}} ideological component. Archaeology at Roman sites {{was used as an}} instrument of colonialist policy, to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new [...] "Latin" [...] societies that the French were building in North Africa. The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites, excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches. Ruined cities, such as Timgad in Algeria, were excavated and cleared on a massive scale. The remains were intended to serve, as one writer <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> as [...] "the witness to an impulse towards Romanization".|$|E
500|$|The Diocletianic {{persecution}} {{was ultimately}} unsuccessful. As one modern historian <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> {{it was simply}} [...] "too little and too late". Christians were never purged systematically {{in any part of}} the empire, and Christian evasion continually undermined the edicts' enforcement. Some bribed their way to freedom. The Christian Copres escaped on a technicality: To avoid sacrificing in court, he gave his brother power of attorney, and had him do it instead. Many simply fled. Eusebius, in his Vita Constantini, declared that [...] "once more the fields and woods received the worshippers of God". To contemporary theologians, there was no sin in this behavior. Lactantius held that Christ himself had encouraged it, and Bishop Peter of Alexandria quoted [...] ("when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another") in support of the tactic.|$|E
500|$|Titanics {{discovery}} in 1985 sparked {{a debate over}} the ownership of the wreck and the valuable items inside and on the sea bed around it. Ballard and his crew did not bring up any artifacts from the wreck, considering such an act to be tantamount to grave robbing. Ballard has since argued strongly [...] "that it be left unmolested by treasure seekers". As Ballard <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> the development of deep-sea submersibles has made [...] "the great pyramids of the deep .... accessible to man. He can either plunder them like the grave robbers of Egypt or protect them for the countless generations which will follow ours." [...] However, within only {{two weeks of the}} discovery, a British insurance company [...] claimed that it owned the wreck, and several more schemes to raise it were announced. A Belgian entrepreneur offered trips to Titanic for $25,000 a head.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{workings}} of the plot remain elusive to most. Sharp digressed, [...] "o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." [...] As Zorn <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "plot and narrative devices {{take a back seat to}} mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." [...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoxha's {{strategy}} of [...] "people's war" [...] also caused friction with the Albanian armed forces. The bunkers had little military value {{compared with a}} conventionally equipped and organised professional army. As one commentator <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "How long could one man in each bunker hold out? How would you resupply each individual bunker? How would they communicate with each other?" [...] General Beqir Balluku, the Defence Minister {{and a member of}} the Politburo, publicly criticised the bunker system in a 1974 speech and disputed Hoxha's line that Albania was under equal threat from the United States and the Soviet Union. He argued that Albania needed a modern, well-equipped professional army rather than a poorly trained and equipped civilian militia. Hoxha responded by having Ballaku arrested, accusing him of being an agent of the Chinese and of working to bring about a military coup. Dubbed [...] "the arch-traitor Ballaku", the general and his associates were convicted and punished according to [...] "the laws of the dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] – meaning that they were executed.|$|E
500|$|Paine's Quaker {{upbringing}} predisposed him to deistic {{thinking at}} the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> Paine [...] "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand". His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language: it is [...] "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost". Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason; Davidson and Scheick argue that its [...] "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" [...] resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.|$|E
