25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. <b>Flip-Top</b> caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendable map light and a <b>flip-top</b> armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
500|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} or sausage-shaped (...) , smooth, and thin-walled. They are non-amyloid (not {{taking up}} iodine stain), and hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 22–37 by 10–15µm. The spore-bearing cells, the asci are eight-spored, cylindrical, and measure 600 by 15–17µm. They are operculate, analogous {{to having a}} <b>flip-top</b> lid mechanism to release the spores. Interspersed among the asci are thin, filamentous, branched paraphyses that extend beyond {{the tops of the}} asci.|$|E
2500|$|The Super Chief {{included}} dining cars, {{staffed by}} Fred Harvey Company personnel, {{as part of}} its standard consist from the outset. In general, the Super Chief operated 36-seat dining cars, although most of them were convertible to 48-seat dining cars with a <b>flip-top</b> (or change of) table and addition of chairs. Dining cars almost always operated with a lounge car coupled to them for bar-lounge service and a waiting area when the dining car was full. [...] Unlike the Union Pacific [...] "City" [...] trains, the Super Chief and other Santa Fe trains did not use the [...] "twin-unit" [...] dining cars. [...] Santa Fe, in general, ran somewhat shorter trains that could be serviced with a single dining car (although the heavyweight trains frequently operated in several sections, the streamlined trains generally did not). The height of Super Chief lounge and dining facilities came in 1951 with the new 600-series Dining Cars bracketed by the 500 series Pleasure Domes in front and a bar-lounge-dormitory unit in back (moved {{from the front of the}} trains). [...] The train still operated with the Vista-series 4 Drawing Room, 1 double bedroom observation cars on the rear, albeit without any bar or buffet service.|$|E
2500|$|Mercury {{commissioned}} a new tube chassis Comet for 1966. The Logghe Bros.-built car featured a one piece <b>flip-top</b> body. Nicholson's car, dubbed [...] "Eliminator I", was rarely defeated that season. It clocked [...] the first 7-second e.t. in Funny Car at Michigan {{in the second}} half of 1966. The only driver capable of defeating Eliminator I was Nicholson's teammate Eddie Schartman. Nicholson was so dominant, critics predicted the demise of the new Funny Car [...] "craze". Nicholson enjoyed another highly successful year in Eliminator II in 1967 until other teams started adding superchargers late in the year. Other teams had been running the superchargers before,but by the middle of '67 tire technology had caught up to the power produced by these cars and they began to [...] "hook up" [...] better rather than just spin the tires.Don started the '68 season with his now supercharged Comet.He won the Irwindale New Year's Day race.He had qualified second with a 8.03 and went on to set low ET at 7.99 while winning the event.At the AHRA Meet at Lion's Dragway on Jan 28.He qualified first with a strong 7.63 but he failed to win the meet.He did win the second annual Stardust National Open,beating his teammate Eddie Schartman in the final with a low ET run of 7.83.Most of Nicholson's earnings at this time came from match race competition. As he competed in his 7.3 second e.t. Cougar in 1968, Nicholson was becoming concerned about engine fires caused by blower explosions.|$|E

50|$|A <b>flip-top,</b> swing-top, or Quillfeldt stopper (after the inventor, Charles de Quillfeldt) {{is a type}} {{of closure}} {{frequently}} used for bottles containing carbonated beverages, such as beer or mineral water. The mouth of the bottle is sealed by a stopper, usually made of porcelain or plastic, fitted with a rubber gasket and held in place by a set of wires. The bottle can be opened and resealed repeatedly and without the use of a bottle opener, with the wires acting {{in the same way as}} a latch clamp. The <b>flip-top</b> was the dominant method of sealing beer and mineral water bottles prior to the invention of the crown cork.|$|E
5000|$|A {{precursor}} to the <b>flip-top,</b> the [...] "bail" [...] or [...] "Kilner" [...] closure was invented in 1859, where a lid with gasket was held by a wire harness and sealed by a separate set of wires.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dedicated}} funny car {{class was}} tried by NHRA at one 1966 national event, and {{at two in}} 1968, before Funny Car Eliminator was created in 1969. The trend to <b>flip-top</b> fiberglass bodies ("floppers") began with Jim Lytle's US$2000 Allison V-1710-powered chopped '34 Tudor Big Al II. It would inspire [...] "every flopper body ever formed". Chrysler's dominance led Hernandez and Al Turner to try and turn things in Mercury's favor; Don Nichsolson's <b>flip-top,</b> tube-chassis Comet, arriving in 1966, changed everything. [...] The “flopper”-bodied Comets were highly successful, {{in the hands of}} Chrisman, Kenz and Leslie, and Eddie Schartman; at the 1966 World Final, Schartman would become NHRA's first official Funny Car title winner.|$|E
