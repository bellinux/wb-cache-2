500|$|In 1945, when he {{was back}} in Montgomery, Williams started to perform again for radio station WSFA. He wrote songs weekly to perform during the shows. As a result of the new variety of his repertoire, Williams {{published}} his first song book, Original Songs of Hank Williams. The book only listed lyrics, since its main purpose was to attract more audience. It included ten songs: [...] "Mother Is Gone", [...] "Won't You Please Come Back", [...] "My Darling Baby Girl" [...] (with Audrey Sheppard), [...] "Grandad's Musket", [...] "I <b>Just</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> Could Forget", [...] "Let's Turn Back the Years", [...] "Honkey-Tonkey", [...] "I Loved No One But You", [...] "A Tramp on the Street", and [...] "You'll Love Me Again". Williams became recognized as a songwriter, Sheppard became his manager and occasionally accompanied him on duets in some of his live concerts.|$|E
500|$|The Oxford University Boat Club {{president}} and stroke Matthew Smith said [...] "It feels fantastic and I {{think it will}} take a while to top this feeling". [...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but I have such respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{reached his}} first BDO World Championship final in 2002. He {{narrowly}} beat Raymond van Barneveld 5–3 in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals he convincingly beat Colin Monk 5–1. He lost the final 4–6 to Tony David. King spoke on David's performance congratulating him and commented, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{could have played}} half {{as well as he}} did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lemme see! One {{might say}} <b>just</b> 'Pre'nez'! <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> knew the French for {{take hold of}} the rope!... I suppose they are French?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed I shan't!' Alice said rather impatiently. 'I don't {{belong to}} this railway journey at all--I {{was in a}} wood <b>just</b> now--and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could get back there.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel bad about it. It's not Beck the person, it's the words. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could have been more of a positive influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had {{a brother}} like Jim," [...] cried Fanny, for she felt the reproach in Tom's words, and knew she {{deserved}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it isn't curly," [...] said Maggie forlornly. [...] "And the matron won't {{let me put}} it up in curl {{papers at}} night. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> was Lizzie." ...|$|E
5000|$|Inspiration for {{the song}} came Cattle Call {{while he was in}} Kansas City {{watching}} the snow fall."Watching the snow, my sympathy went out to cattle everywhere, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> could call them all around me and break some corn over a wagon wheel and feed them. That's when the words 'cattle call' came to my mind. I picked up my guitar, and in thirty minutes I had wrote the music and four verses to the song." ...|$|R

That's when the words 'cattle call' came to my mind. I picked up my guitar, and in thirty minutes I had wrote the music and four verses to the song," [...] he said. [...] He recorded it again in 1936.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear, dear girl!" [...] {{he cried}} softly. [...] "Oh, I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had {{you all to}} myself for a moment!" [...] And {{he gave her a}} look that spoke volumes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I had a row with Harry Moss and Tom Rover, but it didn't {{amount to}} much, Gus. But, say, I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could square up with Dick Rover, and Tom, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. It {{would be}} idiotic! I {{knew there was}} {{mischief}} brewing. I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>wishing</b> that <b>I</b> {{had been}} out longer, and had a little more {{experience}} of men. Then I should know how to act. How do you suppose people do, generally?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I was <b>just</b> <b>wishing</b> that <b>I</b> had a--" [...] began Peter. Then {{suddenly}} {{he made a}} face. [...] "No, I don't either!" [...] he declared. [...] "I guess I'd better be getting home to the dear Old Briar-patch now. Mrs. Peter probably thinks something has happened to me." [...] And away he went, lipperty-lipperty-lip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Forester; [...] "but your {{asking me}} is <b>just</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to avoid. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to arrange {{it so that}} we shall both have our time to ourselves, without interruption." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my sonny, she is {{the right}} sort of good fairy, and I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could do her washing for love {{the rest of her}} blessed little life," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Morris, in a burst of grateful ardor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had a {{boy with}} some go in him; you ain't much better than a girl," [...] sighed Tommy, walking off to a pine-tree where some {{squirrels}} seemed {{to be having a}} party, they chattered and raced up and down at such a rate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! You can't {{expect a}} girl to hang back when she is asked to take a ride in a brand new automobile, and with such millionaires as Chester Waltham and his sister," [...] broke in another girl. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had the chance," [...] she added rather enviously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Mr. George, {{in a tone}} of disappointment, [...] "we {{have got}} here at twelve o'clock. That was <b>just</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> to avoid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray don't leave off telling me," [...] said Margaret--"it is <b>just</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> {{on my own}} account, and I know it is {{comfortable}} {{to have a good}} grumble." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{child must}} have been born shortly before 4 February 1902, when Einstein wrote: [...] "... now you see {{that it really is}} a Lieserl, <b>just</b> as you'd <b>wished.</b> <b>Is</b> she healthy and does she cry properly? [...] I love her so much and don't even know her yet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't be so rude, it's only a 'lapse of lingy', as Mr. Davis says," [...] {{retorted}} Amy, finishing Jo {{with her}} Latin. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{had a little}} of the money Laurie spends on that horse," [...] she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are looking}} for me, and will never think of this strange place. I can't make them hear, and must wait till morning. Poor Chris will get an awful scolding for letting me go. Don't believe he told a word till he had to. I'll {{make it up to}} him. Chris is a capital fellow, and I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had him here to make things jolly," [...] thought the lonely lad.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hasn't it been a {{perfectly}} splendid time?" [...] sighed Jane, {{as they drove}} away. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you {{were never going to}} begin. I think it was better than Mrs. Evans's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] said Miller hurriedly. [...] "Do not go <b>just</b> yet. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> {{to speak}} to you. I have asked you many times if you will marry me. Now I ask you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|But it {{was beyond}} human nature to endure this longer, and John {{interrupted}} almost with a scream. [...] "O, wheest!" [...] he cried, [...] "that's not all, that's not the worst of it--it's nothing! How could I tell you were proud of me? O! <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> had known; but you always said I was such a disgrace! And the dreadful thing is this: we were all taken up last night, {{and we have to}} pay Collette's fine among the six, or we'll be had up for evidence--shebeening it is. They made me swear to tell you; but for my part," [...] he cried, bursting into tears, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> was dead!" [...] And he fell on his knees before a chair and hid his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to see}} him. When {{they were}} all ranting and raving at me <b>just</b> now <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> he was there--I told them so. But now I don't feel like that--I can never see him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beans!" [...] Hannah cried. [...] "You're {{lucky to}} have any supper at all. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could get {{you to take a}} look at that oven--there's a hole you can put your hand through, if you've a mind to. I've done my best, I've made out to patch it from time to time, and to-day I had Mr. Tiernan in. He says it's a miracle I've been able to bake anything. A new one'll cost thirty dollars, and I don't know where the money's coming from to buy it. And the fire-box is most worn through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not stand it!" [...] cried Robinson fiercely; [...] "me {{not stand}} it! By gad! I'm made for it. I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{had a taste}} of the old life again for a while. And as for innocence! Well, I'll bet you you weren't one-tenth as {{innocent}} as I was; no, nor one-fifth, nor one-third! What a grand old life it was! You'll swear this is a darned lie and refuse to believe it--but I can remember evenings when I'd have two or three fellows in, and we'd sit round and play pedro by a candle half the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could wring {{that old}} fellow's neck!" [...] Mr. Bunny cried angrily as he shook one paw in the {{direction}} of Professor Hawk, who was slowly circling around with his eyes apparently fixed on Mr. Rabbit. [...] "'Squire Owl, the old one as well as the young one, is about as bad a bird as we members of the Fur section care to meet; but yet I think that old pirate is worse than all the Owl family put together, for the 'Squire's folks can't do much mischief except in the night, and the Hawk gang are at it all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m her captain, but <b>just</b> now <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> were an engineer,” he {{answered}} humorously. “She’s not running as {{she ought to}} do, and I’m afraid you’ll have rather a long trip. In fact, I think we had better go round behind the island where there’s smoother water. Will your people be anxious because you’re late?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I {{should like}} to get {{something}} out of death. I've been looking into it a bit. But {{for the life of me}} I can't find anything that telepathy, subconsciousness, and emanation from the storehouse of this world can't account for <b>just</b> as well. <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> could! <b>Wishes</b> father thoughts but they don't breed evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! {{there is}} no good. But can I help it, if I love him? Can I make myself not love him by <b>just</b> <b>wishing</b> it? Oh, <b>I</b> would do it if I could. But now you will {{understand}} why I shake my head when you talk of my coming to your house. Your ways and my ways must be different." ...|$|R
