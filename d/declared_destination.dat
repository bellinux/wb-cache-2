Rulloff wanted to be further away from his wife's family and he {{pressured}} her to move to Ohio, where he planned to work as a lawyer or college professor. When Harriet refused and threatened to return to her family with their daughter, on June 22, 1844, Rulloff accused her of having an affair with Bull and fatally hit her on the head with a pestle. Rulloff decided to commit suicide, but he found himself incapable. The next day, Rulloff borrowed a horse and wagon from his neighbors, the Andersons, with the pretense of returning a wooden chest to his uncle. Besides the chest, the Andersons saw Rulloff placing a half-full sack or pillow case in the wagon, and subsequently driving toward Cayuga Lake, on the opposite direction to his <b>declared</b> <b>destination.</b> When Rulloff returned, still with the chest, he told Mrs. Anderson {{that he and his wife}} would be out of town for a couple of weeks, and left his house in complete disarray.|$|E

Both sites share the sports facilities and canteen.The school has around 1000 pupils aged four to eighteen. As of 2009, the school has examination pass rates of over 99% at A-level, AS level and GCSE. The school does not reveal the proportion of those sitting the entrance exam who are then admitted. Almost all the girls proceed to higher education, with over 90% obtaining a place at their first choice of university.

30|$|The {{selection}} process is executed {{at the beginning}} of each block in a distributed manner based on the max-min criterion that maximizes the worst end-to-end SNR and reduces computational complexity [6]. After the channel estimation, the relays set a timer that is inversely proportional to their channel gain. The first relay whose timer is zero will send a pulse to the destination. Upon receiving the pulse, the <b>destination</b> <b>declares</b> the chosen relay [3]. It is observed that the end-to-end performance of relayed symbols is determined by the weaker between source-relay and relay-destination connections. We thus model a two-hop source-relay-destination link by an equivalent single-hop channel, which is highly accurate for DMF relaying protocol [3].|$|R
5000|$|As events unfolded, the {{dangerous}} nature of hitchhiking in what Israelis {{refer to as}} [...] "the territories" [...] prompted a debate, regarded by some in the settler and religious Zionist communities {{as a kind of}} victim blaming, about the practice of hitching rides on roads in the Palestinian territories, widely regarded as a cavalier and irresponsible habit for the costs involved in redeeming anyone who is captured. The normal Israeli practice is one where drivers pull up, <b>declaring</b> their <b>destination,</b> and, by their accent, allowing potential hikers at trempiada (hitchhiking stations) an opportunity to examine the cues, before they accept or decline a lift. Such hitchhiking has long been a hallowed method of travel among Israelis, but as abductions and killings of hitchhikers, mainly IDF soldiers, began to take root in the 1980s, one incident in October 1994 led to the passage of regulations that forbade military personnel from resorting to this method of travel. To hammer the message home, recruits doing basic training are required now to view snuff films that highlight the dangers, and military police [...] "abduct" [...] and punish recruits who do not take it seriously.|$|R

[...] Five days after her departure, the ship encountered a storm that allegedly blew it off course. Only then did Mexia's staff tell the volunteers aboard the ship that the Mary Jane was bound for Tampico, not for Texas. It arrived at the bar off Tampico, {{at the mouth of}} the Panuco River, on November 14, When the pilot arrived to guide the ship into port, Mexia discovered that no one had told him about the ship's pending arrival. Before the ship passed the bar, a storm blew in and caused the vessel to run aground. The ship began taking on water, so Mexia ordered his men to throw some of the artillery and other supplies overboard, believing that lightening the load would free the ship.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess zooeconomic parameters like age, weight, price and destinations of produced chickens that are sold on three main markets of Guera, east-central Chad. Data were collected over six months on the market places of Mongo and Mangalme and four months on the market place of Bitkine. The transversal and retrospective survey was coupled with direct observations and weightings. For 1549 marketed chickens, the males made up 57 % and the females 43 %. The average values per chicken were found to be 16. 29. 9 months for age, 1082. 4371. 2 g for weight and 1607. 8 FCFA 414. 6 for price. Average age and weight of sold chickens were significantly higher (p< 0. 001) on Mangalme market, with an average price significantly lower (p< 0. 001). On the whole, 52 % of surveyed chickens were intended for sale in the capital NDjamena, 39 % in Mongo city, 7 % in Bitkine and 2 % in Mangalme.

6000|$|Many of my {{readers will}} hardly believe me when I inform them that these {{passages}} are copied verbatim from your Appendix. Mr. Burke roused the indignation of all ranks of men when, by a refinement in cruelty superior {{to that which}} in the East yokes the living to the dead, he strove to persuade us that we and our posterity {{to the end of}} time were riveted to a constitution by the indissoluble compact of--a dead parchment, and were bound to cherish a corpse at the bosom when reason might call aloud that it should be entombed. Your Lordship aims at the same detestable object by means more criminal, because more dangerous and insidious. Attempting to lull the people of England into a belief that any inquiries directed towards the nature of liberty and equality can in no other way lead to their happiness than by convincing them that they have already arrived at perfection in the science of government, what is your object but to exclude them for ever from the most fruitful field of human knowledge? Besides, it is another cause to execrate this doctrine that the consequence of such fatal delusion would be that they must entirely draw off their attention, not only from the government, but from their governors; that the stream of public vigilance, far from clearing and enriching the prospect of society, would by its stagnation consign it to barrenness, and by its putrefaction infect it with death. You have aimed an arrow at liberty and philosophy, the eyes of the human race; why, like the inveterate enemy of Philip, in putting your name to the shaft, did you not <b>declare</b> openly its <b>destination?</b> ...|$|R
