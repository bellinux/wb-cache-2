5|$|With the {{exception}} of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth. All species go through delayed implantation, wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is <b>implanted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uterus. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place {{in the spring and summer}} months. Typically, single pups are born; twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born precocial. Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no lactose.|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be <b>implanted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: When {{planning}} implant therapy, {{knowledge of}} <b>the</b> bone volume <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>implant</b> area {{is needed to}} plan and place <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most appropriate locations from the prosthetic and surgical perspectives. Commercial software for digital planning of <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> craniofacial region is not yet available. This article describes a method that enables digital planning of extraoral <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mastoid region utilizing commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) software and rapid-prototyping techniques to manufacture a corresponding surgical guide. Materials and Methods: With the aid of CAD software designed for reverse engineering and three-dimensional animation, digital implant planning based on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning was performed. On {{the basis of this}} planning, surgical guides were digitally designed to facilitate the placement of dental <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mastoid area. The guides were fabricated using rapid prototyping. The appropriateness of the digitally designed surgical guides for placing extraoral implants was tested on six human cadaver heads with simulated bilateral ear defects. After implant placement, a second CBCT scan was performed to compare preoperative planning with the actual postoperative implant positions. Results: Twenty-four implants were placed. The surgical guide helped the surgeon to place the implants at the preoperatively planned positions. Comparison of the CBCT scans revealed that adequate accuracy of implant placement was achieved, both for deviation of the neck (1. 56 +/- 0. 56 mm) and the tip (1. 40 +/- 0. 53 mm) of the implant, and for deviation of the angulation of the implant (0. 97 +/- 2. 33 deg). Conclusion: The presented method for digitally planning extraoral <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mastoid area and designing surgical guides allows for placement of <b>implants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mastoid area <b>in</b> close proximity to the preoperatively planned implant position. The actual implant positions were satisfactory both surgically and prosthetically. INT J ORAL MAXILLOFAC IMPLANTS 2012; 27 : 703 - 707...|$|R

25|$|The {{functional}} role of synchronized oscillatory {{activity in the}} brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes <b>implanted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was {{in the range of}} 40Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions. Similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the {{functional role}} of neural synchronization in feature binding. Since then, numerous studies have replicated these findings and extended them to different modalities such as EEG, providing extensive evidence of the functional role of gamma oscillations in visual perception.|$|E
25|$|Tubal {{pregnancy}} {{is when the}} egg is <b>implanted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fallopian tubes. Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the fertilized egg to the uterus. Fallopian cilia are sometimes seen in reduced numbers subsequent to an ectopic pregnancy, leading to a hypothesis that cilia damage in the Fallopian tubes is {{likely to lead to}} an ectopic pregnancy. Women who smoke have a higher chance of an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tubes. Smoking leads to risk factors of damaging and or killing cilia. As cilia degenerate the amount of time it takes for the fertilized egg to reach the uterus will increase. The fertilized egg, if it doesn't reach the uterus in time, will hatch from the non-adhesive zona pellucida and implant itself inside the fallopian tube, thus causing the pregnancy.|$|E
