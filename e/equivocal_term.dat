40|$|Developing economies were {{traditionally}} {{conceived as}} economies where capital was scarce {{with respect to}} labor and land. Capital scarcity was explained by different reasons, such as low domestic savings propensities (the poor were too poor to save and the rich consumed like their counterparts in developed economies), international exploitation (as in theories of imperialism), and so on. Nowadays these theories face the problem of having developing economies actually exporting savings to developed countries. In development theory, as in all macroeconomics, the concept of savings has been diffcult to grasp, with different authors talking at cross purposes. Financing development, in particular, is surrounded by conceptual and analytical inconsistencies, which responds for {{at least part of}} the confusion that reigns in this subdiscipline. This paper tries to dispel some of these confusions by exploring the different meanings of the term "financing" and examining what each one implies for the discussion of overcoming development (itself, in fact, a rather <b>equivocal</b> <b>term,</b> as the paper also suggests). development, financing development, savings,...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} (geological) {{formation}} has gradually developed through mostly German terms: from ein Gebirge, {{which was used}} by Saxon miners for several centuries (AGRICOLA), then Schichten, Bergart (LEHMANN) and serie montana (FUCHSEL) to Gebirgsart (WERNER). The term ‘formation’ was introduced by WERNER in 1791 and its meaning was clearly defined around 1800. He included the notion of “formation” into his system of “geognostic structures”: mineral; rock (layer); formation; Earth’s crust. Therefore, it was an <b>equivocal</b> <b>term</b> from the start. It implied a geological body of certain composition, genesis and superposition (i. e. time of origination). After Werner, the term ‘formation’ was used in different ways, mostly as a synonym for a ‘system’, until 1881 when such use was forbidden. The original Wernerian {{sense of the term}} ‘formation’ (as a unit in geological levels of organisation: mineral-rock-formation-geosphere-planet) with an intentionally equivocal meaning was not restored until {{the second half of the}} twentieth century...|$|E

The <b>equivocal</b> <b>term</b> ‘critical’ is shown to function in overcritique in particular as a political code word for a generalised commitment to eliminating all forms of unequal power balances between interdependent groups, which relations are prejudged as subjugation, oppression or domination. Overcritique is shown to be one-sided, over-abstract, destructive and socially iatrogenic, based on dubious transcendental arguments and overstated to the point of absurdity.

40|$|Since the 1950 s, public {{discourse}} in India has been replete {{with references to}} ‘black money’. This generally denotes undeclared or illicit income, sometimes in foreign accounts. Under post-independence socialist rule – so as to circumvent taxes, controls, and regulations – black money pervaded ordinary exchange and political financing. Today, important purchases have white and black ratios, and public figures vow to retrieve black money in Swiss accounts. Black money is, at once, a means to transact business, a barometer of value, an elusive spectre, and a moral outrage. It suggests how money can be differentiated, converted, corrupted, and disguised. Based on an ethnographic study of a popular neighbourhood in central Mumbai, I focus on a ration shop operator’s generation of black money from the diversion of publicly subsidized goods, the surrounding community’s moral critiques, and the owner’s conduits for his income. Black money can be understood in <b>equivocal</b> <b>terms.</b> As a moral critique rooted in notions of injustice and corruption, it acquires a spectral and pernicious character.

These {{obviously}} and {{at first}} blush appear to contain no instruction in them; for when we affirm the said term of itself, whether it be barely verbal, or whether it contains any clear and real idea, it shows us nothing but what we must certainly know before, whether such a proposition be either made by, or proposed to us. Indeed, that most general one, WHAT IS, IS, may serve sometimes to show a man the absurdity he is guilty of, when, by circumlocution or <b>equivocal</b> <b>terms,</b> he would in particular instances deny the same thing of itself; because nobody will so openly bid defiance to common sense, as to affirm visible and direct contradictions in plain words; or, if he does, a man is excused if he breaks off any further discourse with him.

This plan I say, required an uncommon degree of firmness, when we consider that some of those persons who might be of the greatest use in promoting the repeal, violently withstood the declaratory act; and they who agreed with administration in the principles of that law, equally made, as well the reasons on which the declaratory act itself stood, as those on which it was opposed, grounds for an opposition to the repeal.|$|R

However, workplace studies remain <b>equivocal</b> in <b>terms</b> of their effectiveness, {{which may be}} partly owing to whether the PC remains on the skin. OBJECTIVES: To assess the practicability of using skin occlusion testing in a workplace as a method to determine whether PCs applied under controlled conditions can reduce skin damage against known irritants. This study also compares two methods of skin evaluation: clinical dermatological assessment and bioengineering techniques. METHODS: Daily occlusion testing for 1 h (over two consecutive weeks) was conducted in an engineering company on the volar forearm of 21 healthy volunteer engineers with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and a PC that was used on site. The engineers conducted their normal work activities during the occlusion testing period. The skin areas tested were assessed using transepidermal water loss (TEWL), Chroma Meter and by visual dermatological scoring. RESULTS: Testing with PC and SLS together showed that PC does not prevent irritant contact dermatitis but significantly reduced skin damage compared with SLS alone (P < 0. 01). The changes in skin were evident earlier with the biophysical measurements {{when compared with the}} dermatological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Occlusion testing is a useful method for assessing the potential effectiveness of protective creams and {{can be used in a}} workplace without affecting work practices.

40|$|BACKGROUND Although {{psychotherapy}} {{generally is}} effective in anxiety disorders, many patients are treatment-resistant. At the same time, some patients with anxiety disorders show alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, {{one of the major}} stress-responsive systems. Since raised levels of the end product of the HPA axis, cortisol, adversely affect cognition, we hypothesised that more pronounced alterations in cortisol levels would be associated with a less favourable response to psychotherapy. More specifically, the higher patients' basal levels and the lower their levels during exposure, the less likely we expected them to profit from treatment. METHODS We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO to review the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the relationship between pre-treatment cortisol and psychotherapy response. Records were included if they studied patients with any anxiety disorder undergoing psychotherapy, with a pre-treatment cortisol and a post-treatment symptom measure. Correlation coefficients were extracted for meta-analyses. RESULTS We identified six studies (N= 274). No relationship between patients' basal cortisol and post-treatment symptoms was found (p= 0. 981). The systematic review showed higher cortisol during exposure sessions to predict better outcomes. Meta-analysis did not confirm this (p= 0. 603). CONCLUSIONS Basal cortisol did not seem to predict psychological therapy responses in patients with anxiety disorders. By contrast, the current state of research is <b>equivocal</b> in <b>terms</b> of whether higher cortisol concentrations during exposure sessions are linked with better treatment outcomes, and {{more research is needed to}} investigate this...|$|R

As such, we utilized an obesity-prone (OP) rat model to investigate how physical activity affects whole body energetics and metabolism as well as adipose tissue-specific changes during the juvenile period. Male OP rats were obtained at 4 wks of age and randomized {{into one of the}} following three groups (n= 10 /group) : 1) high-fat diet (HFD), sedentary (Sed), 2) HFD exercise (Ex), or 3) HFD weight-matched (WM).

40|$|DSDP Leg 82 drilled nine {{sites to}} the {{southwest}} of the Azores Islands on the west flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) {{in an attempt to}} determine the temporal and spatial evolution of the Azores "hot-spot" activity. The chemistry of the basalts recovered during Leg 82 is extremely varied: in Holes 558 and 561, both enriched (E-type: CeN/YbN = 1. 5 to 2. 7; Zr/Nb = 4. 5 to 9. 6) and depleted (or normal-N-type: CeN/YbN = 0. 6 to 0. 8; Zr/Nb > 20) mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) occur as intercalated lava flows. To the north of the Hayes Fracture Zone, there is little apparent systematic relationship between basalt chemistry and geographic position. However, to the south of the Hayes Fracture Zone, the chemical character of the basalts (N-type MORB) is more uniform. The coexistence of both E-type and N-type MORB in one hole may be explicable in terms of either complex melting/ fractionation processes during basalt genesis or chemically heterogeneous mantle sources. Significant variation in the ratios of strongly incompatible trace elements (e. g., La/Ta; Th/Ta) in the basalts of Holes 558 and 561 are not easily explicable by processes such as dynamic partial melting or open system crystal fractionation. Rather, the trace element data require that the basalts are ultimately derived from at least two chemically distinct mantle sources. The results from Leg 82 are <b>equivocal</b> in <b>terms</b> of the evolution of the Azores "hot spot," but would appear not to be compatible with a simple model of E-type MORB magmatism associated with upwelling mantle "blobs. " Models that invoke a locally chemically heterogeneous mantle are best able to account for the small-scale variation in basalt chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Unhealthy {{diet and}} {{low levels of}} {{physical}} activity are common behavioural factors in the aetiology of many non-communicable diseases. Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of policy and research interest in the use of taxes and other economic instruments to improve population health. To assemble, configure and analyse empirical research studies available to inform the public health case for using economic instruments to promote dietary and physical activity behaviour change. We conducted a systematic scoping review of evidence for the effects of specific interventions to change, or general exposure to variations in, prices or income on dietary and physical activity behaviours and corollary outcomes. Systematic electronic searches and parallel snowball searches retrieved > 1 million study records. Text mining technologies were used to prioritise title-abstract records for screening. Eligible studies were selected, classified and analysed in terms of key characteristics and principal findings, using a narrative, configuring synthesis focused on implications for policy and further research. We identified 880 eligible studies, including 192 intervention studies and 768 studies that incorporated evidence for prices or income as correlates or determinants of target outcomes. Current evidence for the effects of economic instruments and exposures on diet and physical activity is limited in quality and <b>equivocal</b> in <b>terms</b> of its policy implications. Direct evidence for the effects of economic instruments is heavily skewed towards impacts on diet, with a relative lack of evidence for impacts on physical activity. The evidence-based case for using economic instruments to promote dietary and physical activity behaviour change may be less compelling than some proponents have claimed. Future research should include measurement of people's actual behavioural responses using study designs capable of generating reliable causal inferences regarding intervention effects. Policy implementation needs to be carefully aligned with evaluation planning and design...|$|R

The full version is available for consultation at the University of Leicester Library. It has been increasingly recognised that there are costs to caring for health professionals who help individuals who have experienced trauma within their work. There has also been recognition, in recent years, that there are factors that may have an influence on positive or negative effects of the work for these professionals. A review of relevant literature found that whilst there are interesting developments in the area, methodologies have had several limitations and results have been <b>equivocal</b> in <b>terms</b> of identifying factors of influence. There {{is a lack of}} UK-based studies, and none which focus exclusively on Clinical Psychologists as a professional group. The thesis attempts to build on the previous evidence base, with an exclusive focus on the positive and negative effects of a Clinical Psychologists work on their well-being. These are conceptualised as Secondary Traumatisation and Adversarial Growth, and measures chosen accordingly. A National Survey design is used targeting Clinical Psychologists throughout the UK, recruited through BPS DCP email lists. Particular factors of social support, organisational support, team support and the supervisory alliance are focused on and their relation to outcomes. In addition, use of primary therapeutic model is assessed against outcomes, using hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Findings suggest that Clinical Psychologists are experiencing Secondary Traumatisation and Adversarial Growth, though the latter perhaps at lower levels than may be expected. There were not significant findings in relation to the specific factors explored, but trends are discussed, overall implications from the findings, and reflection on the research process...|$|R
60|$|It is {{reckoned}} ill manners, {{as well as}} unreasonable, for men to quarrel upon {{difference in}} opinion; because that is usually {{supposed to be a}} thing which no man can help in himself; which however I do not conceive to be an universal infallible maxim, except in those cases where the question is pretty equally disputed among the learned and the wise; where it is otherwise, a man of tolerable reason, small experience, and willing to be instructed, may apprehend he is got into a wrong opinion, though the whole course of his mind and inclination would persuade him to believe it true: He may be convinced that he is in error though he does not see where it lies, by the bad effects of it in the common conduct of his life, and by observing those persons for whose wisdom and goodness he has the greatest deference, to be of a contrary sentiment. According to Hobbes's comparison of reasoning with casting up accounts, whoever finds a mistake in the sum total, must allow himself out, though, after repeated trials he may not see in which article he has misreckoned. I will instance in one opinion, which I look upon every man obliged in conscience to quit, or in prudence to conceal; I mean, that whoever argues in defence of absolute power in a single person, though he offers the old plausible plea, that, it is his opinion, which he cannot help unless he be convinced, ought, in all free states to be treated as the common enemy of mankind. Yet this is laid as a heavy charge upon the clergy of the two reigns before the Revolution, who under the terms of Passive Obedience and Non-Resistance are said to have preached up the unlimited power of the prince, because they found it a doctrine that pleased the Court, and made way for their preferment. And I believe there may be truth enough in this accusation, to convince us, that human frailty will too often interpose itself among persons of the holiest function. However, it may be offered in excuse for the clergy, that in the best societies there are some ill members, which a corrupted court and ministry will industriously find out and introduce. Besides, it is manifest that the greater number of those who held and preached this doctrine, were misguided by <b>equivocal</b> <b>terms,</b> and by perfect ignorance in the principles of government, which they had not made any part of their study. The question originally put, and as I remember to have heard it disputed in public schools, was this; whether under any pretence whatsoever it may be lawful to resist the supreme magistrate? which was held in the negative; and this is certainly the right opinion. But many of the clergy, and other learned men, deceived by dubious expression, mistook the object to which passive obedience was due. By the supreme magistrate is properly understood the legislative power, which in all government must be absolute and unlimited. But the word magistrate seeming to denote a single person, and to express the executive power, it came to pass, that the obedience due to the legislature was for want of knowing or considering this easy distinction, misapplied to the administration. Neither is it any wonder, that the clergy or other well-meaning people should fall into this error, which deceived Hobbes himself so far, as to be the foundation of all the political mistakes in his book, where he perpetually confounds the executive with the legislative power, though all well-instituted states have ever placed them in different hands, as may be obvious to those who know anything of Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and other republics of Greece, as well as the greater ones of Carthage and Rome.|$|R
