5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did not see a child among the self-immolators. The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and security was tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored public access to the square <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church in deference to the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

25|$|Information: Preparations {{for seeing}} {{in the new year}} were {{originally}} undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer {{the end of the month}} now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over the front door to prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree sprigs, beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana ("year shelf"), is piled high with kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year,</b> and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for New Years Day, {{which also}} celebrated {{the naming of}} Jesus eight days after his birth, were from the Epistle to the Galatians, [...] "by faith we inherit" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the Circumcision and naming of Jesus (...) [...] The text was written by Picander and published in 1728 {{in a collection of}} texts for all occasions of the liturgical year. Picander included for the first movement a verse from Psalm 48 ( [...] in the King James version, otherwise verse 11). He used as the closing chorale the second stanza from Johannes Hermann's hymn [...] "". Picander's poetry is focused on the name of Jesus, similarly to Bach's later cantata for the same occasion, Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio. The biblical quotation from the Old Testament already mentions the name of God. The first recitative adds the thought that the name of Jesus is a gift <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year.</b> The second aria contemplates that the name of Jesus, being the first word in the new year, should also be the last in the hour of death. [...] The last recitative refers to , of Jesus saying: [...] "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you." [...] The final movement combines prayers and hopes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

500|$|Dryden's successor, Thomas Shadwell, was {{appointed}} in 1689 for life. He introduced {{the custom of}} producing poems <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>year</b> and the monarch's birthday, which {{became one of the}} key duties of the position. After the appointment of William Wordsworth in 1843 the duties settled into an expectation, not requirement, for major court and national occasions. Alfred, Lord Tennyson held the post between November 1850 and October 1892. According to Andrew Motion and Hilary Laurie, Tennyson [...] "gave the poet laureateship new status and significance" [...] with works such as [...] "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington" [...] and [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade". On his death the post was left vacant as a mark of respect; a new laureate was not appointed until four years later, with the appointment of Alfred Austin in January 1896. As at 2015 the position is an honorary one, and the office holder is left to decide on which occasions they will produce poetry. Following Dryden's dismissal from the post, the laureateship was held for life by all successors until Motion {{was appointed}} in 1999 for a fixed term of ten years; his successor, Carol Ann Duffy, was also appointed on the same fixed term. Duffy is the first female poet to hold the role, and the first Scot.|$|E
