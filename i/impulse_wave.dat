5000|$|When a {{stretched}} wire string is excited into motion by plucking or striking, a complex wave travels outward {{to the ends}} of the string. As it travels outward, this initial impulse forces the wire out of its resting position all along its length. After the impulse has passed, each part of the wire immediately begins to return toward (and overshoot) its resting position, which means vibration has been induced. Meanwhile, the initial impulse is reflected at both ends of the string and travels back toward the center. On the way, it interacts with the various vibrations it induced on the initial pass, and these interactions reduce or cancel some components of the <b>impulse</b> <b>wave</b> and reinforce others. When the reflected impulses encounter each other, their interaction again cancels some components and reinforces others.http://www.speech.kth.se/music/5_lectures/ ...|$|E

For Alpine lakes, <b>impulse</b> <b>waves</b> are particularly significant, because of steep shores, narrow reservoirs geometry, possible large slide masses, and high impact velocities. Catastrophic events, as the well-known Vajont disaster occurred in Italy in 1963 {{which led to the}} loss of more than 2000 human lives, promoted the study of the physical process and the possible consequences of this phenomenon. The present analysis is based on an experimental research performed on a 1 : 190 physical scale model in laboratory, which allows to simulate the entire phenomenon, from the landslide movement to the dam overtopping. The main objective {{of this study is to}} gain more knowledge about the landslide generated <b>impulse</b> <b>waves</b> in reservoirs by trying to find a general modelling that, despite the phenomenon complexity, could help in the prediction of potential disaster effects. With this aim, experiments have been conducted by modifying the landslide location, the altitude of fall, its shape and volume, and by investigating two different dam freeboards. The research is initially focused on the simple observation of generated <b>impulse</b> <b>waves</b> amplitude and propagation in the basin, water height on the dam crest and total overtopping water volume. Subsequently, it proceeds with a dimensional analysis, based on the identified phenomenon governing parameters.

Therefore, the study of slope failures, the subsequent generation of <b>impulse</b> <b>waves</b> and their consequences are of paramount importance for safety. In this paper the generation and propagation of water waves in reservoirs induced by landslides and their impact on banks were investigated by means of a laboratory study carried out at University of Coimbra wave channel, in a flume measuring 12. 0 m ? 1. 5 m ? 1. 0 m (L ?

The study considered the sliding of calcareous blocks over a sliding slope bank into the reservoir, the generation of <b>impulse</b> <b>waves,</b> their propagation in the reservoir and their impact on the downstream bank. A number of waves were generated by different fallings of calcareous blocks, considering different volumes, sliding slopes, initial positions and reservoir depths.

The water surface variations due to transient waves were measured at five gauges placed between the banks.

Mostly the protection of electrical power depends {{on the performance of}} insulation systems under transient over voltage conditions arises due to lightening and switching applications. Transient over voltages in addition to the abrupt changes in the state of power systems, e. g. switching operations or faults are known as switching impulse voltages and that due to lightening are known as lightening impulse voltages. Very short pulse high-voltage or high-current surges can be produced by an electrical apparatus known as impulse generator. High impulse voltages are used to test the durability of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. The Marx Impulse generator is used to generate such high impulse voltages. A total of eight stages of both Standard as well as Improved Marx Impulse generator were designed and the impulse waves were recorded.

40|$|A rocky {{granular}} flow {{is commonly}} formed after {{the failure of}} rocky bank slopes. An <b>impulse</b> <b>wave</b> disaster may also be initiated if the rocky granular flow rushes into a river with a high velocity. Currently, the granular mass–water body coupling study is an important trend {{in the field of}} landslide-induced impulse waves. In this paper, a full coupling numerical model for landslide-induced impulse waves is developed based on a non-coherent granular flow equation, i. e., the Mih equation. In this model, the Mih equation for continuous non-coherent granular flow controls movements of sliding mass, the two-phase flow equation regulates the interaction between sliding mass and water, and the renormalization group (RNG) turbulence model governs the movement of the water body. The proposed model is validated and applied for the 2014 Tangjiaxi landslide of the Zhexi Reservoir located in Hunan Province, China, to analyze the characteristics of both landslide motion and its following impulse waves. On 16  July  2014, a rocky debris flow was formed after the failure of the Tangjiaxi landslide, damming the Tangjiaxi stream and causing an <b>impulse</b> <b>wave</b> disaster with three dead and nine missing bodies. Based on the full coupling numerical analysis, the granular flow impacts the water with a maximum velocity of about 22. 5  m s − 1.
