5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets {{led to another}} ambiguity in defining a planet: {{the point at which}} a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to <b>fuse</b> deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter <b>fuse</b> hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can <b>fuse</b> deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E

5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently hot to <b>fuse</b> carbon to neon, {{and then to}} <b>fuse</b> neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to <b>fuse</b> carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to <b>fuse</b> neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to <b>fuse</b> when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that <b>fuse</b> to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus striatus can {{reproduce}} both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis), {{typical of}} taxa in the basidiomycetes that contain both haploid and diploid stages. Basidiospores {{produced in the}} peridioles each contain a single haploid nucleus. After the spores have been dispersed into a suitable growing environment, they germinate and develop into homokaryotic hyphae, with a single nucleus in each cell compartment. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups <b>fuse</b> with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. After {{a period of time}} and under the appropriate environmental conditions, fruiting bodies may be formed from the dikaryotic mycelia. These fruiting bodies produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new spores are made. Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which <b>fuse,</b> and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce haploid basidiospores. The process of meiosis in C.striatus {{has been found to be}} similar to that of higher organisms.|$|E
5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries.

5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} hot to <b>fuse</b> helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become sufficiently hot to <b>fuse</b> carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of <b>fused</b> image displays called hybrid <b>fused</b> displays. Such displays can be created by gradually transforming a <b>fused</b> image computed by one fusion method into another <b>fused</b> image computed by a different fusion method, either in the spatial domain or in another domain. By defining either global image-to-image or local region-toregion mapping(s) between the two key <b>fused</b> displays, sequences of hybrid <b>fused</b> displays can be generated. In this paper we propose a number of global and local inbetweening algorithms which transform pixel-based <b>fused</b> displays into various region-based <b>fused</b> displays. The main motivation behind this research is that while pixel-based <b>fused</b> displays generally provide better situational awareness, region-based <b>fused</b> displays, such as cut-andpaste displays or pseudo-coloured segmentation maps, often lead to better performance in tasks such as target detection and tracking. Having the ability to generate hybrid displays between these two classes is essential for being able to evaluate their perception, performance and usefulness for various tasks in different scenarios and applications...|$|R
