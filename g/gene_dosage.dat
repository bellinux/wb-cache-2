25|$|The {{existence}} of genes along the inactive X {{which are not}} silenced explains the defects in humans with abnormal numbers of the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome (X0) or Klinefelter syndrome (XXY).

In affected individuals, however, X-inactivation is incomplete and the dosage of these non-silenced genes will differ as they escape X-inactivation, similar to an autosomal aneuploidy.|$|E

25|$|Currently it {{is unknown}} which {{mechanism}} {{gave rise to the}} initial duplication of the amylase gene, and it can imply that the insertion of the retroviral sequences was due to non-homologous end joining, which caused the duplication of the AMY1 gene. However, there is currently no evidence to support this theory and therefore this hypothesis remains conjecture. The recent origin of the multi-copy AMY1 gene implies that depending on the environment, the AMY1 gene copy number can increase and decrease very rapidly relative to genes that do not interact as directly with the environment. The AMY1 gene is an excellent example of how <b>gene</b> <b>dosage</b> affects the survival of an organism in a given environment. The multiple copies of the AMY1 gene gives those who rely more heavily on high starch diets an evolutionary advantage, therefore the high gene copy number persists in the population.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that copy number {{variations}} are significantly more common in genes that encode proteins that directly interact with the environment than proteins {{that are involved in}} basic cellular activities. It was suggested that the <b>gene</b> <b>dosage</b> effect accompanying copy number variation may lead to detrimental effects if essential cellular functions are disrupted, therefore proteins involved in cellular pathways are subjected to strong purifying selection. In addition, proteins function together and interact with proteins of other pathways, therefore it is important to view the effects of natural selection on bio-molecular pathways rather than on individual proteins. With that being said, it was found that proteins in the periphery of the pathway are enriched in copy number variations whereas proteins {{in the center of the}} pathways are depleted in copy number variations. It was explained that proteins in the periphery of the pathway interact with fewer proteins and so a change in protein dosage affected by a change in copy number may have a smaller effect on the overall outcome of the cellular pathway.|$|E

We hypothesized that deletion of NFKBIA (encoding nuclear factor of kappa-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-alpha), an inhibitor of the EGFR-signaling pathway, promotes tumorigenesis in glioblastomas {{that do not have}} alterations of EGFR. Methods We analyzed 790 human glioblastomas for deletions, mutations, or expression of NFKBIA and EGFR. We studied the tumor-suppressor activity of NFKBIA in tumor-cell culture. We compared the molecular results with the outcome of glioblastoma in 570 affected persons. Results NFKBIA is often deleted but not mutated in glioblastomas; most deletions occur in nonclassical subtypes of the disease. Deletion of NFKBIA and amplification of EGFR show a pattern of mutual exclusivity. Restoration of the expression of NFKBIA attenuated the malignant phenotype and increased the vulnerability to chemotherapy of cells cultured from tumors with NFKBIA deletion; it also reduced the viability of cells with EGFR amplification but not of cells with normal <b>gene</b> <b>dosages</b> of both NFKBIA and EGFR. Deletion and low expression of NFKBIA were associated with unfavorable outcomes. Patients who had tumors with NFKBIA deletion had outcomes that were similar to those in patients with tumors harboring EGFR amplification.

40|$|Abstract Background The fourth {{component}} of human complement (C 4), an essential factor of the innate immunity, is represented as two isoforms (C 4 A and C 4 B) in the genome. Although these genes differ only in 5 nucleotides, the encoded C 4 A and C 4 B proteins are functionally different. Based on phenotypic determination, unbalanced production of C 4 A and C 4 B {{is associated with}} several diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, several autoimmune diseases, moreover with higher morbidity and mortality of myocardial infarction and increased susceptibility for bacterial infections. Despite of this major clinical relevance, only low throughput, time and labor intensive methods have been used so far for the quantification of C 4 A and C 4 B genes. Results A novel quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) technique was developed for rapid and accurate quantification of the C 4 A and C 4 B genes applying a duplex, TaqMan based methodology. The reliable, single-step analysis provides {{the determination of the}} copy number of the C 4 A and C 4 B genes applying a wide range of DNA template concentration (0. 3 – 300 ng genomic DNA). The developed qPCR was applied to determine C 4 A and C 4 B <b>gene</b> <b>dosages</b> in a healthy Hungarian population (N = 118). The obtained data were compared to the results of an earlier study of the same population. Moreover a set of 33 samples were analyzed by two independent methods. No significant difference was observed between the <b>gene</b> <b>dosages</b> determined by the employed techniques demonstrating the reliability of the novel qPCR methodology. A Microsoft Excel worksheet and a DOS executable are also provided for simple and automated evaluation of the measured data. Conclusion This report describes a novel real-time PCR method for single-step quantification of C 4 A and C 4 B genes.

The genes that are closer to the origin site would be replicated first and would consequently be present in two copies in the cell for a longer time than the genes that are closer to the termination site.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{structural}} variants {{in the human}} genome that have been observed but have not led to any obvious phenotypic effects. There are some, however, that {{play a role in}} <b>gene</b> <b>dosage</b> which could lead to genetic diseases or distinct phenotypes. Structural variants can directly affect gene expression, such as with copy-number variants, or indirectly through position effects. These effects can have significant implications in susceptibility to disease. The first <b>gene</b> <b>dosage</b> effect that was observed, and considered to be an autosomal dominant disease from an inherited DNA rearrangement, was Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) disease. Most of the associations found with CMT were with a 1.5 Mb tandem duplication in 17p11.2-p12 at the PMP22 gene. The proposed mechanism for the structural variation is shown in Figure 2. When an individual has three copies of the normal gene, it results in the disease phenotype. If the individual had only one copy of the PMP22 gene, on the other hand, the result was a clinically different heredity neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. The differences in <b>gene</b> <b>dosage</b> created vastly different disease phenotypes which revealed the significant role that structural variation has on phenotype and susceptibility to disease.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{animals with}} {{heteromorphic}} sex chromosomes, dosage compensation of sex-chromosome genes {{is thought to}} be critical for species survival. Diverse molecular mechanisms have evolved to effectively balance the expressed dose of X-linked genes between XX and XY animals, and to balance expression of X and autosomal <b>genes.</b> <b>Dosage</b> compensation is not understood in birds, in which females (ZW) and males (ZZ) differ in the number of Z chromosomes. Results Using microarray analysis, we compared the male:female ratio of expression of sets of Z-linked and autosomal genes in two bird species, zebra finch and chicken, and in two mammalian species, mouse and human. Male:female ratios of expression were significantly higher for Z genes than for autosomal genes in several finch and chicken tissues. In contrast, in mouse and human the male:female ratio of expression of X-linked genes is quite similar to that of autosomal <b>genes,</b> indicating effective <b>dosage</b> compensation even in humans, in which a significant percentage of genes escape X-inactivation. Conclusion Birds represent an unprecedented case in which genes on one sex chromosome are expressed on average at constitutively higher levels in one sex compared with the other. Sex-chromosome dosage compensation is surprisingly ineffective in birds, suggesting that some genomes can do without effective sex-specific sex-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn {{mammalian}} females, two X chromosomes are epigenetically distinguished {{as active}} and inactive chromosomes to balance X-linked <b>gene</b> <b>dosages</b> {{between males and}} females. How the Xs are maintained differently in the same nucleus remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the inactive X (Xi) is targeted to a distinct nuclear compartment following pairing with its homologous partner. During mid-to-late S phase, 80 %– 90 % of Xi contact the nucleolus and reside within a Snf 2 h-enriched ring. Autosomes carrying ectopic X-inactivation center sequences are also targeted to the perinucleolar compartment. Deleting Xist results {{in a loss of}} nucleolar association and an inability to maintain Xi heterochromatin, leading to Xi reactivation at the single gene level. We propose that the Xi must continuously visit the perinucleolar compartment to maintain its epigenetic state. These data raise a mechanism by which chromatin states can be replicated by spatial and temporal separation in the nucleus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Z and W sex {{chromosomes}} {{of birds}} have evolved independently from the mammalian X and Y chromosomes [1]. Unlike mammals, female birds are heterogametic (ZW), while males are homogametic (ZZ).

Other animals with nonhomologous sex chromosomes possess “dosage compensation” systems to equalize the expression of sex-linked <b>genes.</b> <b>Dosage</b> compensation occurs in animals as diverse as mammals, insects, and nematodes, although the mechanisms involved differ profoundly [2]. In birds, however, it is widely accepted that dosage compensation does not occur [3 – 5], and the differential expression of Z-linked genes has been suggested to underlie the avian sex-determination mechanism [6]. Here we show equivalent expression of at least six of nine Z chromosome genes in male and female chick embryos by using real-time quantitative PCR [7].

40|$|The {{abundance}} of detected ancient polyploids in extant genomes raises questions regarding evolution after whole-genome duplication (WGD). For instance, what rules govern the preservation {{or loss of}} the duplicated genes created by WGD? We explore this question by contrasting two possible preservation forces: selection on relative and absolute <b>gene</b> <b>dosages.</b> Constraints on the relative dosages of central network genes represent an important force for maintaining duplicates (the dosage balance hypothesis). However, preservation may also result from selection on the absolute {{abundance of}} certain gene products. The metabolic network of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a powerful system for comparing these hypotheses. We analyzed the surviving WGD-produced duplicate genes in this network, finding evidence that the surviving duplicates from the most recent WGD (WGD-α) are clustered in the network, as predicted by the dosage balance hypothesis. A flux balance analysis suggests an association between the survival of duplicates from a more ancient WGD (WGD-β) and reactions with high metabolic flux. We argue for an interplay of relative and absolute dosage constraints, such that the relative constraints imposed by the recent WGD are still being resolved by evolution, while they have been essentially fully resolved for the ancient event...|$|R
