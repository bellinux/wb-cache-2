40|$|The {{conventional}} {{processes for}} acid gas removal (AGR), including CO 2 in the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation facilities are: a chemical process, using methyl-diethanolamine (MDEA); a physical process, using chilled methanol (Rectisol) or a physical process, using mixtures of <b>dimethylethers</b> of polyetheleneglycol (Selexol). These conventional processes require cooling {{of the fuel}} gas streams for CO 2 capture and subsequent reheating before sending to turbines, which decreases the plant thermal efficiency and increases the overall cost. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing an economical process which can capture CO 2 from the hot fuel gas stream without significant cooling. The overall objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the potential use of physical solvents for selective capture of CO 2 from post water-gas-shift streams under relatively elevated pressures and temperatures. In order to achieve this objective, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to define an “ideal solvent” for CO 2 capture and to identify six different physical solvents which should obey such a definition. The first physical solvents identified were perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which are known to have low reactivity, high chemical stability and relatively low vapor pressures. Three different PFCs, known as PP 10, PP 11, and PP 25, were selected as potential candidates for CO 2 capture. The equilibrium solubilities of CO 2 and N 2 were measured in these PFCs under different operating conditions up to 30 bar and 500 K. These PFCs have relatively low viscosity at 500 K, very good thermal and chemical stabilities and showed high CO 2 solubilities; hence they were considered as “ideal solvents. ” The CO 2 solubilities in PP 25 were found to be greater than in the other two PFCs. Due to its superior behavior, PP 25 was selected for the development of a conceptual process for CO 2 capture form Pittsburgh No. 8 shifted fuel gas mixture using Aspen Plus simulator. Unfortunately, during the pressure-swing option for solvent regeneration, the solvent loss was significant due to the fact that the boiling point of PP 25 is 533 K which is close to the absorber temperature (500 K). Also, other drawbacks of PFCs include, high cost, and absorption of other gases (light hydrocarbons) along with CO 2. It was then decided to seek different physical solvents, which have negligible vapor pressure, in addition to the other attractive properties of the “ideal solvent” in order to use in the Aspen Plus simulator. Extensive literature search led to Ionic Liquids (ILs), which are known to have unique properties in addition to extremely low vapor pressures, and therefore they were considered excellent candidates for the CO 2 capture from fuel gas streams under elevated pressures and temperatures. Three ILs, namely TEGO IL K 5, TEGO IL P 9 and TEGO IL P 51 P, manufactured by Evonik Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation, were selected as potential solvents for CO 2 capture. The solubilities of CO 2, H 2, H 2 S and N 2 were measured in the TEGO IL K 5 and the solubilities of CO 2 and H 2 were measured in the TEGO IL K 5 at pressures up to 30 bar and temperatures from 300 to 500 K. Also, the density and viscosity of these three ILs were measured within the same pressure and temperature ranges, and the surface tension for TEGO IL K 5 and TEGO IL P 51 P were measured from 296 to 369 K. Due to their superior performance for CO 2 capture, the TEGO IL K 5 and the TEGO IL P 51 P were selected to be used in the Aspen simulator for the conceptual process development. The density and surface tension data for the TEGO IL K 5 and the TEGO IL P 51 P were used in Aspen Plus, employing the Peng-Robinson Equation of state (P-R EOS) to obtain the critical properties of the two ILs; and the measured solubility data were also used to obtain the binary interaction parameters between the shifted gas constituents and two ILs. The Aspen Plus simulator was employed to develop a conceptual process for CO 2 capture from a shifted fuel gas stream (102. 52 kg/s) generated using Pittsburgh # 8 coal for a 400 MWe power plant. The conceptual process developed consisted mainly of 4 adiabatic absorbers (2. 4 m ID) arranged in parallel and packed with Plastic Pall Rings of 0. 025 m for CO 2 capture; 3 flash drums arranged in series for solvent regeneration using the pressure-swing option; and 2 pressure-intercooling systems for separating and pumping CO 2 to the sequestration sites. The compositions of all process steams, CO 2 capture efficiency, and net power were calculated using Aspen Plus for each solvent. The results indicated that, based on the composition of the inlet gas stream to the absorbers, 87. 6 and 81. 42 mol...|$|R

From the perspective of methanol stability Sb 2 O 3 showed the best performance, destroying only 3 of the methanol feed at 500 Â°C. The majority of oxides totally combusted methanol below 400 Â°C. The oxides MoO 3, Nb 2 O 5, Ta 2 O 5 and WO 3 all produced high methanol conversion, however, high selectivities towards formaldehyde and <b>dimethylether</b> were obtained with only low levels of carbon oxides throughout the range of conversions. The products formaldehyde and <b>dimethylether</b> were desirable by-products from a methane partial oxidation process hence these oxides are suitable catalyst components. The activation of methane has been probed by the exchange reaction with deuterium under non-oxidative conditions. The most active catalyst was Ga 2 O 3 which exhibited normalised exchange rates several orders of magnitude greater than the other catalysts. A relationship between the rate of methane activation and the predicted basic strength of the rare earth sesquioxides was established. This relationship indicates that methane activation took place via the abstraction of H+ to form a surface methyl carbanion species. On the basis of these results we have designed and tested a limited range of two component oxide catalysts for methane partial oxidation.

X-Ray crystal structures show minimal multiple bonding in the indole examples and a measurable shortening of the pyridine- 2 -ylidene Pt–C distance (1. 959 (3) A) compared with typical Pt–C bonds (2. 01 (1) A). The kinetics of associative DMSO substitution trans to the pyridine- 2 -ylidene ligand indicate a stabilization of the trigonal bipyramidal transition structure that is due to pi-acidity of the carbene carbon. This pi-acidity is responsible for 4 -orders of magnitude acceleration in the associative substitution rate compared with a structurally similar phenyl donor. The relative rates of methane, methanol and <b>dimethylether</b> C–H activation by [(N-N) PtMe(TFE-d 3) ]+ ((N-N) = ArN=C(Me) -C(Me) =NAr Ar = 3, 5 -di-tert-butylphenyl, TFE-d 3 = CF 3 CD 2 OD) were studied by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy.

Deuterium scrambling studies indicate that displacement of TFE-d 3 from the platinum center by methane's C–H bond is slower than the subsequent C–H oxidative cleavage and hence the rate-determining step in methane C–H activation. The kinetics of methanol and <b>dimethylether</b> C–H activation were studied with 1 H NMR spectroscopy and shown to be inhibited by a preequilibrium binding of the substrates oxygen lone-pair to the metal center. A small kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 1. 4 ± 0. 1) and the observed concentration dependence suggest that the reaction proceeds by rate determining displacement of the coordinated trifluoroethanol by the C-H bonds of methanol (k = 2. 0 ± 0. 2 x 10 - 3 M- 1 s- 1, Keq = 0. 0042 ± 0. 0006, 330 K).

The obtained product spectrum is wide, i. e. saturated, unsaturated and oxygen-functional hydrocarbons. The generally observed methane conversion levels are 6 – 20 % at a conversion efficiency of about 100 – 250 nmol J- 1. The main products are ethane, ethylene and acetylene. Higher saturated hydrocarbons up to C 6 have been detected. The observed oxygen-functional hydrocarbons are methanol, ethanol and lower concentrations of aldehydes, ketones, <b>dimethylether</b> and methylformate. Methanol seems to be exclusively produced with CH 4 /O 2 mixtures at a maximum production efficiency of 0. 35 nmol J- 1. CH 4 /CO 2 mixtures appear to yield higher hydrocarbons. Carboxylic acids appear to be mainly present in the aqueous reactor phase, possibly together with higher molecular weight species...|$|E
