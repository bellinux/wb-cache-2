With more time in hand, the team was able to implement more sophisticated drive control, allowing power to be directed to each wheel independently (instant torque vectoring), improving traction and handling. Total power was increased to 536 bhp and 885 lb ft of torque. The onboard energy storage was increased to 50KWH, and top speed increased to at least 140 mph. The design also featured improved aerodynamics, reduced weight, a lower centre of gravity due to repositioning the batteries, active yaw control, active stability control and a redesigned anti-lock braking system.

In this study, we compared the morphometry and compound eye characteristics of three species of the genus Siagona: S. jenissoni, S. dejeani and S. europaea. These carabids have a stenotopic lifestyle in Mediterranean clayey soils, inhabiting the ground fissure system formed during the dry season. All species have a Mediterranean distribution and are nocturnal olfactory hunters, and are strict ant predators. For morphometric measurements, we considered body length (mm), wing length (mm), antenna length (mm), head width (mm), trochanter length (mm), number of ommatidia, eye surface area (mm 2), ommatidia density (number of ommatidia/mm 2 of eye surface area), head <b>height</b> (<b>mm),</b> thorax <b>height</b> (<b>mm)</b> and abdomen <b>height</b> (<b>mm).</b> The data revealed intersexual and interspecific differences. The three species differ in relative length of the antennae, density and number of ommatidia and relative trochanter length. Significant differences occurred in wing sizes, which are well developed in S. europaea, the only species capable of flight. When eye size is compared with other ground beetles of various lifestyles, Siagona shows pronounced “microphthalmy” an adaptation to subterranean life in clayey crevices of tropical and subtropical climates with a marked dry season...|$|E

The neutral suspension casting technique is a commonly utilised method for obtaining a negative impression of the foot prior to orthotic fabrication. Digital scanning offers an alternative to the traditional plaster of Paris techniques. Methods Twenty one healthy participants volunteered {{to take part in the}} study. Six casts and six digital scans were obtained from each participant by two raters of differing clinical experience. The foot parameters chosen for investigation were cast length (mm), forefoot width (mm), rearfoot width (mm), medial arch <b>height</b> (<b>mm),</b> lateral arch <b>height</b> (<b>mm)</b> and forefoot to rearfoot alignment (degrees). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the intra and inter-rater reliability. Measurement error was assessed through the calculation of the standard error of the measurement (SEM) and smallest real difference (SRD). Results ICC values for all foot parameters using digital scanning ranged between 0. 81 - 0. 99 for both intra and inter-rater reliability. For neutral suspension casting technique inter-rater reliability values ranged from 0. 57 - 0. 99 and intra-rater reliability values ranging from 0. 36 - 0. 99 for rater 1 and 0. 49 - 0. 99 for rater 2.

The paper presents new experimental data on flow and breakdown of a liquid film driven {{by the action of}} a forced gas flow in a horizontal minichannel (2 mm high), heated from a 22 x 6. 55 mm heater. A map of isothermal flow regimes is plotted and the lengths of smooth region and region of 2 D/ 3 D wave occurrence are measured. The scenario of liquid film breakdown under heating is found to differ widely for different flow regimes. It is revealed that the critical heat flux at which film breakdown occurs for a shear-driven liquid film can be several times higher than that for a gravitationally-driven liquid film. This fact makes shear-driven liquid films very promising in high heat flux cooling applications.

Eighty Japanese quail were divided to receive four inclusion levels of ascorbic acid. A completely randomized design was used and the results were submitted to analysis of variance. The differences observed were analyzed by regression at a 5 % level of significance. The addition of 0, 0. 01, 0. 02 % and 0. 03 % ascorbic acid to the diet of quail did not influence dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI) or crude protein intake (CPI), expressed as g/animal/day, g/kg 0. 75 and % body weight. Mean DMI, OMI and CPI were 46. 53, 44. 0 and 11. 0 g/animal/day, respectively. However, there was a quadratic effect on neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI). Maximum NDFI was 9. 19 g/animal/day for the inclusion level of 0. 01 % ascorbic acid in the diet of laying Japanese quail. The addition of ascorbic acid to the diet of laying quail did not alter (P> 0. 05) egg production or productivity, with a mean egg production of 3. 06 eggs/cage/day and 0. 77 eggs/animal/day and mean productivity of 76. 5 %. The addition of 0, 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 % ascorbic acid also did not alter egg weight (g), yolk and albumen weight (g), or egg and yolk diameter (mm). However, the addition of ascorbic acid to the quail diet exerted a quadratic effect (P< 0. 05) on egg <b>height</b> (<b>mm)</b> and shell weight (g). The lowest egg height and shell weight were 2. 99 mm and 1. 25 g, respectively, for inclusion levels of 0. 017 % and 0. 023 % ascorbic acid in the quail diets.

40|$|AbstractA new flow {{injection}} chemiluminescence {{system is}} developed for determination of anions like sulphate. The method {{is based on}} the displacement of an equivalent amount of bromide ion on a Br− from an ion-exchange minicolumn by sulphate. The released Br− then reacts with 				BrO 3 − in acidic medium to produce bromine water which catalyzes the Luminol/H 2 O 2 chemiluminescence. Working conditions for these determinations were optimized. The emission intensities produced were recorded as peak <b>height</b> (<b>mm)</b> on a chart recorder and they were proportional to the amount of sulphate injected. This method allowed determination of 0. 96 mg/l 				SO 42 −. The developed FIA-CL system was applied for determination of sulphate in water (well and waste water) in different regions in Erbil City – North of Iraq. Interference effects of various anions were eliminated by inserting a suppressor minicolumn in the FIA-CL system after injection port, which allowed for sulphate only to pass through. The method provided a very simple, rapid and sensitive method for sulphate determination without any pretreatment. The present method was applied for sulphate and could be used for other ions with some improvement in the suppressor column...|$|E

Light-curing was performed at 600 mW/cm² for 40 s, three times along the 25 mm specimens, twice along 15 mm specimen and once for the 10 mm specimens. Specimens of all dimensions were light-cured on both surfaces, or only on one side. In the latter, the load was applied on the irradiated side or on the opposite one. RESULTS: It was shown that the flexural strength was not affected by specimen length. When light-curing was performed on both surfaces, similar flexural strength values were obtained for any dimension. Despite the number of irradiated surfaces, specimens with a height of 1 mm also obtained similar values. On the contrary, specimens with a height of 4 mm, exposed only on one surface, reached the lowest strength. CONCLUSION: The use of specimens with lower dimensions can lead to flexural strength values similar to the ones obtained with standardized specimen (ISO 4049), with the advantage of demanding less amount of material and being less time consuming...|$|E
