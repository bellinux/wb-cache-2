So it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photo-reconnaissance and had to be {{withdrawn}} from escort duties. And the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, [...] "the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Schur. This episode was the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Producer Greg Daniels said {{the idea for the}} actual Office Olympics stemmed from The King of the Hill Office Olympics, which were created and ran by Daniel's former assistant Tim Croston and the show's two production assistants at the time: Tony Gennaro and Seranie Manoogian. The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices are doing it all over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games. The Yogurt Lid Medals reappear in the third season finale, [...] "The Job": Receiving the lid and a note from Pam is the catalyst for Jim's decision between Pam and Karen.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, {{staff writer}} Al Jean {{commented on the}} episode: [...] "The idea of it to parody EC Comics was really {{original}} and kind of shocking for a cartoon on network television. [...] Jim Brooks said, 'We better have a disclaimer {{at the beginning of}} this Halloween show,' so Marge came out and warned people that they were going to see something scary. And the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> it's now very tame by our Halloween standards and by network animation standards." [...] According to M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television, the warning only made the episode more attractive to children. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film Frankenstein. While similar [...] "warnings" [...] were used to open the second and third [...] "Treehouse" [...] episodes, these quickly became a burden to write and there was no warning for the fourth episode. Instead, it had Marge ask Bart to warn people how frightening the show was during his introduction paying homage to Night Gallery. The tradition was revived for [...] "Treehouse of Horror V"; after that, they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them. In the opening segment of the episode, and the four subsequent episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous television season and celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison. They were last used in [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", which included a solitary tombstone with the words [...] "Amusing Tombstones" [...] to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Of the series, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the only one that included a treehouse as a setting. [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a theremin (an early electronic musical instrument), but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.|$|E
500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> last year we were saying the same things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E

Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> a lot of people want them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually." [...] Hansis said that [...] "it does throw you a bit, especially since this was [...] first big role on television" [...] and [...] "You go from waiting tables to doing interviews with national magazines and people saying that you changed their lives. It's definitely tricky".|$|E

2500|$|One track, the folk-tinged {{acoustic}} song [...] "Too Good to Be", was {{not written}} until {{the latter part}} of recording, only being penned in minutes whilst in the studio. Jordan Pundik joked that, [...] "the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> that's the song you'd think we wrote sitting on a beach around a fire." [...] While all the songs were primarily written on guitar, Chad Gilbert also tracked melodies on piano, despite his limited ability on the instrument. Gilbert explained that, [...] "When we wrote the songs a couple of songs started out on piano, like the melodies. So in pre-production, I did the piano. But I'm not very good, I can write melodies, but I just use two fingers, my pointer fingers." [...] Panunzio subsequently brought in Benmont Tench (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) to play the keyboard, piano and organ parts throughout the album. Paul Buckmaster conducted string sections for [...] "When I Die" [...] and [...] "Boulders", while indie rock band Eisley, comprising three sisters including Gilbert's then-fiancée Sherri DuPree, provided female backing vocals for seven tracks on the album. Once the process of mixing and mastering the record had finalised, the band asked Autumn de Wilde, best known for her portraiture and commercial photography of musicians, to shoot the cover art and liner photography for the album booklet. Chad Gilbert later declared that he was [...] "really proud", citing the music as [...] "the most uplifting" [...] the band had ever written, while Pundik added that Coming Home would be [...] "the one that will stand the test of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production {{just a little too}} refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but that seems like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E
