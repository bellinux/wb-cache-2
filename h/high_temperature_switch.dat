Specifically, actuation of the SCIC system includes two portions. The portion which isolates the MCO and initiates the safety-class helium (SCHe) purge, and the portion which detects and stops excessive heat input to the MCO annulus on high Tempered Water (TW) inlet temperature. For the MCO isolation and purge, the SCIC receives MCO pressure (both positive pressure and vacuum), helium flow rate, bay <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>switch</b> status, seismic trip status, and time-under-vacuum trips signals. The SCIC system will isolate the MCO and start an SCHe system purge if any of the following occur. (1) Isolation and purge from one of the SCHe ''isolation'' and ''purge'' buttons is manually initiated (administratively controlled). (2) The first vacuum cycle exceeds 8 hours at vacuum, or any subsequent vacuum cycle exceeds 4 hours at vacuum without re-pressurizing the MCO for a minimum of 4 hours. (This {{is referred to as the}} 8 / 4 / 4 requirement and provides thermal equilibrium within the MCO.) (3) MCO is below atmospheric pressure and the helium flow is below the minimum required to keep hydrogen less than 4 % by volume. (When MCO pressure is below 12 torr there is insufficient hydrogen to exceed the 4 % level and therefore no purge is required. A five minute time delay on low flow allows flow to be stopped in order to reach < 12 torr.) (4) The duration for the transition from above atmospheric pressure to vacuum (time to reach pressure below - 11. 7 psig [{approx} 155 torr]) exceeds 5 minutes. (5) The duration for the transition from vacuum (below - 11. 1 psig [{approx} 185 torr]) back to pressure [greater than 0. 5 psig] exceeds 5 minutes. (6) MCO reaches a vacuum state (< 0. 5 psig) without an adequate, verified purge volume. (The MCO must be maintained above atmospheric pressure (approximately 0. 5 psig) to prevent oxygen ingress unless a purge of adequate volume has been completed. During bulk water draining, the MCO must remain above atmospheric pressure.) (7) Seismic event of sufficient magnitude is detected. (Trip point is below the Uniform Building Code levels). Setpoint determination is required for trips C through H. Sensor error determination for additional safety-significant sensors used by the HVAC system or the SCHe system are also required...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{magnetization}} dynamic {{process in}} nano-scale magnetic systems {{is of great}} scientific interests for its application to magnetic recording technology and spintronic devices. In the dynamic process, thermal fluctuation effects are of critical importance since they {{are directly related to}} long term reliability of magnetic devices. Recently, a novel approach to modeling stochastic magnetization dynamics has been proposed[1, 2, 3]. In this approach, thermal bath effects are accounted for by introducing a jump-noise torque term into the precessional magnetization dynamics equation. In this dissertation, we develop a Monte Carlo type numerical technique for implementation of the approach. There are two central elements of our numerical technique: a ``midpoint'' finite-difference scheme for integration of deterministic precessions and a ``self-scattering'' scheme which results in time-homogenization of a jump-noise process. The numerical technique unconditionally preserves the micromagnetic constraint and appreciably simplifies the random component of Monte Carlo simulations. We perform and illustrate numerous Monte Carlo simulations in the dissertation using numerical examples. The Monte Carlo simulations are ideally suited for implementation on GPUs since they are intrinsically parallelizable in the sense that different realizations of stochastic magnetization dynamics can be computed concurrently. Therefore we develop a parallel algorithm and implement it using an Nvidia GPU card. A speed-up factor of more than 200 is achieved using this GPU implementation in comparison with the tranditional CPU single threaded implementation. Furthermore, we apply the jump-noise process driven magnetization dynamic equation to study random magnetization switching induced by thermal fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate that the magnetization switching rate has a very different temperature dependence at relatively high and very low <b>temperatures.</b> The <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>switching</b> conforms to the Arrhenius law of thermal activation, whereas the low <b>temperature</b> <b>switching</b> has many features traditionally attributed to the phenomenon of macroscopic magnetization tunneling. The two temperature dependent regimes emerge directly from the properties of a jump-noise process while no quantum considerations are involved in our approach. Finally, we study the magnetization dynamics at elevated temperatures. We extend the jump-noise process driven magnetization dynamics approach and derive a generalization of the classical Landau-Lifshitz equation to describe magnetization dynamics around Curie temperature where the traditional micromagnetic constraint is not valid. The longitudinal and transverse damping terms in the generalized equation emerge directly from the mathematical structure of a jump-noise process which accounts for interactions with thermal bath...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{cellular}} responses to temperature fluctuations in plants is the adjustment {{in the degree}} of membrane unsaturation. Glycerolipids are major constituents of cellular membranes. In higher plants, glycerolipids are synthesized via two major metabolic pathways compartmentalized in the ER and chloroplast. Adaptive responses in membrane lipids include alterations in fatty acid desaturation, proportional changes in membrane lipids as well as molecular composition of each lipid species. In this study, I systematically explored the significance of glycerolipid pathway balance in temperature induced lipid composition changes in three plant species that have distinctive modes of lipid pathway interactions through a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches including lipidomics and RNA-seq analysis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a 16 : 3 plant, low temperature induces an augmented prokaryotic pathway, whereas <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> enhances the eukaryotic pathway. Atriplex lentiformis reduces its overall lipid desaturation at <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> and <b>switches</b> lipid phenotype from 16 : 3 to 18 : 3 through drastically increasing the contribution of the eukaryotic pathway as well as suppression of the prokaryotic pathway.

In Triticum aestivum, an 18 : 3 plant, low temperature leads to a reduced glycerolipid flux from ER to chloroplast.

40|$|Superconducting {{switches}} {{may find}} application in superconducting magnet systems that require energy extraction. Such superconducting switches could be bypass-switches that are operated {{in conjunction with}} a parallel resistor or dump-switches where all of the energy is dissipated in the switch itself. Bypass-switches are more suited to higher energy circuits as a portion of the energy can be dissipated in the external dump resistor. Dump- switches require less material and triggering energy as a lower switch resistance is needed to achieve the required total dump resistance. Both superconducting bypass-switches and superconducting dump-switches can be ther- mally activated. Switching times that are comparable to those obtained with mechanical bypass-switch systems can be achieved using a co-wound heater that is powered by a ca- pacitor discharge. Switches that have fast thermal diffusion times through the insulation can be modelled as a lumped system whereas those with slow thermal diffusion times were modelled with the full heat diffusion equation. Superconducting switches can be formed of either <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> superconductors (HTS) or low <b>temperature</b> superconductors (LTS). <b>Switches</b> based on HTS materials allow operation at <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> where the cost of cooling is less.

Finally, experimental irradiations were performed on W-Schotthy diodes and mesa-MESFET devices (with the same Schottky gate than the planar SiC MESFET) in order to study their radiation hardness stability. The good radiation endurance of SiC Schottky-gate devices is proven. It is expected that the new developed devices with the same W-Schottky gate, to have a similar behavior in radiation rich environments. Postprint (published version...|$|R

This paper presents the comparative performance evaluation of different SiC power devices in matrix converter at various <b>temperatures</b> and <b>switching</b> frequencies. To this end, firstly, gate or base drive circuits for Normally-off SiC JFET, SiC MOSFET and SiC BJT which {{taking into account}} the special demands for these devices are presented. Then, three 2 -phase to 1 -phase matrix converters are built with different SiC power devices to measure the switching waveforms and power losses for them at different <b>temperatures</b> and <b>switching</b> frequencies. Based on the measured data, three different SiC power devices are compared in terms of switching times, conduction and switching losses and efficiency at different <b>temperatures</b> and <b>switching</b> frequencies. Furthermore, a theoretical investigation of the power losses of three phase matrix converter with Normally-off SiC JFET, SiC MOSFET, SiC BJT and Si IGBT is described. The power losses estimation indicates that a 7 KW matrix converter would potentially have an efficiency of approximately 96 % in high switching frequency if equipped with SiC devices...|$|R
40|$|Isoprene {{emission}} from broadleaf trees {{is highly}} temperature dependent, accounts {{for much of}} the hydrocarbon emission from plants, and has a profound effect on atmospheric chemistry. We studied the temperature response of postillumination isoprene emission in oak (Quercus robur) and poplar (Populus deltoides) leaves {{in order to understand the}} regulation of isoprene emission. Upon darkening a leaf, isoprene emission fell nearly to zero but then increased for several minutes before falling back to nearly zero. Time of appearance of this burst of isoprene was highly temperature dependent, occurring sooner at <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures.</b> We hypothesize that this burst represents an intermediate pool of metabolites, probably early metabolites in the methylerythritol 4 -phosphate pathway, accumulated upstream of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP). The amount of this early metabolite(s) averaged 2. 9 times the amount of plastidic DMADP. DMADP increased with temperature up to 35 °C before starting to decrease; in contrast, the isoprene synthase rate constant increased up to 40 °C, the <b>highest</b> <b>temperature</b> at which it could be assessed. During a rapid <b>temperature</b> <b>switch</b> from 30 °C to 40 °C, isoprene emission increased transiently. It was found that an increase in isoprene synthase activity is primarily responsible for this transient increase in emission levels, while DMADP level stayed constant during the switch. One hour after switching to 40 °C, the amount of DMADP fell but the rate constant for isoprene synthase remained constant, indicating that the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> falloff in isoprene emission results from a reduction in the supply of DMADP rather than from changes in isoprene synthase activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of low voltage and high voltage circuits on SiC has profound applications. SiC power devices have proved their superiority {{in terms of}} <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> operation, faster <b>switching</b> frequencies and larger power densities when compared with Si power devices. The control of SiC power devices however, lies {{in the hands of}} low voltage circuits built on Si. Thus, there exists a separation in the overall system between the low voltage and high voltage side, which increases system cost, weight and reduces efficiency. With the advancement in low voltage SiC processing technology, low voltage control circuits can be made on the same die as power devices, and power systems will become compact, robust and more efficient. A new low voltage process in 4 H-SiC has been characterized and modeled. In order to design circuits with the low voltage process, designers need accurate device models for simulation. Currently, there exist no compact models in the public domain for low voltage SiC MOSFETs. This work aims at filling that void, by providing a modified PSP model for SiC MOSFETs. In addition, a new compact model for SiC power MOSFETs has also been developed and validated with characterization data from a commercially available 1200 V, 20 A power MOSFET. A gate driver chip has been designed and fabricated in 4 H-SiC using the developed models. The gate driver chip will drive commercially available power MOSFETs in an integrated AC/DC converter application...|$|R

40|$|Phase slips are topological {{fluctuation}} {{events that}} carry the superconducting order-parameter field between distinct current carrying states. Owing to these phase slips low-dimensional superconductors acquire electrical resistance. In quasi-one-dimensional nanowires {{it is well}} known that at <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> phase slips occur via the process of thermal barrier-crossing by the order-parameter field. At low temperatures, the general expectation is that phase slips should proceed via quantum tunnelling events, which are known as quantum phase slips (QPS). Here we report strong evidence for individual quantum tunnelling events undergone by the superconducting order-parameter field in homogeneous nanowires. We accomplish this via measurements of the distribution of switching currents-the high-bias currents at which superconductivity gives way to resistive behaviour-whose width exhibits a rather counter-intuitive, monotonic increase with decreasing temperature. We outline a stochastic model of phase slip kinetics which relates the basic phase slip rates to switching rates. Comparison with this model indicates that the phase predominantly slips via thermal activation at <b>high</b> <b>temperatures</b> but at sufficiently low <b>temperatures</b> <b>switching</b> is caused by individual topological tunnelling events of the order-parameter field, i. e., QPS. Importantly, measurements on several wires show that quantum fluctuations tend to dominate over thermal fluctuations at larger temperatures in wires having larger critical currents. This fact provides strong supports the view that the anomalously high switching rates observed at low temperatures are indeed due to QPS, and not consequences of extraneous noise or hidden inhomogeneity of the wire.
