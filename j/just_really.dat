5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. I thought it was such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and <b>just</b> <b>really</b> brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm <b>just</b> <b>really</b> popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

They just came in and they were <b>just</b> <b>really</b> polite and very thankful, and then when they turned on the amps and made that noise, it was just unbelievable that it was coming from them.|$|E

25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was <b>just</b> <b>really</b> inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

I think as far as artists reinventing themselves, she did it before anybody else. She kind of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

[...] He was aiming to finish it that fall. In 2013, three years after production began, Hollywood Blvd., USA was released to festivals.

[...] Comparing his approach to that of Pujols and Adrian Gonzalez, McGwire also commented that [...] "Matt's very strong mentally. [...] I can’t emphasize enough how this game is a mental grind.

There's {{something}} very vulnerable about it and something very defiant about it, especially the way [...] sings it. The first verse is vulnerable—'You tell me it's going to get better?'—and the second verse comes in and it builds. Really? It gets better? No. You don't know until it happens to you...|$|E

Reznor told Kerrang! in a later interview, [...] "When I was on the [...] tour, to keep myself busy I <b>just</b> <b>really</b> hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it." ...|$|E

[...] Danny Goffey added, [...] "They're the sort of people who don't fit in anywhere, who don't link up with everyday life at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{stated that}} she wanted to film the video to {{showcase}} the correlation of physical beauty and happiness in life, which serves as one of the song's themes. Speaking to MTV News, the singer mentioned: [...] "It represents all of the things women go through {{to keep up with the}} pressure that society puts on us. I wanted to tap into the world of competition. Some of the things young women go through is <b>just</b> <b>really</b> heartbreaking for me." [...] Matsoukas wanted [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] to follow a premise reminiscent to that of a documentary, with most of its filming occurring organically and unplanned.

Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that I really love to get it down to time. [...] It will be <b>just</b> <b>really</b> interesting content-wise for us [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline.
