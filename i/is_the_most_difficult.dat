5|$|The 400-year period {{following}} {{the collapse of}} Roman rule <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> to interpret {{in the history of}} Wales. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples. Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades, some previously maintained that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic, or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas.|$|E

It is also particularly effective in the later stages of an innings in one-day cricket, because it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of all deliveries to score off even if defended successfully. Runs will often only be scored off edges or straight down the ground.|$|E

25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich Körner (36 victories) also {{recognised}} this as unique: [...] "Shooting {{in a curve}} (deflection shooting) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> thing a pilot can do. The enemy {{flies in}} a defensive circle, that means they are already lying in a curve and the attacking fighter has to fly into this defensive circle. By pulling his aircraft right around, his curve radius must be smaller, {{but if he does}} that, his target disappears in most cases below his wings. So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E

[...] He finally came to the conclusion that, in spite of orders that limited him to the Carolinas, he would best serve the British cause by going to Virginia to join his army with that of Phillips and Arnold. [...] Writing after the campaign, he explained that he did not feel he could effectively support Lord Rawdon, who he had left in command in South Carolina, and that he would be unable to gain control of North Carolina until Virginia had been pacified. [...] Since he had not received instructions from Clinton in some time, he wrote the general a letter specifically requesting direction: [...] "I am very anxious to receive your Excellency's commands, being as yet totally in the dark as to the intended operations of the summer. [...] I cannot help expressing my wishes that the Chesapeak may become the seat of war [...] North Carolina [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> of provinces to attack."
