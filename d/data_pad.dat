Several data sources are included for the computations; these include 7447 terrestrial free-air gravity anomalies, 10243 altimeter derived gravity anomalies and 692881 mean digital elevation heights. The EGM 96 global geopotential model to degree 40 is used in order to determine the long wavelength effect of the Co-geoid surface. Co-geoid undulations are determined through implementation of the remove-restore technique by combining the above-mentioned data sets with the geopotential model in a specific manner. The computations have been done using a two-dimensional spherical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with 100 % zero padding. Terrain corrections are also computed using the FFT method and applied in the remove-restore technique. The absolute accuracy estimates are given for the Co-geoid undulations using 95 GPS control stations co-located with third order levelling.

The computation and data prefetching are balanced in the partition schedule, such that the long memory latency can be hidden efficiently. Multiple loop partition scheduling explores parallelism among computations, and exploit the data locality between different loop nests as well in each loop nest. <b>Data</b> <b>padding</b> is applied in our technique to eliminate the cache interference, which overcomes the problem of cache conflict misses arisen from loop partition.

A new class of technologies - physical activity <b>data</b> (<b>PAD)</b> devices - promises to afford statistics learners with precisely this kind of data and may thereby enhance statistics learning. In this study, three undergraduate learners were invited to wear a Fitbit One activity tracker for a week and a half, prior to participating in a study group session in which they explored their data using data visualization software. The study produced evidence that there were important statistical realizations made by the participants that were uniquely enabled by the use of self-data in the learning process, and that participants felt that the use of self-data enhanced the learning experience.

Objective: To determine the relationship between DM status with PAD status in patients with hypertension Methods: This study is an observational analytic research with cross sectional design using purposive sampling method. There were 38 hypertensive subjects without DM and 40 hypertensive subjects with DM at ages ranging from 40 to 60 years. The data used are primary data and secondary <b>data.</b> <b>PAD</b> status is determined by examining Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) using a stethoscope at rest and post-exercise.

Results: There were 18 subjects (45 %) having positive PAD status in hypertension group with DM, and 8 subjects (21. 1 %) in hypertension without DM. Chi-square test showed significant association between DM Status and PAD status in patients with hypertension (p < 0. 025).
