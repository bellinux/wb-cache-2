5|$|Many critics {{repeatedly}} {{asserted that}} she was calling <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with {{an awareness of the}} chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{flexible}} fuel car {{is built}} with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for {{starting the engine}} with pure ethanol in cold weather, used in earlier ethanol-only vehicles, was kept in {{the first generation of}} Brazilian flexible-fuel cars, mainly for users of the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below. An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 that allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> of this secondary gas reservoir tank.|$|E

On the February 17 episode of Raw, Christian attacked Daniel Bryan from behind while he was distracted by Kane and mocked Bryan during the match, making him a heel. At Elimination Chamber, Christian eliminated Sheamus before being eliminated himself by Bryan. On the March 24 episode of Raw, Christian won a fatal four-way match including Alberto Del Rio, Dolph Ziggler and Sheamus to challenge Big E for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, which {{did not come to}} fruition due to Christian suffering a concussion and this was his final match.|$|E
5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> of the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E

5|$|On the February 1, 2013, {{episode of}} SmackDown, Swagger returned, {{and demanded that}} SmackDown General Manager Booker T {{put him in the}} Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. Later on that night, Swagger made his in-ring return by {{defeating}} Kofi Kingston. On the February 11 episode of Raw, Swagger debuted a new manager, Zeb Colter, a self-proclaimed great American hero who strongly advocated anti-immigration beliefs; Swagger's character was influenced by Colter to display similar traits. That same episode, Swagger defeated Zack Ryder to qualify <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elimination</b> Chamber match that would determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship which he also won after last eliminating Randy Orton.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the show was that each main event match was to be contested as an Elimination Chamber match. The Elimination Chamber is a {{circular}} steel cage, consisting of chains and girders, that surrounds the ring. Four 'pods' are enclosed within the chamber, one behind each ring post, which are on a steel platform surrounding {{the outside of the}} ring. Six wrestlers compete in the match; four are enclosed within the pods and released at random at specific time intervals, and two start the match. Wrestlers can only be eliminated via pinfall or submission, and the last wrestler left is the winner. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elimination</b> Chamber pay-per-view, both WWE world championships, the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship, were to be defended in separate Elimination Chamber matches.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft {{proposed}} the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting {{the entire population of}} occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elimination</b> of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at the thought that the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
5|$|The pre-show {{featured}} one match, the New Japan Rumble. Tiger Mask and Yuji Nagata {{began the}} match, with new wrestlers entering each minute. Wrestlers worked to eliminate each other, {{and the last}} remaining wrestler won. In this match, eliminations could occur via pinfall, submission, disqualification, or being {{thrown out of the}} ring over the top rope. The Great Kabuki, Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and Hiro Saito were surprise entrants. Captain New Japan was the first eliminated when Tama Tonga threw him over the top rope. Sho Tanaka and Yohei Komatsu worked together to eliminate Taichi and Tiger Mask. After Tanaka was eliminated by submitting to Manabu Nakanishi's torture rack, Tonga eliminated Nakanishi and Komatsu via pinfall, the latter after a jumping DDT. Yoshi-Hashi threw Tonga over the top rope <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination,</b> leaving himself and Nagata in the match. Nagata won the match by slamming Hashi against the mat with a belly-to-back suplex, bridging into a pinfall elimination at 26 minutes and 9 seconds.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elimination</b> of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) {{defeated}} Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, {{they were}} {{given the opportunity to}} be in charge of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit’s shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to Edge to submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elimination</b> Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} matches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elimination</b> Chamber event {{consisted}} of two Elimination Chamber matches, with Raw's WWE Championship defended in one and SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship defended in the other. Qualifying matches were held on the February 1 episode of Raw to determine the five challengers who would face the WWE Champion Sheamus in Raw's Elimination Chamber match. In qualifiers, John Cena defeated Cody Rhodes, Triple H defeated Jack Swagger, Randy Orton defeated Shawn Michaels, Ted DiBiase defeated Mark Henry, and Kofi Kingston defeated The Big Show by disqualification. In the weeks prior to Elimination Chamber the participants faced off in several matches, which included DiBiase vs. Cena ending in a no contest, Sheamus defeating Orton by disqualification, DiBiase defeating Kingston via pinfall, and Cena vs. Triple H ending in a no contest due to Sheamus interfering and attacking both participants. The February 5 episode of SmackDown saw the five wrestlers qualify to challenge The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship in a similar fashion. John Morrison defeated Drew McIntyre and Kane in a triple threat match. Throughout {{the rest of the}} episode, this was followed by R-Truth defeating Mike Knox, CM Punk defeating Batista via countout, Chris Jericho defeating Matt Hardy, and Rey Mysterio defeating Dolph Ziggler. In the following weeks, the six wrestlers faced off in different combinations in singles matches that saw Mysterio pin Punk, Morrison vs. R-Truth end in a no contest due to Morrison suffering a storyline ankle injury, and Jericho defeating The Undertaker. On the February 19 episode of SmackDown, Morrison and R-Truth teamed up to face CM Punk and his 'follower' Luke Gallows in a tag team match, which Morrison and R-Truth lost via referee stoppage.|$|E
