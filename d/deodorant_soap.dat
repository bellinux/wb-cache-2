40|$|Purpose: Deodorant {{use during}} {{radiation}} therapy {{for breast cancer}} has been controversial as there are concerns deodorant use may exacerbate axillary skin toxicity. The present study prospectively determined the use of both aluminum-containing and non aluminum containing deodorants on axillary skin toxicity during conventionally fractionated postoperative radiation therapy for breast cancer. Methods and Materials: This 3 -arm randomized controlled study was conducted at a single center, tertiary cancer hospital between March 2011 and April 2013. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 experimental groups (aluminum-containing <b>deodorant</b> and <b>soap</b> or non-aluminum containing <b>deodorant</b> and <b>soap)</b> or a control group (soap). A total of 333 participants were randomized. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate and compare the odds of experiencing high levels of sweating and skin toxicity {{in each of the}} deodorant groups to the odds in the control group. The study evaluated a range of endpoints including objective measurements of axilla sweating, skin toxicity, pain, itch and burning. Quality of life was assessed with a validated questionnaire. Results: Radiation characteristics were similar across all groups. Patients in the deodorant groups did not report significantly different ratings for axillary pain, itch, or burning compared with the control group. Patients in the aluminum-containing deodorant group experienced significantly less sweating than the control; the odds of their sweating being barely tolerable and frequently or always interfering with their daily activities was decreased by 85 % (odds ratio, 0. 15; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 03 - 0. 91). Conclusions: We found no evidence that the use of either aluminum-containing or non-aluminum containing deodorant adversely effects axillary skin reaction during conventionally fractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer. Our analysis also suggests patients in the aluminum-containing deodorant arm had significantly less sweating without increased symptoms of axillary radiation skin toxicity. These results add to the evidence that the prescription of deodorants during radiation therapy for breast cancer is now questionable...|$|R

5000|$|Dial was {{the first}} {{antibacterial}} soap introduced in the United States. It was developed by chemists from Armour and Company and introduced in the Chicago market in 1948. Armour had been producing soap since 1888; soap was made from tallow, a by-product of the meat production process. The name Dial was chosen because the soap advertised [...] "'round-the-clock" [...] protection against the odor caused by perspiration. Demand for this new soap exceeded expectations due to its deodorant effectiveness, its non-medicinal clover-like smell and bright golden yellow color. The brand was rolled out nationally in 1949, and in time became the leading <b>deodorant</b> <b>soap</b> brand in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{commercial}} trichlorocarbanilide-containing <b>deodorant</b> <b>soap</b> and a commercial plain soap upon the cutaneous flora of individuals were compared. Using a cross-over design, 21 volunteers (10 women and 11 men) washed their forearms {{at least once a}} day with one soap for 3 weeks and then switched soaps for another 4 weeks use. By analysis of variance no significant difference in total colony counts was noted among individuals in their use of the two soaps.

However, in 20 of 21 subjects an alteration in the composition of skin flora was observed. The <b>deodorant</b> <b>soap,</b> which in six cases increased total flora, tended to reduce or eliminate diphtheroids in 12 to 17 carriers (71 %). Fewer kinds of bacteria were also noted.
