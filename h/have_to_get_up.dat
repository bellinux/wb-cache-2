5|$|Sahil and Jai {{drive to}} Mahabaleshwar overnight, and upon arrival decide {{to visit the}} local market. Jai is amazed by Sahil's skill as a guitarist and {{suggests}} that he pursue {{a career as a}} fulltime musician. Later, he gifts him a guitar during lunch. The two engage in several arguments and bicker about their plans throughout the trip, while enjoying each other's company nonetheless. Sahil is irked by Jai's indifferent behaviour and finds it annoying that he works even during the trip. Jai too is not pleased with Sahil's continuous badgering. One night, the two get into a heated argument over their differences. Later, Jai embraces Sahil in his bed and tries to kiss him. The latter resists, and asks Jai to go to sleep as they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> early the next morning.|$|E

That when something bad happens, your life is not over. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> You're gonna live. You're gonna to be okay. You're gonna dance again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rationalism {{is often}} contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly these views are not {{mutually}} exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us a posteriori, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge a priori– {{through the use of}} logic– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, [...] "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science." [...] Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification.|$|E
