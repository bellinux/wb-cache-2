[...] The Levant Trilogy, set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> <b>is</b> praised for its detailed description of Simon Boulderstone's desert war experience and the juxtaposition of the Pringles and their marriage with important world events.

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{rationale}} for outside support for democratization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> outlined by Albrecht Schnabel, {{who says that}} the Middle East is a region with strong authoritarian regimes and weak civil society and identifies the democratization dilemma {{in the region as}} the following: a strong civil society is required to produce leaders and mobilize the public around democratic duties, but in order for such a civil society to flourish, a democratic environment and process allowing freedom of expression and order is required in the first place. [...] "If domestic capacities are lacking, external support may be required. Externally supported creation of fragile, yet somewhat functioning institutions is meant to trigger the momentum needed to encourage the evolution of a functioning civil society. The latter will, after a few years of consolidation and post-conflict stability, produce the first wholly internally crafted government. At that time, external involvement, if still provided at that point, can cede." [...] Schnabel argues that democratization in the Middle East must come from both below and above, given that pressure from below will be pointless if the political leadership is opposed to reform, while top-down reform (which has been the norm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East)</b> <b>is</b> not a fruitful endeavor if the political culture in society is not developed.|$|E

2500|$|Advocacy groups, {{governments and}} {{individuals}} use the internet, new media and social media {{to try to}} influence public perceptions of {{both sides in the}} Arab/Palestinian–Israeli conflict. Jerusalem Post writer Megan Jacobs has written [...] "War <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> being waged not only on the ground, but also in cyberspace." [...] While Israeli and Palestinian advocacy websites promote their respective points of view, fierce debate over the Arab–Israeli conflict has embroiled social networking websites and applications with user-generated content, such as Facebook, Google Earth, Twitter and Wikipedia. According to an Associated Press article, Israelis and Palestinians make use of social media to promote [...] "rival narratives" [...] and draw attention to their own suffering to gain international sympathy and backing. However, [...] "distortions and mistakes are instantly magnified on a global scale." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{support of}} Palestinians is {{frequently}} {{due to the}} consideration of them as people of color—Andrew Hacker writes: [...] "The presence of Israel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine." [...] Martin Luther King Jr. criticized this position at the 68th Annual Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative Judaism, [...] "On the Middle East crisis, we have had various responses. The responses of the so-called young militants does not represent {{the position of the}} vast majority of Negroes. There are some who are color consumed and see a kind of mystique in being colored, and anything non-colored is condemned. We do not follow that course in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and certainly most of the organizations {{in the civil rights movement}} do not follow that course." ...|$|E

2500|$|The B-DR {{component}} shows {{a similar}} distribution, but lacks adequate testing {{to the south}} to resolve its most southern extent. DR3-DQ2 is very common in West and North Africa. And B18 is also elevated in N. Africa and Middle East, with peak levels in Italy. However B18 found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> linked to B18-DR11 (DR11 is very common in the Eastern Mediterranean). The level of B18-DR3 peaks in Sardinia but is also very high in the Basque region of Northern Spain. This is one area of Europe where the B18-DR3 level is relatively different from Cw5-B18, as it appears there was a rare recombination event {{in the evolution of}} Cw5-B18-DR3 that lead to the replacement of Cw*0501 with Cw*1201. This might have occurred in northwest Iberia. Sardinia lacks this recombinant. Levels of B18-DR3 in Europe appear to be combinations of the Cw*0501 and Cw*1201 haplotype. For instance, Albania has significant levels of B18-DR3 but lacks Cw5-B18 in significant quantities. In the Dutch and German populations B-DR haplotypes have undergone more intense studies allowing the detection of haplotypes to very low frequencies (0.25% in the Dutch and 0.05% in the Germans) consequently the edge of B18-DR3 haplotype in Europe is evident. Areas where typing lacks resolution are Austria, Slovakia, Czech republic, etc. The levels detectable in these regions may be higher, similar to levels detected in Switzerland during early studies.(See Table-left and Map-left) ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Arab–Israeli conflict, in a January 2012 Republican debate, Romney said, [...] "Well, {{the reason}} that there’s not peace between the Palestinians and Israel is because there is — in the {{leadership}} of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>is</b> not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel.
