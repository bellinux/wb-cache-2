The flux creep is described by a current-voltage law E(j) =Ec(j/ jc) n, from which we show that the levitation force depends on the speed at which the PM approaches or recedes from the HTS, which accounts for the experimentally observed force creep phenomenon.

One of these strategies proposed in the literature is external <b>force</b> feedback <b>loop</b> control.

40|$|Atomic-scale {{stick-slip}} {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} friction processes. It has been observed on layered materials, such as graphite, or ionic crystals, such as NaCl(001). Recently, wearless friction was also observed on clean metallic surfaces, such as Cu(111). The friction force vs. lateral position traces show stick slip with the periodicity of the atomic lattice. The probing tip sticks at certain positions, builts up elastic deformation until a threshold value is reached. Then the tip jumps one unit cell to the next sticking site. Friction <b>force</b> <b>loops</b> show that the energy which is released during one slip is typically 1 eV. The velocity dependence of atomic-scale stick-slip was investigated. A logarithmic dependence of friction as a function of velocity is found. The results are discussed in terms of a Tomlinson model, which takes into account thermal activation. At low velocities, the tip may slip at lower lateral forces because of thermal activation. At higher velocities the probability is lower to overcome the barrier by thermal activation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a novel concept of force control, called virtual force control. The virtual force concept avoids sudden step transition of position control to contact force control resulting in contact force disturbance when a robot end-effector makes {{contact with the}} environment.

The levitation force is highly hysteretic for the approaching and the retreating branches. The saturated current value, magnetization, and levitation force are found to depend strongly on the J/sub c/(B) relations.

40|$|The degradation, modification, and {{stability}} of polymeric surfaces exposed to chemically reactive O 2 and H 2 O-vapor plasmas were investigated. Specifically, {{the effects of these}} plasmas on etching rate, surface morphology, wetting instability, and fluid-holding capability were studied. Wetting instability is reflected by hydrophobic recovery and can be examined by the Wilhelmy balance method. Although hydrophobic recovery is usually attributed to surface configuration change, there are actually two types: reversible and permanent. Reversible hydrophobic recovery is caused by surface configuration change, whereas permanent hydrophobic recovery is caused by the creation of oxidized surface oligomers. This study distinguishes the two by identifying differences in the shapes of the corresponding Wilhelmy <b>force</b> <b>loops</b> and in the fluid-holding parameter. The presence of surface oligomers was most detrimental to wetting stability and fluid-holding capability but could be controlled via the type of reactive gas, the discharge conditions, and the polymer substrate. In general, polymers most susceptible to O 2 -plasma etching had the least surface oligomers and vice versa, whereas H 2 O-vapor plasma suppressed surface oligomers on polymers less susceptible to etching...|$|R

40|$|Transparency {{has been}} a major {{objective}} in bilateral teleoperation systems, {{even in the absence of}} time delay induced by the communication channel, since a high degree of transparency would allow humans to drive the remote teleoperator as if he or she were directly interacting with the remote environment, with the remote teleoperator as a physical and sensorial extension of the operator. When fast convergence of position and force tracking errors are ensured by the control system, then complete transparency is obtained, which would ideally guarantee humans to be tightly kinaesthetically coupled. In this paper a model-free Cartesian second order sliding mode (SOSM) PD control scheme for nonlinear master-slave systems is presented. The proposed scheme does not rely on velocity measurements and attains very fast convergence of position trajectories, with bounded tracking of force trajectories, rendering a high degree of transparency with lesser knowledge of the system. The degree of transparency can easily be improved by tuning a feedback gain in the <b>force</b> <b>loop.</b> A unique energy storage function is introduced; such that a similar Cartesian-based controller is implemented in the master and slave sides. The resulting properties of the Cartesian control structure allows the human operator to input directly Cartesian variables, which makes clearer the kinaesthetic coupling, thus the proposed controller becomes a suitable candidate for practical implementation. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in a semi-experimental setup...|$|E
