"we had two of {{the three}} horses loaded, having put three bushels on each horse...when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the Soldiers {{approaching}} from the south. [...] I said to the Indian boys, 'Here comes the Toquashes (Shoshone for U.S. Soldiers) maybe, you will all be killed. [...] They answered 'maybe the Toquashes will be killed too,' but not waiting for the third horse to be loaded, they quickly jumped upon their horses and led the three horses away, disappearing in the distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{their next}} possession, Baltimore went {{from their own}} 20-yard line to New York's 15-yard line in three plays, aided by Matte's 58-yard run. However, with 2 {{minutes left in the}} half, Morrall was intercepted again, by Sample at the Jets' 2-yard line, deflating the Colts considerably. The Jets then were forced to punt on their ensuing drive, and the Colts {{advanced}} the ball to New York's 41-yard line. What followed {{is one of the most}} famous plays in Super Bowl history. Baltimore tried a flea flicker play, which had a huge impact on the momentum of the game. Matte ran off right tackle after taking a handoff, then pitched the ball back to Morrall. The play completely fooled the NBC Camera Crew, and the Jets defense, leaving receiver Jimmy Orr wide open near the end zone. However, Morrall failed to spot him and instead threw a pass intended for running back Jerry Hill that was intercepted by Jets safety Jim Hudson as time expired, maintaining the Jets' 7â€“0 lead at halftime. Earlier in the season, against the Atlanta Falcons, on the same play, Morrall had completed the same pass for a touchdown to Orr, the play's intended target. [...] "I was the primary receiver," [...] Orr said later. [...] "Earl said he just didn't see me. I was open from here to Tampa." [...] "I'm just a lineman, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Jimmy open," [...] added center Bill Curry. [...] "I don't know what happened." [...] Some speculated that Morrall couldn't see Orr because the Florida A marching band (in blue uniforms similar to the Colts) was gathering behind the end zone for the halftime show.|$|E

60|$|Her smiling eyes {{insisted on}} my {{memories}} being thorough. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> met them squarely, {{a little at}} a loss for what I should say.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{found myself}} nigh Eliot's pulpit, {{at the base}} of which sat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia {{standing}} before them.|$|R
60|$|I was {{somewhat}} annoyed at this effusiveness before the Celebrity, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> caught Mrs. Cooke's eye. It was the calm {{eye of a}} general.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a Franciscan friar {{standing}} by my side. On his back he bore a sack; I supposed he was collecting food.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the Doctor passing us, {{enjoying his}} cigar. He bowed; eyed my pretty {{companion}} with a malicious smile; and passed on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{the monk}} whom I had spoken {{with at the}} inn. He put down his sack and sat by my side.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Sidney is dead,' {{she said}} quietly. 'I saw him--just before <b>I</b> fainted. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> he was {{standing}} between me and you. He had come to say farewell.' ...|$|R
60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{glanced at}} old Indaba-zimbi, {{who was sitting}} near. But it was not till {{afterwards}} that I told Stella of how her vision was brought about.|$|R
6000|$|Dor. Why {{could he}} not find more of us? Pray, sister, [...] Let you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down one day, [...] To find some little ones for us to play with.|$|R
60|$|During our midday halt <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that an {{army was}} {{approaching}} us, five thousand men or more, and asked Kari its meaning.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> an old bald-headed man hobbling {{across the}} churchyard towards me, {{carrying}} a huge bunch of keys {{in his hand}} that shook and jingled at every step.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the sound}} of Agatha's voice and the rustle of her dress which {{restored}} me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> her blue eyes, so full of tenderness and pity, gazing down at me.|$|E
60|$|A. I {{am sorry}} {{to have to say}} this, but just as I had {{finished}} and was restoring the bag to its place, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> there stood Father Peter behind me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{found her}} with her eyes on Verrall. [...] "You see," [...] she said, [...] "I like Willie. It's {{hard to say what}} one feels--but I don't want him to go away like that." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had come}} close to my chair, and was leaning down, so that his head nearly touched mine. Really, when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>I</b> {{thought that he was}} going to take me into his arms. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> laughed softly into his face.|$|R
60|$|The latch of {{the gate}} clicked. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a tall thin {{young man in a}} frock coat and silk hat enter the garden. It was the first time I had seen the costume in the country.|$|E
6000|$|My slight impulse of {{irritation}} {{at such a}} description applied {{to one of my}} wedding guests passed when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the person to whom Mr. Bundercombe had directed my attention. I recognized the adequacy of the wording." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{one day in}} particular; we were sewing in my room. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that Miriam's work had dropped on her knee and she was leaning forward, her lips apart, her eyes gazing upward with an unearthly expression.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{perceived}} for {{the first}} time on the ledge, thirty feet above me, another trail parallel with my own, and looking down upon me through the buckeye bushes a small man on a black horse.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> {{stopped in}} mid-sentence. The {{darkness}} had given place to that bluish light again. The door was opening, and several noiseless Selenites were {{coming into the}} chamber. I became quite still, staring at their grotesque faces.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{weeks after}} this, while {{talking in a}} company, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{detected}} this same man boring through and through me with his intense eye, and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to speak. The moment I paused, he said: ...|$|R
60|$|So I was pondering, when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Charlotte {{standing}} in the entrance between the court and garden, {{looking at me and}} smiling, as she shaded her eyes with her hand from the sun, and then she ran to me lightly as a lapwing.|$|E
6000|$|... "The woman met me," [...] she continued, [...] "and {{took me a}} {{long way}} from the station to a little house. She tried to take me upstairs. She said you were waiting for me, but <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Captain Horton peeping over the banisters--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Swinging low {{the broad}} hat, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a faint tinge of crimson mantle {{in the face}} of the girl, while again a thrill went through me when she said simply, [...] "Ralph!" [...] for that name had never passed her lips before in my hearing.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> would <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> laugh, {{and love}} and live.|$|R
60|$|I {{inferred}} that on such gala occasions carriages {{were given}} an extra cleaning. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{down the street and}} perceived that there was little choice among the vehicles for hire that lined the curb. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> in my memorandum book for the address of Azalea Adair.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> met {{the full}} liquid orbs of the Hon. Blanche Fitzroy Sackville, {{youngest}} {{daughter of the}} Lord Lieutenant. She blushed deeply. I turned pale and almost fainted. But the cold, sneering tones of a masculine voice sent the blood back again into my youthful cheek.|$|R
60|$|Then {{with a roar}} {{of horror}} the executioners fell on him and he died.

6000|$|Then once a {{flash and}} what I {{thought was a}} gun, until <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a fading trail of greenish light still hanging in the sky.

60|$|It was {{a blessed}} thought! We knew nothing till sunrise, when {{the motion of}} our aquatic cot awakened us. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> beheld Zeke wading toward the shore, and towing us after him by the bark cable. Pointing to the reef, he told us we had had a narrow escape.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly <b>and</b> beheld Dolly {{surrounded}} by a circle of admirers.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> beheld Guy Heavystone bending haughtily {{over the}} saddle, as he {{addressed}} a beautiful brunette. She {{was indeed a}} splendidly groomed and high-spirited woman.
