5|$|Joel Stoffer and Neil Flynn have minor {{roles as}} FBI agents {{interrogating}} Indiana {{in a scene}} following the opening sequence. Alan Dale plays General Ross, who protests his innocence. Andrew Divoff and Pasha D. Lychnikoff play Soviet soldiers. Spielberg cast Russian-speaking actors as Soviet soldiers so their accents would be authentic. Dimitri Diatchenko plays Spalko's right-hand man who battles Indiana at Marshall College. Diatchenko bulked up to 250 pounds to look menacing, and his role was originally minor with ten days of filming. When shooting the fight, Ford accidentally hit <b>his</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> Spielberg liked Diatchenko's humorous looking reaction, so he expanded his role to three months of filming. Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a cemetery guard.|$|E
5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed on <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
25|$|Wesbecker then {{returned}} to the pressroom, where he pulled out his SIG Sauer, put it under <b>his</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> shot himself, ending a shooting spree that had lasted for about half an hour.

25|$|Long Huynh, age 42, a Vietnamese {{immigrant}} whose wife, Lan Ho, was killed. Huynh {{had tried}} to shield her with his body, but a bullet that shattered Huynh's elbow ricocheted, striking and killing his wife. Huynh was wounded three more times: he lost a finger to a shot, {{was hit by a}} bullet in his chest, and another bullet entered <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> exited through his cheek.|$|E
25|$|USS Tantalus (ARL-27) {{was one of}} 39 Achelous-class {{landing craft}} repair ships built for the United States Navy during World War II. Named for Tantalus (a legendary king of Lydia {{condemned}} to stand {{in a pool of}} water up to <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> beneath fruit-laden boughs only to have the water or fruit recede at each attempt to drink or eat), she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name.|$|E
25|$|Snow {{returned}} for the Third Test and tore off Gavaskar's chain and medallion with a bouncer that zipped under <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> made him fall over. He bowled the Indian for 6 {{in the first}} innings and had him lbw for a duck in the second, {{but this was not}} enough to prevent India winning the Test and the series by four wickets. It ended England's run of 26 Tests without loss.|$|E

25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue {{out of his mouth}} with a pair of forceps, {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2008, it was {{announced}} that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> lips following an accidental collision with Tal Ben Haim during training. He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin and missed 22 games due to injuries. He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against Wigan Athletic which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the Champions League final against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a penalty shootout.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} autopsy report in 1950, doctors {{concluded}} that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows {{in the skin}} beneath <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> {{at the sides of}} his neck. There was no mark, however, {{at the back of the}} neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.|$|E

25|$|At 9:52 am, Phillips turned east on Archwood Street {{and took}} cover behind a parked semi-truck where he {{continued}} to fire at the police until his rifle jammed. Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing. He was then shot in the right hand, causing him to drop the pistol. After retrieving it, he placed the muzzle under <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> fired; he was simultaneously shot by a bullet that severed his spine. Officers across the street continued to shoot Phillips' body several times {{while he was on}} the ground. After the firing had stopped, officers in the area surrounded Phillips, cuffed him, and removed his ski mask.|$|E
25|$|Hanyu {{withdrew from}} the 2014 Finlandia Trophy due to back injury. For the 2014–15 Grand Prix season, he was {{selected}} to compete at the 2014 Cup of China and 2014 NHK Trophy. At the Cup of China, Hanyu was second in the short program. The next day, during the free skating warm-up, Hanyu had a collision with China's Yan Han. Hanyu was visibly injured, but decided to compete. He fell five times in the free skating, but scored second and won the silver medal. After the competition, he received stitches {{on his head and}} chin. He flew to Japan for further treatment. He had bruising to <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> head, hurt his midriff and left thigh, and sprained his right ankle. A few days before the NHK Trophy, he announced that he will compete but stated that he wasn't in top form. He struggled in the short program, placing fifth. The next day, he continued to have difficulties but placed third in the free skating, fourth overall. The score just barely, by a 0.15 point margin, earned him a spot to the Grand Prix Final. At the Final, he was first in both the short program (94.08 points) and free skating (194.08 points, a new personal best score and the overall highest free skating score of the season), earning the gold medal. His total score was 34.26 points higher than silver medalist Javier Fernández.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink {{his short}} stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong {{relationship}} of mutual respect and friendship, {{living on the}} same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. [...] "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told Sherwood Anderson, [...] " [...] habitually leads with <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know what I say to those people?" [...] and with a gesture, cupping his hand under <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.|$|E

2500|$|Early in his tenure, Singer {{requested}} the concertmaster’s violin {{to demonstrate a}} passage. Tubaist John Richards recounted the incident: [...] "He tucked it under <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> played four or five bars to show what he wanted. The rest of the string section sat openmouthed at how well he could play." [...] Singer had been a violin soloist and also a violinist in the Philadelphia Orchestra at fourteen years old under Stokowski.|$|E

2500|$|Coonskin uses {{a variety}} of racist caricatures from blackface minstrelsy and darky iconography, {{including}} stereotypes featured in Hollywood films and cartoons. In the book That's Blaxploitation! Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury), Darius James writes that [...] "Bakshi pukes the iconographic bile of a racist culture back in its stupid, bloated face, wipes <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> smiles Dirty Harry style. [...] He subverts the context of Hollywood's entire catalogue of racist black iconography {{through a series of}} swift cross-edits of original and appropriated footage." [...] The film also features equally exaggerated portrayals of white Southerners, Italians, and homosexuals. The depiction of Jewish characters stems from stereotypes portrayed in Nazi propaganda, including The Eternal Jew.|$|E
2500|$|The Tollund Man lay [...] {{away from}} firm ground, buried under {{approximately}} [...] of peat, his body {{arranged in a}} fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened securely under his chin by a hide thong. There was a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1mm length) on <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> <b>and</b> upper lip, suggesting {{that he had not}} shaved on the day of his death.|$|E
2500|$|The third film, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in 1938, {{returned}} to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody, a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at Barnett College), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, {{and the return of}} the infamous Nazi mystics, this time trying to find the Holy Grail. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a bullwhip, the scar on <b>his</b> <b>chin,</b> <b>and</b> his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that [...] "Indiana" [...] is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a buddy movie of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good plot element to drive the next installment.|$|E
