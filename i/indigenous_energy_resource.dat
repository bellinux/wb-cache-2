40|$|Hawaii is {{committed}} to replacing imported oil with <b>indigenous,</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> to enhance the economic and environmental security of the state's citizens. A case study of Hawaii's fuel-energy balance {{by the end of}} the 21 st century which features two scenarios, a [`]Business-as-Usual' energy system, based on imported fossil fuels, and a [`]Renewable-Energy' scenario, based on an alternative energy system consisting entirely of <b>indigenous,</b> renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> is presented. In the year 2100, a projected total energy consumption of approximately 335 million gigajoules would be provided from a hypothetical renewable-energy system of approximately 13 gigawatts-electric of installed capacity. This system would feature methanol-from-biomass to meet liquid fuel requirements for surface transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential sectors; hydrogen via electrolysis in liquid form for air transportation and as a gaseous fuel for industrial purposes; and electricity generated from geothermal, ocean thermal, wind, and photovoltaic sources for all power applications. A comprehensive economic analysis, including capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, air pollution costs for the total fuel cycle of each energy system, and a local multiplier effect factor of 3 Â· 75 per dollar, indicates that between the years of 1987 and 2100 the [`]Business-as-Usual' scenario will have expended approximately $ 600 billion (1986 US dollars), and the [`]Renewable-Energy' scenario will have cost approximately $ 400 billion.

At the same time, the increased global interest is forcing developing countries to choose an energy strategy that either prioritizes domestic consumption or export of <b>energy</b> <b>resources.</b> The strategy a government chooses affects the overall energy security of that country. This thesis seeks to explain why countries pursue energy strategies that focus on domestic consumption of <b>indigenous</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> instead of export. To answer this question, case studies of the energy sectors of Tanzania and Mozambique analyze the factors influencing the choice of energy strategy. This thesis finds that the primary factors influencing energy strategy choice are political party competition, the country's economic strategy, and international relationships. Analysis of the case studies indicates that the combination of political elite cohesion, economic reforms that favor the domestic energy market, and structuring the influence of international actors in policy development enables the development of the domestic energy sector.

The first energy and power planning study was conducted in late 1960 s and since then various studies were undertaken to supplement five yearly medium term development plans of government. However, it is pertinent to mention that formal energy and power policies were only announced from 1994 onwards owing to growing electricity demand and progressing industrialization. Beside this, the focus of these policies is not only varied but were conceived without undertaking integrated energy planning using energy modeling tools e. g.
