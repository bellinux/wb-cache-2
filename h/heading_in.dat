5|$|Although Batman Returns was a {{financial}} success, Warner Bros. felt the film {{should have made}} more money. The studio decided to change {{the direction of the}} Batman film series to be more mainstream. Joel Schumacher replaced Tim Burton as director, while Burton decided to stay on as producer. However, Michael Keaton did not like the new direction the film series was <b>heading</b> <b>in,</b> and was replaced by Val Kilmer as Batman. Chris O'Donnell was introduced as Robin, Jim Carrey starred as The Riddler, while Tommy Lee Jones starred as Two-Face. Filming started in September 1994, and Schumacher encountered problems communicating with Kilmer and Jones. Batman Forever was released on June 16, 1995 with financial success, earning over $350 million worldwide and three Academy Award nominations, but the film was met with mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|Holroyd joined League One club Preston North End for an {{undisclosed}} fee on 20 January 2012.

5|$|In private, Thơ {{expressed}} his displeasure with Diệm's rule to U.S. officials.

During the McNamara Taylor mission to South Vietnam, Thơ confided his belief that the country was <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> the wrong direction to the American delegation, imploring them to pressure Diệm to reform his policies. He privately revealed his belief that of the thousands of fortified settlements built under Nhu's Strategic Hamlet Program, fewer than thirty were functional.|$|E

5|$|Carruthers joined Conference Premier club York City on 28 September 2009 on a one-month loan {{to provide}} {{competition}} for the left-side.

Carruthers scored his first York goal with the opening goal in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham on 5 December 2009 after <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> a Michael Rankine cross. After the loan spell concluded, he was offered a one-and-a-half-year contract by York and was subsequently released by Oxford. He signed for York permanently on 6 January 2010.

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They {{were separated by}} {{less than a minute}} after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{disagreement}} with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over {{the direction the}} party was <b>heading,</b> <b>in</b> 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded {{in a pile of}} burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public Holocaust denial meeting hosted by David Irving.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the MTA {{proposed}} a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport.

The MTA {{estimated that the}} rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, {{and the frequency of}} service would initially be every 15minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, as well as at least two trains <b>heading</b> <b>in</b> each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would have been about 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT Flushing Line would be 47minutes.|$|E
