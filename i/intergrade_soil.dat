40|$|Shrink-swell (Vertisols {{and their}} <b>intergrades)</b> <b>soils</b> cover an {{extensive}} area especially in Peninsular India with smectites {{as the dominant}} mineral. It was felt necessary {{to find out the}} species of smectites for better management of these soils. Hence, two benchmark Vertisols namely Seloo from Wardha and Saikhindi from Ahmadnagar districts of Maharashtra were chosen for the study. High resolution mineralogical analysis employed through X ray diffraction (XRD) techniques of the silt, total clay and fine clay fractions of both the pedons were carried out along with Greene-Kelly test with only fine clays. Silt (50 - 2 μm), total clay (< 2 μm) and fine clay (< 0. 2 μm) fractions are dominated by smectite in both the soils; the smectites content increased gradually with decreasing size fraction. The fine clay fractions are mostly composed of smectite with small amounts of vermiculite and traces of chlorite, kaolin and feldspar. Greene-Kelly test indicated that both Seloo and Saikhindi soil fine clays are dominated by beidellite/nontronite over montmorillonite. The Seloo fine clay smectite is composed of 18 – 26 per cent and 74 – 82 per cent montmorillonite and beidellite/nontronite, respectively, and for Saikhindi it is composed of 32 – 41 per cent and 59 – 68 per cent for montmorillonite and beidellite/nontronite, respectively. However, these fine clay smectites are of low charge dioctahedral nature and therefore may not have any K selectivity. This property appears to have implications in K management of shrink-swell soils of Deccan basalt area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Hydroxy-Al and-Fe interlayers were {{prepared}} in "mono-mineralic " fine and coarse clay montmorillonite and coarse clay and silt vermiculite at 3 ~ and 21 ~ The formation of hydroxy interlayers was evaluated by X-ray diffraction, cation exchange capacity, and chemical analyses. At comparable particle size {{and regardless of}} temperature, the amounts of hydroxy-Al and-Fe interlayers in montmorillonite exceeded by far those formed in vermiculite. Likewise, the aluminum systems exhibited ahigher degree of interlayering than iron systems. Within montmorillonite, the amount of hydroxy-A 1 and-Fe interlayers increased as the particle size decreased, regardless of temperature. The aluminum interlayered montmorillonite equilibrated at 3 ~ was characterized by basal spacings of about 17, ~ after Ca-saturation plus 54 per cent relative humidity. These spacings are larger than those normally observed for smectites. Within vermiculite systems equilibrated at 3 ~ more hydroxy-AI interlayers were recorded in coarse clay than in silt fraction, whereas at 2 I ~ about equal amounts of interlayers were formed. By contrast, hydroxy-Fe interlayer was favored by the silt fraction at both temperature levels. The formation of aluminum interlayers in both minerals increased with increasing temperature. The formation of hydroxy-Fe interlayers in montmorillonite was generally not temperature d pendent, whereas the formation of such interlayers in vermiculite increased slightly with increasing temperature. These data may partially explain the formation of chloritic <b>intergrades</b> in <b>soils</b> {{as a function of}} type of minerals, kind of ions, and thermal variations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{coniferous}} monoculture {{on the distribution}} of C, Fe and Al in the upper horizons of brown ochreous earths of the Belgian Ardennes were investigated by comparing 5 soil profiles developed under an 80 year old spruce stand with another 5 profiles developed under a climactic broad-leaved forest (beechwood). Organic carbon, Fe and Al were extracted with 0. 1 N NaOH/Na-tetraborate solution buffered at pH 9. 7 : recent studies have shown that this extraction is particularly appropriate for the detection of incipient podzolisation in brown earths-brown podzolic <b>soils</b> <b>intergrades.</b> Even if most of the classic podzolisation 'indexes' fail to illustrate differences, nevertheless our results show that fulvic acids and organo-ferric complexes are present in significantly greater amounts in {{the upper part of the}} cambic (B) 1 horizon of the soils developed under conifers. Moreover, this podzolic tendancy is confirmed by the weathering patterns of the clay minerals in the A 1 (B) horizons developed under spruces, i. e. a more pronouced weathering of chloritic layers than those observed in the beechwood soil, with a correlative genesis of more abundant smectite-like minerals. One may therefore conclude that the change in the humus type (moder to mor) after the planting of spruce trees, has been sufficient, within the local climatic and edaphic context, to promote incipient podzolisation. © 1981 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr. W.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the relationship between groundwater flow, soil moisture regimes, and soil genesis and distribution in a hummocky morainal landscape. In addition, the color criteria used to classify soils affected by saturation and reduction were examined on soils that were monitored for soil moisture and redox potential. The results of this study indicate that the genesis of soils in a given landscape position can be related to certain groundwater flow conditions, as based on piezometers and observation wells. Non-saline and non-carbonated soils in upland depressions can be attributed to "depression-focused" recharge by snow and snowmelt runoff in the spring, as evidenced by groundwater mounds and strong recharge conditions. The upper surface of the water table in the spring resembles a "mirror-image" of the ground surface and extensive leaching occurs under the upland sloughs. Non-saline and carbonated soils around upland depressional fringes, on lower slope positions, are found to be associated with local discharge in the spring via the adjacent groundwater mound, as well as upward flow in the summer when phreatophytic consumption by willows created a water table depression around the slough fringes. Normally, a shallow water table would be expected to dominate these soils in the spring, as evident by carbonates at the soil surface. However, the two dry years of this study resulted in a much deeper water table in the spring. Saline and carbonated soils at low elevations in the study area can be associated with a shallow and rather stable water table, and local discharge fran surrounding higher elevations. The relatively short length of the local flow systems and high salinity of the soil extracts in this area, indicates that the soluble salt content of the glacial till is a factor in increasing soil salinity at discharge ends of local flow systems. Generally, carbonated or non-carbonated, and non-saline soils on mid and upper slope positions can be related to a deep water table with mainly recharge or lateral flow occurring in the saturated zone. Highly permeable gravel and sand lenses in the till deposits channel flow laterally, and determine to a large extent flow direction, within the less permeable glacial till. Upland soil types are more dependent on slope position and infiltration than the depth to water table or groundwater flow. Electrical conductivity and soluble salt distribution of soil extracts reveal that upland depression infiltration of surface runoff water is the dominant factor in influencing distribution of soluble salts in this hummocky landscape. Low quantities of soluble salts under the upland depressions and higher values in adjacent upslope soils suggest lateral flow is not a major water redistribution process. The dominance of magnesium sulphate salts throughout the area indicates that relatively short local flow systems prevailed in this area. Soils in a given landscape position exhibit similar chemical characteristics as evident by dithionite-, oxalate- and pyrophosphate-extractable iron, electrical conductivity values, Mg++/Ca++ ratios of water-soluble soil extracts, and the presence or absence of Mg-bearing calcites in the upper Ck or Cca horizons. Humic Luvic Gleysols exhibit the greatest reduction as exemplified by matrix chromas of 1 or less. Other Gleysols are less strongly gleyed, having moderately low matrix chramas and mottles. Mottle contrast may be too specific at the present time to correctly classify soils affected by saturation and reduction. Most Cca horizons near the soil surface in Gleysolic soils have rusty mottles, indicating that these horizons were once reduced. Four soils in upland depressions and three soils on lower slopes were monitored for extent of saturation and redox potential. The two soils occupying the middle of the sloughs, which had the wettest moisture regime in the spring, exhibit reducing conditions. It is doubtful whether soil moisture and redox conditions recorded were representative of actual conditions during soil development, due to the two abnormally dry years of this study. Color criteria fail to satisfactorily identify some gleyed <b>intergrades</b> and well-drained <b>soils</b> on mid and upper slope positions...|$|R
