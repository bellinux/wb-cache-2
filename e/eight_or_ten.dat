5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten,</b> where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E

5|$|The 2/28th Battalion probed {{into the}} Pocket on 16 June. The {{previous}} day a 2/11th Commando Squadron patrol had {{reported that the}} track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled, and {{on the morning of}} the 16th A Company from the 2/28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it. After the bulldozer filled the crater, the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south-east of the ridge. One of the Australian tanks was damaged. A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2/11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back, with two Australians killed and another wounded. A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon, supported by a new troop of tanks. The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry, and killed <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> Japanese personnel, but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged. By the end of the day, A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded. Overall, 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade's attached medical units during 16 June, which stretched their capacity.|$|E

The Polish forces continued to make ferocious attacks, and Samuel Maskiewicz, a witness from one hussar company, claimed that his unit charged <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> times. The Polish hussars' attack on the infantry, hidden behind the fences, and using firearms, were not successful.|$|E

In addition to the mining industry, the town's merchants did a good trade with Sonora in Mexico as well as smaller regional mining camps. Harshaw received mail service on the Southern Pacific Railroad via Tombstone three times a week, and had its own newspaper, the Arizona Bullion, run by Charles D. Reppy and Company. The Bullion was launched on April 28, 1880, and had reached a circulation of 400 as of 1881.|$|E

25|$|Houses {{were usually}} leased for the year, {{but also for}} longer terms, rent being paid in advance, half-yearly. The {{contract}} generally specified that the house be in good repair, and the tenant was bound to keep it so. The woodwork, including doors and door frames, was removable, and the tenant might bring and take away his own. The Code stipulated that if the landlord re-entered before the term was up, he must remit a fair proportion of the rent. Land could be leased {{for the purpose of}} building houses or other buildings on it, the tenant being rent-free for <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years; after which the building came into the landlord's possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{tidal flow}} through Cook Strait {{between the two}} main islands of New Zealand is {{particularly}} interesting, as the tides {{on each side of}} the strait are almost exactly out of phase, so that one side's high water is simultaneous with the other's low water. Strong currents result, with almost zero tidal height change in the strait's center. Yet, although the tidal surge normally flows in one direction for six hours and in the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions, the reverse surge might be entirely overcome so that the flow continues in the same direction through three or more surge periods.|$|E
25|$|Cephalopods, as {{the name}} implies, have muscular {{appendages}} extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In coleoids they number <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten.</b> Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed tentacles, are actively involved in capturing prey; they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds). In giant squid they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club. The shorter four pairs are termed arms, and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism. They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help {{to hold onto the}} prey. Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, {{as the name}} suggests, though developmental abnormalities can modify the number of arms expressed.|$|E

5000|$|Siropaiones, Siropaeones, Siriopaiones or Siriopaeones (Ancient Greek: Σιροπαίονες, Σιριοπαίονες, ή Σιρινοπαίονες) were {{an ancient}} Paeonian tribe inhabiting the Strymon plain. They {{were one of}} <b>eight</b> (Herodotus) <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> (Thucydides) tribes of Paeonia. They were {{situated}} from the Bisaltae and Odomanti to the south, Sinthi to the north, the Strymon to the east, Maedi to the west, and a mountain chain separating them from Crestonia. Their capital was Siris (Serres). They were defeated by Persian general Megabazus (486 BC). They were expelled by the Persians to Asia Minor, where they are assumed to have founded Serraepolis.|$|R
25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows {{are believed to}} date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern shop windows to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High Street, number 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of Hospital Street and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses soffit tenons with diminished haunch, a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|In some manifestations, {{particularly}} as angry, ferocious aspects of Shakti such as Durga or Kali, she has <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> arms, and is astride on a tiger or lion. In benevolent manifestation such as Kamakshi or Meenakshi, a parrot sits near her right shoulder symbolizing cheerful love talk, seeds and fertility. A parrot is found with Parvati's form as Kamakshi - {{the goddess of}} love, as well as Kama - the cupid god of desire who shoots arrows to trigger infatuation. A crescent moon is sometimes included near the head of Parvati particularly the Kamakshi icons, for her being half of Shiva. In South Indian legends, her association with the parrot began when she won a bet {{with her husband and}} asked for his loin cloth as victory payment; Shiva keeps his word but first transforms her into a parrot. She flies off and takes refuge in the mountain ranges of south India, appearing as Meenakshi (also spelled Minakshi).|$|E
25|$|At one point, the Potez 637 was {{the only}} modern {{aircraft}} equipping the Groupes de Reconnaissance (GOA), which had long been equipped with obsolete aircraft. From November 1939 onwards, the first units to convert to the Potez P.63.11 were each assigned three aircraft. By mid-January 1940, there were 43 Potez 63.11s in service with 12 GOAs. By June 1940, more than 700 reconnaissance Potez 63.11 had been delivered. These aircraft encountered various fates in service: more than 220 were destroyed or abandoned. Despite the addition of extra machine gun armament, aircraft having received either six, <b>eight,</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> machine guns, the Potez 63.11 suffered the heaviest losses of any French type. One factor contributing to the high losses was the near-complete lack of spares, rendering 70 per of all P.63.11 aircraft unserviceable even prior to the German invasion; many aircraft were destroyed on the ground by enemy bombing and strafing attacks, and entire units were wiped out without conducting a single mission.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{purchase}} of the Vantage by Eviation Jets, the proposed EV-20 was envisioned as a twin-engine design with two Williams FJ44-1AP turbofan engines, with a projected cruise speed of 424 kn at 36000 ft with an approximate range of 1300 nmi km. In the executive configuration it would have provided room for <b>eight</b> passengers, <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> commuter passengers. It would incorporate Garmin G1000 avionics, and would be made entirely from composite materials. kBky 2006, initial review of the EV-20 design were completed and construction of a prototype aircraft was expected to begin, utilizing an outside fabricator for construction of the prototype.|$|R
50|$|The Russian {{player has}} three {{paratroop}} units, which may only drop during winter turns, and {{that must be}} dropped within range of the Russian STAVKA headquarters unit. Paratroops are weak (combat factor of one, as opposed to three to <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> even <b>ten</b> for other units), but {{may be useful in}} cutting off German retreat. The Russian player also has three partisan counters, which may be deployed to cut railway lines, but that may not be deployed near an SS unit. The game also contains rudimentary rules for seaborne movement and invasions in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea.|$|R

25|$|Leavitt {{arrived in}} the Canadian Arctic {{in the late nineteenth}} century as the New England and San Francisco-based whaling fleet pursued their targets into the frozen {{northern}} seas. The oil-bearing bones in the heads of bowhead whales were highly sought-after and brought large profits to the whalers. Captains of the whaling ships (first sail, and later steam-powered) would leave San Francisco in early summer, then whale in the Beaufort Sea for as long as the season would allow (generally <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> weeks) before new ice set in in September. Then they would go into winter quarters at Herschel Island, Alaska. By early the next summer, as soon as the ice broke, the whaling vessels would depart the Herschel with their catch from the previous year, which they would transport to San Francisco via the Bering Strait. In San Francisco, the vessels would sell their catch, refit their vessels, then depart again for the north, where they would repeat the exercise all over again.|$|E
25|$|Fort San Carlos was a {{military}} structure built in 1816 to defend the Spanish colonial town of Fernandina, Florida, now called Old Town, which occupied a peninsula on {{the northern end of}} Amelia Island. The fort, a lunette fortification, stood on the southwest side of the town next to the harbor, on a bluff overlooking the Amelia River. It was made of wood and earthworks, backed with a wooden palisade on the east side, and armed with an <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> gun battery. Two blockhouses protected access by land on the south, while the village was surrounded with military pickets. An 1821 map of Fernandina shows that the street plan, laid out in 1811 in a grid pattern by the newly appointed Surveyor General of Spanish East Florida, George J. F. Clarke, today preserves nearly the same layout as that of 1821. The fort occupied the area bounded by the streets Calle de Estrada, Calle de White, and Calle de Someruelus. The structure itself has disappeared and only traces remain in what is now Fernandina Plaza Historic State Park.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the {{contract}} signed with Vickers in November 1910, one member of the Kongō classthe lead ship Kongōwas to be built in Britain and Vickers were to maximize technology transfer to Japan.

500|$|Financial {{constraints}} {{meant that}} {{there would have to}} be a trade-off between speed, battle capabilities, and displacement. The initial design specifications mandated that speed was to have been at least as high as with the Moltke class, and that the ship was to have been armed with either <b>eight</b> [...] guns <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> [...] guns. The design staff considered triple turrets, but these were discarded when it was decided that the standard 280mm twin turret was sufficient.|$|R
5000|$|The kamale ngoni or [...] "young man's harp" [...] {{was invented}} by the {{musician}} Alata Brulaye in the 1960s.
