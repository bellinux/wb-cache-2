60|$|Alvina {{rose and}} went round {{to the little}} balcony. Two men stood below, amid the {{crumbling}} of finely falling snow. One, the elder, had a bagpipe whose bag was patched with shirting: the younger was dressed in greenish clothes, he had his face lifted, and was yelling the verses of the unintelligible Christmas ballad: short, rapid verses, followed by a brilliant flourish on a short wooden pipe he held ready in his hand. Alvina felt he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> breath. But no, rapid and high came the next verse, verse after verse, with the wild scream on the little new pipe in between, {{over the roar of}} the bagpipe. And the crumbs of snow were like a speckled veil, faintly drifting the atmosphere and powdering the littered threshold where they stood--a threshold littered with faggots, leaves, straw, fowls and geese and ass droppings, and rag thrown out from the house, and pieces of paper.|$|E
