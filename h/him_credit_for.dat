5|$|Entering the 1946 St. Louis Browns season, manager Luke Sewell was {{reluctant}} to turn Zoldak into a starter, but eventually gave him the nod. His first two starts were both victories, {{one of which was}} a complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox, which gave <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> three of the Browns' first eight wins of the season. He pitched in 35 games over the season, 21 of them starts, and ended the year with a 3.43 ERA, a 911 record, and a career-high 51 strikeouts. Unlike the previous season, Zoldak was slow to start in 1947, not winning his first game until June 22 against the Washington Senators. He finished the season similar statistically to 1946: he played in 35 games and started 19, and had a record of 9-10 and a 3.47 ERA. During the offseason, Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck offered $100,000 for Zoldak, but were turned down, and he remained on the Browns to begin the 1948 season. Zoldak was projected to be the team's opening day starting pitcher against the Cleveland Indians, who had planned for him; instead he was used in relief and Fred Sanford was named the starter the day of the game.|$|E

On 1 February 1919, a commission from the military intelligence branch that evaluated Italian aerial victories disapproved his first three and last two claims, but granted <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> 17 aerial victories during the war. His appointment as a sottotenente came through on 23 March 1919.|$|E

25|$|With {{victory at}} the Battle of Adwa and the Italian colonial army destroyed, Eritrea was Emperor Menelik’s for the taking but no order to occupy was given. It seems that Emperor Menelik II was wiser than the Europeans had given <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for.</b> Realizing that the Italians would bring all their force to bear on his country if he attacked, he instead sought to restore the peace that had been broken by the Italians and their treaty {{manipulation}} seven years before. In signing the treaty, Menelik II again proved his adeptness at politics as he promised each nation something for what they gave and made sure each would benefit his country and not another nation. Subsequently, The Treaty of Addis Ababa was reached between the two nations. Italy was forced to recognize the absolute independence of Ethiopia. (See Article III of the Treaty of Addis Ababa).|$|E
25|$|On {{his second}} patrol (2–28 November 1942), Brandi {{was ordered to}} the Mediterranean Sea where he was placed {{under the command of}} the 29th U-boat Flotilla. His mission in the Mediterranean theater of {{operations}} was to help secure the supply routes for the Afrikakorps in North Africa. To get to his destination Brandi had to traverse the heavily guarded Strait of Gibraltar. Brandi made the passage on 8 November 1942 submerged. Nevertheless, U-617 was discovered by a British Short Sunderland bomber which dropped two depth charges, but missed. That day, British-American forces invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch (8–16 November 1942). At 11:27 on 21 November, Brandi attacked a strong British naval task force, firing a spread of four torpedoes at distance. Following the assault, U-617 came under attack. Over four hours, 80 depth charges were dropped on U-617. At 16:00 on 23 November, Brandi unsuccessfully attacked a cruiser before arriving in La Spezia on 28 November 1942. Although no ships were actually sunk that day, the Führer der Unterseeboote Italy (FdU—Leader of U-boat Operations) later credited Brandi with the sinking of one cruiser of French or American origin, and one destroyer. Additionally the FdU acknowledged that Brandi had torpedoed two freighters, their sinking was assumed. The FdU denied <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> having severely damaged a battleship.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{continued}} {{to shape the}} negative view of Harding with several nonfiction works in the 1930s, culminating with The Incredible Era—The Life and Times of Warren G. Harding (1939) in which he called his subject [...] "an amiable, well-meaning third-rate Mr. Babbitt, with the equipment of a small-town semi-educated journalist... It could not work. It did not work." [...] Dean deems the works of White and Adams [...] "remarkably unbalanced and unfair accounts, exaggerating the negative, assigning responsibility to Harding for all wrongs, and denying <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> anything done right. Today there is considerable evidence refuting their portrayals of Harding. Yet the myth has persisted." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Mexican-American War, as colonel of the 2nd U.S. Infantry, Riley fought at the Siege of Veracruz and the Battle of Cerro Gordo, {{where he}} was cited for bravery. He was brevetted brigadier general and assumed command of the 2nd Brigade in David E. Twiggs's Second Division. [...] He led his brigade at the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco, where Winfield Scott gave <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. victory: Riley had {{discovered}} a way around the rear of Velencia's position. He was appointed brevet major general and fought at the Chapultepec. After the battle at Churubusco, he also presided over the courts-martial of 72 deserters of the so-called Saint Patrick's Battalion discovered hiding in the San Patricios convent; among them [...] were John Murphy and John Riley. He was generally {{considered one of the}} ablest brigade commanders in the army during the war with Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. [...] On breaking apart the plaster {{it was found that}} veins of copper were formed running right through it. [...] So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments sometimes get <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E
500|$|From 1847 to 1861, the Knickerbockers {{selected}} Adams {{as their}} president six times, and as a vice president, treasurer, or director in six other years. As president of the club, Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine-man teams and nine-inning games. When the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) was formed in 1858, he led {{the rules and regulations}} committee of the new organization. In his role, Adams ruled that the fields' bases should be [...] apart, the modern distance, and supported the elimination of the [...] "bound rule", which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs. He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862. Adams' contributions in creating baseball's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death, but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in The New York Times; by 1993, researcher John Thorn had written about Adams' role. Other historians have given <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> helping to develop the sport, and Thorn has called Adams [...] "first among the Fathers of Baseball".|$|E

500|$|History {{views the}} results of the [...] "Tuskegee Airmen Experiment" [...] as a {{tremendous}} success, in which Parrish played a significant role, and proved that blacks could perform well in both leadership and combat roles. Parrish felt people should be judged by their capability, not their color. During its development Parrish would often return from Washington DC depressed because of the massive resistance to the Tuskegee program. Decades later at Tuskegee Airmen reunions, when Parrish's name was called everyone applauded with a standing ovation. The experience of the AAF during World War II necessitated that the military review its policies on the utilization of black servicemembers. Confrontation, discussion, and coordination with both black and white groups led AAF leaders to the conclusion that active commitment, leadership, and equal opportunity produced a more cost-effective, viable military force. In 1948, President Harry Truman signed an Executive Order on equality of treatment and opportunity in the military, due in no small part to the successes of the Tuskegee Airmen. Parrish was commander of Tuskegee Field from 1942 to 1946 and historians generally give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> improving morale, living conditions, relations between blacks and whites, and relations with local citizens.|$|E
500|$|Thierry Henry {{paid tribute}} to Larsson's {{contribution}} to Barcelona's win after the game, saying, [...] "People always talk about Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; {{you need to talk}} about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You have to remember that Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} Test, Leyland scored 126 after the team lost {{the first three}} wickets for 20 runs; many critics judged this to be his {{greatest}} innings. At this point, he had scored four centuries in seven Test innings against Australia. He played an effective defensive innings in the second innings, and another in the second Test, when he was criticised for slow scoring. Then in the third Test, on a pitch made exceptionally difficult for batsmen by rain, England could only score 76 for nine; Leyland scored 17 of those runs and according to Wisden, [...] "was the one real success for England... never seemed in difficulties". In the second innings, he scored a century In total, in five Test matches, he scored 441 runs {{at an average of}} 55.12. Australian critics viewed Leyland as one of England's best batsmen, and gave <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> England's strong showing early in the series. In all first-class games on the tour, he scored 902 runs at 50.11; he was unsuccessful in three games the team played in New Zealand on completion of the main tour.|$|E
500|$|Tierney in 2006 {{assembled}} {{a group of}} investors to form Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC, a group started with the purpose of buying The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Mr. Tierney also became the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Initially, there were concerns about Tierney's neutrality because of earlier roles he held working in Republican politics and clashes he had with some reporters. But Mr. Tierney calmed those fears by hiring respected journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner William K. Marimow as editor of The Inquirer and by signing a pledge not to interfere with the editorial content of the two newspapers. Under Mr. Marimow, the editorial quality of The Inquirer improved as the paper returned to its roots by doing more investigative stories. Initially, circulation increased in 2007 and advertising sales improved. Meanwhile, the Daily News won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for a series of stories on corrupt Philadelphia cops. However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a steep drop in advertising revenue. At the same time, circulation dropped as more readers migrated to the Internet. Newspaper values across the country plummeted by 90 percent or more. Mr. Tierney's group bought the paper {{at the top of the}} market and was saddled with a heavy debt burden. As a result, Philadelphia Media Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 28, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com were sold at a bankruptcy auction to a group of the original lenders, hedge funds and vulture investors led by Angelo Gordon & Company for $139 million. Mr. Tierney stepped down from his position as CEO of the company on May 21, 2010 in order to allow for a smooth transition. Several news accounts of his tenure have called him an [...] "improbable savior" [...] and an [...] "unlikely warrior." [...] Other accounts have said, [...] "For Tierney...his tenure as CEO by many measures could be rated a success." [...] and [...] "As for Tierney, give <b>him</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> trying." ...|$|E
