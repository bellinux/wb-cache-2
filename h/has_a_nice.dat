Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic gave a positive opinion on Usher's development, writing [...] "He looks good, his material is smooth and seductive, and he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> voice, even if he tends to favor melisma". Erlewine also labelled the album as [...] "a classy, seductive affair" [...] but was ambivalent towards its material, {{due to the lack}} of memorable tracks.

500|$|The New York Times writer Stephen Holden {{considered}} Bedtime Stories as [...] "easily Madonna's best album", {{and concluded}} {{that it was a}} [...] "seductive mixture of soft-focus hip-hop and bittersweet ballads". Peter Galvin from The Advocate magazine gave a positive review, describing the album as [...] "a gorgeously produced R album with lots of funky beats lush keyboards, and soaring Love Unlimited-style string arrangements". Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna's most low-key album and her best work at the date. J.D. Considine, while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun, declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener-friendly than Madonna's previous albums. He added that it [...] "seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer's first album, emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements", while praising Madonna's vocal performance. Linda L. Labin from the Bangor Daily News, noted that [...] " [...] isn't taking any chances. This time around, her daring {{has more to do with}} music than lyrics", while also praising her vocals; [...] "If anything, her singing is the album's greatest strength.

'Madonna sings well' â€” bet you don't see that headline in the tabloids anytime soon". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two-stars-and-a-half out of four, writing that the album [...] "seems the least remarkable of all Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. [...] It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> consistently relaxed feel, its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time".|$|E

500|$|Aware of {{what does}} {{and does not}} work in {{television}} animation, Schooley and McCorkle knew that Kim needed to be a physically attractive character. Kim's appearance evolved dramatically {{over the course of}} three months. The character was originally designed to look like [...] "a pretty standard-looking athletic blonde", which was gradually changed in favor of a more distinctive appearance. At one point, Kim's design was based on that of video game character Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. However, the Disney Channel eventually determined that Lara [...] "is ... not a very real character." [...] Finally, the creators decided to give Kim a more realistic appearance akin to that of a 14-year-old girl as opposed to a bombshell, concluding, [...] "She <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> very appealing design, but we just wanted to keep it out of that realm of video game heroine." [...] The creators admitted that Kim would have been their [...] "dream girl" [...] in high school, joking, [...] "She would have been way out of our class though." [...] Director Chris Baily wanted Kim to be designed with [...] "graphic sensibilities" [...] {{similar to those of the}} show's backgrounds, creating a 3D character [...] "whose feet can be planted on the ground and communicate a sense of space." [...] For example, when the character is dressed in all-black, Kim was drawn without a white outline so that she virtually disappears when she moves in front of a black background, yet her [...] "simple design" [...] and flesh allows audiences to [...] "fill in where her body is" [...] naturally. The show's female characters are the only characters drawn with lips, only the upper of which is visible. Describing Kim as [...] "a mostly graphic heroine", Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times author Giannalberto Bendazzi agreed that the character's [...] "limited animation" [...] was intentional. In the fourth season, the character's signature crop top and cargo pants are replaced by a T-shirt and pants because the former outfit was damaged during a fight with Shego. Some viewers noted that Kim's face appeared to be [...] "rounder" [...] than it had been drawn in previous seasons. Kim was animated by Rough Draft Korea.|$|E

Andy Gill of The Independent gave the album two out of five stars and criticized Fiasco's lyrics, stating [...] "while his flow <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> bounce and monotonal glide, too many tracks end with one wondering what exactly he's said, if anything at all". David Amidon of PopMatters panned the album as [...] "a disgustingly awkward effort from everyone involved [...] Listenability? Credibility? These, Lasers is lacking in seismic qualities". Brandon Soderberg of Spin found it to be affected by crossover tendencies and wrote that [...] "Lasers works best, however, when the grabby hooks, electro beats, and conscious rap rants are all turned down a notch". Los Angeles Times writer Todd Martens shared a similar sentiment and commented that the album [...] "feels more like a compromise than a cohesive album".
