40|$|Seventeen {{patients}} with acute, persistent postvagotomy atony after vagotomy with antrectomy or pyrloroplasty for peptic ulcer underwent a doubleblind {{study of the}} relief of postvagotomy atony by metoclopramide. All patients had complete, functional gastric obstruction {{for at least three}} weeks postoperatively, precluding oral alimentation. Contrast studies and gastroscopy ruled out mechanical obstruction in each patient. Gastric outlet obstruction was confirmed by radioisotope assessment of gastric emptying of a special solid meal labeled with Technetium 99 m DTPA. A gamma camera over the epigastrium precisely quantitated the emptying rate of the labeled meals. After baseline scanning an intravenous placebo was given to each patient and all 17 showed gastric retention of the meal after 90 minutes. Gastric emptying rates were restudied 24 hours later after intravenous metoclopramide and all 17 patients then immediately emptied the labeled meals. These patients then received standard postgastrectomy diets. Eight patients received metoclopramide tablets (10 mg 30 minutes a. c., q. i. d.) and nine received placebo tablets. Each of the eight patients receiving metoclopramide ate normally immediately after treatment with no further evidence of <b>gastric</b> <b>atony.</b> The nine patients receiving the placebo were unable to retain any oral feedings and were then given oral metoclopramide which promptly relieved <b>gastric</b> <b>atony.</b> All 17 patients received metoclopramide for one month without side effects after which the drug was discontinued with no recurrence of gastric symptoms during follow-up periods ranging from three to 27 months. Metoclopramide safely and effectively relieves acute, nonmechanical <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> when this occurs after surgical treatment of peptic ulcer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Although radiologic {{confirmation}} of tube placement remains the "gold standard, " {{there is growing}} evidence that pH testing of feeding-tube aspirates can reduce (although not totally eliminate) reliance on x-rays used for this purpose. This article describes that evidence and tells how it was obtained. Reducing the number of x-rays needed to confirm tube position can have far-reaching financial benefits. It is often necessary to differentiate between gas-tric and intestinal feeding-tube placement in pa-tients {{at high risk for}} pulmonary aspiration. For example, although some patients may safely receive feedings in the stomach, others (especially those with <b>gastric</b> <b>atony)</b> may need feedings in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum to minimize gas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pyeongwisan (PW) is an herbal {{medication}} used {{in traditional}} East Asian medicine to treat anorexia, abdominal distension, borborygmus and diarrhea caused by <b>gastric</b> catarrh, <b>atony</b> and dilatation. However, {{its effects on}} inflammation-related diseases are unknown. In this study, we investigated the biological effects of PW on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -mediated inflammation in macrophages and on local inflammation in vivo. We investigated the biological effects of PW on the production of inflammatory mediators, pro-inflammatory cytokines and related products {{as well as the}} activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Additionally, we evaluated the analgesic effect on the acetic acid-induced writhing response and the inhibitory activity on xylene-induced ear edema in mice. PW showed anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β). In addition, PW strongly suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a NO synthesis enzyme, induced heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) expression and inhibited NF-κB activation and MAPK phosphorylation.

40|$|A {{heart valve}} {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most technically difficult cardiac surgeries. For the patient, it means a mental and physical health intervention. Heart valve surgery is currently the second most common cardiac surgery - accounting for up to 20 % of the total number of cardiac surgeries. The goals and objectives of a heart valve replacement are to improve patients' quality of life and their medical prognosis. The heart valve replacement is carried out only in cases when we cannot perform the heart valve plastic surgery and thereby replace the entire heart valve with an artificial one. Heart valve prosthetics can be mechanical - patients with this kind of prosthetics are then warfarinized for life or they can also be made of biological material (bioprosthetics). Patients with bioprostehtics require only a three month long anticoagulant therapy. Temporary postoperative complications may occur such as dyspnoea, <b>gastric</b> and intestinal <b>atony</b> or aggravation of pulmonary functions. Among the rarer complications are rhythm disorders, thrombosis of prosthetic heart valve, and last but not least infective endocarditis. The patients, after the heart valve replacement, are at a greater risk of complications, therefore they are obliged to always have their patient at risk of infection endocarditis card with them (see appendix 4). After the operation the patients are informed about the lifestyle changes they are to follow within their daily routine, the information is delivered by doctors and nurses. The task of the nurses is to inform the patient about the lifestyle changes together with doctors. Good understanding and observance of these lifestyle changes help to improve patients' life after the heart valve replacement. This bachelor thesis is divided into an empirical and theoretical part. The theoretical part focussing on the problems connected with the heart valve replacement, valvular imperfections, perioperative nursing, patients' lifestyle changes and their quality of life...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{evaluate}} reoperation for recurrent gastroesophageal reflux (GER) after {{a failed}} Nissen fundoplication. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Nissen fundoplication is an accepted treatment for GER refractory to medical therapy. Wrap failure and recurrence of GER are noted in 8 % to 12 %. METHODS: Medical records of 130 children undergoing a second antireflux operation for recurrent GER from January 1985 to June 1996 retrospectively were reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred one patients (78 %) were neurologically impaired (NI), 74 (57 %) had chronic pulmonary disease, and 8 had esophageal atresia. Recurrent symptoms included vomiting (78 %), growth failure (62 %), choking-coughing-gagging (38 %), and pneumonia (25 %). Gastroesophageal reflux {{was confirmed by}} barium swallow, gastric scintigraphy, and endoscopy. Operative findings showed wrap breakdown (42 %), wrap-hiatal hernia (30 %), or both (21 %). A second Nissen fundoplication was performed in 128 children. Complications included bowel obstruction (18), wound infection (10), pneumonia (6) and tight wrap (9). There were two postoperative (< 30 days) deaths (1. 5 %). Of 124 patients observed long term, 89 (72 %) remain symptom free. Eight were converted to tube feedings. Twenty-seven required a third fundoplication, and 19 (70 %) were successful outcome. Two with repetitive wrap failure due to <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> underwent gastric resection and esophagojejunostomy. CONCLUSION: Nissen fundoplication was successful in 91 % of patients. In 9 % with wrap failure, a second Nissen fundoplication was successful in 72 %. Reoperation is justified in properly selectedpatients. Conversion to jejunostomy feedings is suggested for neurologically impaired after two wrap failures and a partial wrap in those with esophageal atresia and severe esophageal dysmotility. Repeated wrap failure due to <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> requires gastric resection and esophagojejunostomy...|$|E
40|$|An 8 -year-old male {{castrated}} Maine Coon with {{a history}} of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was presented to Cornell’s Internal Medicine Service for a two month history of lethargy, inappetence, weight loss, and pharyngeal gurgling, and a three day history of regurgitation. The cat was suspected to be suffering from esophagitis/gastric reflux, secondary to chronic enteric disease (e. g flare up of IBD, or GI lymphoma). Thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound revealed megaesophagus, gastroduodenal dysmotility, small intestinal thickening, and a proximal small intestinal intussusception. Surgical resection of the intussusception greatly reduced the cat’s clinical signs {{for a short period of}} time, but subsequent abdominal ultrasound showed persistent gastric and proximal duodenal ileus that appeared refractory to prokinetic therapy. Systemic complications of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) stasis ultimately led to the cat’s euthanasia. A cause for his megaesophagus, <b>gastric</b> <b>atony,</b> and intussusception was not found, although an autonomic nervous system disorder was suspected...|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{ulceration}} {{was recognized}} as an occasional complication of vagotomy soon after Dragstedt championed the operation {{for the treatment of}} duodenal ulceration (Dragstedt and Owens, 1943). <b>Gastric</b> <b>atony</b> and antral stasis were to be expected after vagotomy without adequate drainage of the gastric contents and it was perhaps not surprising that a number of patients should have developed lesser curve gastric ulceration after vagotomy alone. The mechanism responsible for the development of gastric ulceration in these circumstances was later considered to be due to gastric retention, antral stasis and alkalinization, and gastrin release, with the resulting continual gastric acid stimulation (Drag-stedt, 1953; Burge, 1964; Oberhelman, 1964). The occurrence of gastric ulceration after vagotomy lent further support to Dragstedt's well known postulate that all gastric ulceration was dependent on the hormonal phase of gastric secretion consequent upon antral stasis and 'hyperfunction or dysfunction of the gastric antrum ' (Dragstedt, 1953, 1956). Other workers have not noted a significant difference in gastric emptying between duodenal and gastric ulce...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} to characterize any changes {{occurring in the}} human gastric control electrical rhythm (CER), following a variety of gastric surgical procedures. Pairs of electrodes were implanted in selected specific sites on the stomachs of 57 patients undergoing either antrectomy and vagotomy, proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV), vagotomy and drainage, gastric resection without vagotomy, or fundoplication. Five patients undergoing nongastric operations served as controls. After operation recordings were obtained with differential preamplifiers, an oscilloscope, and a dual-channel tape recorder. An electrical signal compatible with a CER was found almost always in the distal body or antrum, regardless of whether vagotomy was performed. In contrast, a CER was found only occasionally in the fundus, and was never found following PGV. Although {{there was a difference}} in the frequency of occurrence of fundic CER in patients with and without vagotomy, it was not statistically significant (p = 0. 0668). Patients with prolonged postoperative convalescence because of <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> were compared with patients with normal postoperative courses regarding {{the presence or absence of}} CER in the gastric antrum or fundus. A statistically significant relationship between abnormal gastric motility and absence of CER was not established...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese herbal {{medicine}} (Kampo) Ninjinto {{has been used}} for the treatment of gastroenteritis, esogastritis, <b>gastric</b> <b>atony,</b> gastrectasis, vomiting, and anorexia. The pharmacological effects of Ninjinto on the gastrointestine are due to changes in the levels of gut-regulated peptide, such as motilin, somatostatin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The release of these peptides is controlled by acetylcholine (ACh) from the preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic nerve. Thus, we examined the effects of the selective M 1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on the elevation of Ninjinto-induced plasma the area under the plasma gut-regulated peptide concentration-time curve from 0 to 240 [*]min () in humans. Oral pretreatment with pirenzepine significantly reduced the Ninjinto-induced elevation of plasma motilin and substance P release (). Combined treatment with Ninjinto and pirenzepine significantly increased the release of plasma somatostatin () compared with administration of Ninjinto alone or placebo. Ninjinto appeared to induce the release of substance P and motilin into plasma mainly through the activation of M 1 muscarinic receptors, and pirenzepine may affect the pharmacologic action of Ninjinto by the elevation of plasma substance P, motilin, and somatostatin...|$|E
40|$|Postsurgical gastroparesis {{syndrome}} (PGS) is {{a complex}} disorder characterized by postprandial nausea, vomiting, and <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> without evidence of mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. These symptoms can be disabling and are frequently unresponsive to drug therapy. Fifteen patients with documented PGS, including 13 women and two men, were recently treated by completion gastrectomy (CG) over a 5 -year period. Gastric emptying study (GES) was markedly prolonged in 12 of the patients studied, and improved partially in only one patient (8 %) with the administration of metoclopramide alone or combined with other gastrokinetic drugs. Patients were evaluated {{both before and after}} surgery, using a modified Visick rating system and a severity of symptoms (SS) score based on seven gastrointestinal (G. I.) and five systemic variables. All 15 patients underwent CG and reconstruction with a 50 cm Roux-en-Y limb. There were no operative deaths or complications related to the esophagojejunal anastomosis. Mean postoperative follow-up was 13. 9 months, with a range of 2 - 65 months. After CG, the Visick rating and overall SS score improved significantly. The improvement in SS score was primarily due to a significant decrease in G. I. symptoms with little or no change in systemic symptoms. Overall, 86 % of patients reported a satisfactory clinical result. CG, while seemingly radical, can be performed with low risk, and for properly selected patients with PGS, may be the treatment of choice...|$|E
40|$|Abnormalities in the {{function}} of the stomach in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus, usually insulin-dependent, may provide difficult management problems. There is a reduced frequency of peptic ulcer disease in diabetics. Gastric atrophy, often with parietal cell antibodies, is common and the frequency of pernicious anemia with its expected intrinsic factor antibodies is increased. Gastric analysis results have been conflicting but generally suggest that long-standing diabetics have lower acid levels than normals, possibly secondary to vagal neuropathy. <b>Gastric</b> <b>atony</b> occurring in a small but significant number of patients with longstanding insulin-dependent diabetes, usually with a clinically apparent peripheral neuropathy, has been associated with upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and a clinical picture of gastric outlet obstruction. Various degrees of subclinical delays in gastric emptying are probably present in many asymptomatic patients and, indeed, are underemphasized contributors to poor control of blood sugar levels. Studies utilizing radioactive-labeled physiological meals have demonstrated abnormalities in the gastric emptying of solids, in particular, and sometimes liquids in the latter stages of the disease. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, which stimulates upper gastrointestinal smooth musculature, results in accelerated gastric emptying; clinical trials have shown that it is capable of alleviating symptoms related to diabetic gastroparesis and with its recent approval and release in this country, it promises improved management of this entity. Another agent, domperidone, a selective peripheral dopamine antagonist with no appreciable side effects, is in this country an investigational drug which has shown clinical efficacy in Europe in improving gastric stasis syndromes...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{share our}} {{experience}} of the management and outcomes of patients with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI). METHODS: The charts of seven patients who underwent surgery for PCI between 2001 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical features, diagnoses and surgical interventions of patients with PCI are discussed. RESULTS: Seven patients with PCI (3 males, 4 females; mean age, 50 1; 16. 1 years; range, 29 - 74 years) were analyzed. In three of the patients, abdominal pain was the only complaint, whereas additional vomiting and/or constipation occurred in four. Leukocytosis was detected in four patients, whereas it was within normal limits in three. Subdiaphragmatic free air was observed radiologically in four patients but not in three. Six of the patients underwent an applied laparotomy, whereas one underwent an applied explorative laparoscopy. PCI localized to the small intestine only was detected in four patients, whereas it was localized to the small intestine and the colon in three. Three patients underwent a partial small intestine resection and four did not after PCI was diagnosed. Five patients were diagnosed with secondary PCI and two with primary PCI when the surgical findings and medical history were assessed together. <b>Gastric</b> <b>atony</b> developed in one case only, as a complication during a postoperative follow-up of 5 - 14 d.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that erythromycin, a motilin agonist, reduces the incidence of early DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is {{a leading cause of}} morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy, occurring in up to 40 % of patients. The pathogenesis of DGE has been speculated to involve factors such as peritonitis from anastomotic leaks, ischemia to the antropyloric muscles, and <b>gastric</b> <b>atony</b> in response to resection of the duodenal pacemaker or reduction in circulating motilin levels. METHODS: Between November 1990 and January 1993, 118 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy completed this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The patients received either 200 mg of intravenous erythromycin lactobionate every 6 hours (n = 58), or an identical volume of 0. 9 % saline (n = 60) from the third to tenth postoperative days. On the tenth postoperative day, a dual phase radionuclide gastric emptying study was performed. RESULTS: The erythromycin and control groups were comparable regarding multiple preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors. The erythromycin group had a 37 % reduction in the incidence of DGE (19 % vs. 30 %), a significantly reduced (p < 0. 05) need to reinsert a nasogastric tube for DGE (6 vs. 15 patients), and a significantly reduced (p < 0. 01) per cent retention of liquids at 30 minutes and solids at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. No major adverse reactions to erythromycin were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Erythromycin is a safe, inexpensive drug that significantly accelerates gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy and reduces the incidence of DGE by 37 %. These data support the use of erythromycin to decrease early DGE after pancreaticoduodenectomy...|$|E
