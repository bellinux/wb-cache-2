5|$|In 2002, Emanuel {{ran for a}} seat in the U.S. House of Representatives {{vacated by}} Rod Blagojevich, who {{resigned}} to become governor of Illinois.

5|$|Season 3 {{begins with}} Underwood's {{presidency}} {{off to a}} rocky start: six months into his term, he is unpopular with the public, and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward.

5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressional</b> leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|With {{incumbent}} U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt {{choosing to}} retire, Keating declared his candidacy in the 2010 congressional election. In order {{to run for}} Delahunt's 10th district seat, Keating moved from his longtime home in Sharon (located in the neighboring 4th district) to a rental property in Quincy. On September 14, he won the Democratic primary against state senator Robert O'Leary. Keating faced Republican state Representative Jeff Perry in the general election. In {{the wake of the}} Tea Party movement and the election of Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown, the campaign was unusually close for a modern Massachusetts race, which would normally skew heavily Democratic. The Keating campaign largely focused on a 1991 incident during Perry's tenure as a police sergeant, in which a teenage girl had been illegally strip-searched by another officer while Perry was on the scene. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Congressional</b> Campaign Committee ran a widely aired advertisement highlighting the incident and challenging Perry's character. With 47 percent of the vote, Keating defeated Perry (42 percent) and two independents in the November 2 election.|$|E
