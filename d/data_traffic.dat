5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of <b>data</b> <b>traffic</b> which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

25|$|Network {{capacity}} – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters, {{the former}} head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics, a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of <b>data</b> <b>traffic</b> collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen's Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} locationof the Internet user, the user's {{counterparties}} {{in a commercial}} transaction, the headquarters facilities of any involved commercial entities, and even the servers and switchesis important for tax purposes. For example, of the nine U.S. states that currently tax access in some manner, four make reference to location. [...] In each case, both the provision of service and the billing must take place within the state. Connecticut places the burden of determining whether this is so upon the Internet service provider. But in general, there is no simple way to determine location, owing largely to the Internet's lack of boundaries. Users can and routinely do access their accounts from remote locations; providers are almost always located in multiple taxing jurisdictions; and the <b>data</b> <b>traffic</b> itself, via the Internet's packet-switched architecture, is routed through myriad locations. [...] Such issues are important not only for practical reasons of determining the incidence of the tax and its enforcement, {{but also because the}} U.S. Constitution requires that a state or taxing sub-jurisdiction have [...] "nexus" [...] with the transaction in order to exert its taxing power, and that determination rests precisely upon such considerations.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet. In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies. Packet capture is the monitoring of <b>data</b> <b>traffic</b> on a computer network. Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called [...] "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete [...] "message" [...] again. Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, {{in order to examine}} their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers [...] "messages" [...] but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic.|$|E
