But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} BioShock {{received some}} criticism from PlayStation 3 owners, {{who found the}} port from the native Windows and Xbox 360 developed by a separate studio, Digital Extremes, to be lackluster. To address this, Irrational Games has stated that the PlayStation 3 version of Infinite {{would not be a}} port, as that version is being developed in-house simultaneously with the Windows and Xbox 360 versions. In addition, the PlayStation 3 version of the game will support stereoscopic 3D. BioShock Infinite will support the PlayStation Move motion controller. Though some reports believed that a new Move controller would be produced for the game based on information from Sony, 2K Games debunked these stories, stating that no new hardware is being developed for the game. The North American PlayStation 3 version of the game will include a copy of the original BioShock. Levine has expressed interest in a Wii U version of Infinite in light of what abilities the touchscreen controller can offer, but contends that the decision to develop for that platform is [...] "really a discussion that the business people have and see if <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> Nintendo, if <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> Take Two".

2500|$|More recent {{criticism}} {{has often been}} academic and limited to particular features. University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wonders whether <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> the Connecticut Compromise to give [...] "Wyoming {{the same number of}} votes as California, which has roughly seventy times the population". Levinson thinks this imbalance causes a [...] "steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states." [...] Levinson is critical of the Electoral College as it allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority, or even plurality, of votes. Five times in American history, presidents have been elected despite failing to win a plurality of the popular vote: 1824 (John Quincy Adams), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison), 2000 (George W. Bush) and 2016 (Donald Trump). The current impeachment powers do not give the people a quick way to remove incompetent or ill presidents, in his view. Others have criticized gerrymandering.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{has also}} been {{interpreted}} in more metaphorical ways. Some modern scholars are inclined {{to believe that the}} poem celebrates the Treaty of Brundisium, from which sprung forth the Second Triumvirate between Octavian and Marc Antony. Floyd, on the other hand, proposed that the puer mentioned throughout the poem is not an actual child, but rather Virgilian poetry itself. He noted that the word puer is elsewhere used by Virgil in the Eclogues to refer to shepherds, individuals who are closely associated with the art of poetry. Furthermore, he points out that the verb incipere, which is used three times in Eclogue 4, is itself associated with [...] "poetic performances" [...] in other Virgilian poems, like in Eclogue 3.58. Finally, Floyd—who subscribes to the theory that cui non risere parentes is what Virgil wrote—proposed that line 62 refers to a boy whose parents will smile, only [...] "after due consideration", meaning that the child must earn its parents' smiles. Floyd goes on to argue that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>for</b> the parents to either be Virgil or the Muses, individuals whose smiles must be earned; the Muses are critical of those whom they inspire, whereas Virgil—as a meticulous artist—was critical of himself.|$|E

We also design an algorithm for semidefinite programming with box constraints, achieving a competitive ratio of O(log F*), where F* is a sparsity measure of the semidefinite program.
