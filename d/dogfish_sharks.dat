5|$|Cladistic {{studies have}} {{consistently}} {{found that the}} closest relatives of the kitefin shark are the cookiecutter sharks (Isistius), with which they share several dentitional, skeletal, and muscular similarities. Dalatias and Isistius {{are believed to have}} evolutionarily diverged shortly after the transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (65.5 Ma), {{as part of a larger}} adaptive radiation of <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks</b> from the deep sea into relatively shallower habitats.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks.</b> This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks.</b> The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened. The reproductive characteristics of the black dogfish, such as a large female maturation size, may render it susceptible to overfishing, though it is more fecund than other deep-sea <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks.</b> In the northeastern Atlantic, catches of this species are managed {{as part of the}} total allowable catch for deep-sea sharks set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks</b> that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableA nuclear {{decapping}} and binding protein, X 29 /Nudt 16, {{was originally}} characterized in Xenopus, {{and has also}} been characterized in humans. It is suggested that not only the protein's sequence, but also its functions has been preserved through evolution. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize a homologue of Nudt 16 in the <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark,</b> which on an evolutionary scale is quite diverged from frogs and mammals. Here the open reading frame encoding the <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein was amplified via PCR and cloned into an expression vector. When placed into bacteria under the proper growth conditions, a Histidine-tagged <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein is synthesized. The protein can be purified from bacteria. The purified <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> protein will be tested to determine if it has the same biochemical properties as the mammalian and frog proteins: can the protein decap RNA in vitro and can it bind RNA directly. Does this protein have catalytic activity that is essential for a healthy life?NSF grant to B. Peculus, NSF-REU Program in Biological Sciences & Biochemistr...|$|R

500|$|The {{copper shark}} feeds more towards {{the bottom of}} the water column than the top, {{consuming}} cephalopods, including squid (Loligo spp.), cuttlefishes, and octopus; bony fishes, including gurnards, flatfishes, hakes, catfishes, jacks, Australian salmon, mullets, sea breams, smelts, tunas, sardines, and anchovies; and cartilaginous fishes, including <b>dogfish</b> <b>sharks</b> (Squalus spp.), stingrays, skates, electric rays, and sawfishes. Cephalopods and cartilaginous fishes become relatively more important food for sharks over [...] long. Young sharks also consume scyphozoan jellyfish and crustaceans, including mud shrimps (Callianassa) and penaeid prawns. It does not attack marine mammals, though has been known rarely to scavenge on dolphins that had succumbed to fishing nets.

40|$|The blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -barrier (CSFB) {{is formed}} by the Choroid Plexūs (CP). Together with the blood brain barrier it {{represents}} an important barrier between brain and circulating blood. Since {{it can only be}} passed by small, lipid-soluble and uncharged molecules it is of particular interest to study active transport processes for charged substances across this tissue, especially because many drugs are substrates for these transport proteins. Transporters in the CP are similar to those in the kidney. Therefore, I performed comparative experiments with model organic anions in isolated proximal kidney tubules of killfish and CP of rat and spiny <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark.</b> ·First, I studied transport of the fluorescent cAMP analog fluo-cAMP. Inhibition studies indicate transport mediated by the export proteins Mrp 2 and Mrp 4. In contrast to transport of the Mrp 2 -substrate fluorescein-methotrexate (FL-MTX), transport is not regulated by proteinkinase (PK) A, and PKC. For better characterization of kinetic parameters I studied transport of fluo-cAMP in membrane vesicles of MRP 2 and MRP 4 overexpressing cells. Both MRPs transported fluo-cAMP with similar affinites. Different from results obtained from experiments using renal proximale tubules, fluo-cAMP transport in CP seems not to be mediated by Mrp 4, whereas a participation of Mrp 1 is likely. Regulation of fluo-cAMP transport in rat CP is not mediated by PKA, PKC or mitogen activated PK (MAPK). ·Transport of Texas Red (TR) and FL-MTX was studied in CP of rat and spiny <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark.</b> Transport of TR across rat CP is a two-step mechanism, which is metabolism-driven, Na+-dependent, potential independent and also independent from Mrp 1, Mrp 2 and Mrp 4. In <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> CP TR transport is Na+-independent, with apical uptake apparently mediated by an Oat-protein, whereas basolateral efflux seems to be mediated by Oatp 2 and Mrp 1. ·Apical uptake of FL-MTX in rat CP is also Na+-independent with an potential independent basolateral efflux, which is presumably mediated via Mrp 1 and Oatp 2. Activation of PKA results in an activation of FL-MTX efflux. In <b>dogfish</b> <b>shark</b> FL-MTX is transported via the same transport proteins. But in contrast to rat CP, activation of PKA results in a reduced efflux of FL-MTX, whereas activation of PKC leads to a downregulation of FL-MTX transport...|$|R
