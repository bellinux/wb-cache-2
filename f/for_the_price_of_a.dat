The organizers felt the troops provided informal entertainment and were an attraction to the exposition.|$|E
25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} [...] "guinea" [...] in [...] "guinea pig" [...] {{is harder to}} explain.

[...] "Guinea" [...] was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal. Another hypothesis suggests the [...] "guinea" [...] in the name is a corruption of [...] "Guiana", an area in South America. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guinea coin; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term [...] "Ginny-pig" [...] as early as 1653.
