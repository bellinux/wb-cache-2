40|$|Mapping {{forest cover}} {{types in the}} boreal {{ecosystem}} is important for understanding the processes governing {{the interaction of the}} surface tcith the atmosphere. In this paper, <b>ice</b> <b>report</b> the results of the land-cover classification of the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data acquired during the Boreal Ecosystem Atmospheric Study's intensive field campaigns over the southern study area near Prince Albert, Canada. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori classifier was applied on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne SAR images covering the region during the peak of the grouping season in July 1994. The approach is supervised in the sense that a combination of field data and existing land-cover maps are used to develop training areas for the desired classes. The images acquired were first radiometrically and absolutely calibrated, the incidence angle effect in airborne images was corrected to an acceptable accuracy, and the images were used in a mosaic form and geocoded and georeferenced with an existing landcover map for validation purposes. The results show that SAR images can be classified into dominant forest types such as jack pine, black spruce, trembling aspen, clearing, open water, and three categories of mixed strands with better than 90 % accuracy. The unispecies stands such as jack pine and black spruce are separated with 98 % accuracy, but the accuracy of mixed coniferous and deciduous stands suffers from confusing factors such as varying species composition, surface moisture, and understory effects. To satisfy the requirements of process models, the number of cover types was reduced from eight to five general classes of conifer wet, conifer dry, mixed deciduous, disturbed, and open water. Reduction of classes improved the overall accuracy of the classification over the entire region from 77 % to 92 %. Â© Elsevier Science Inc., 1997...|$|E

40|$|Sea ice extent {{can serve}} as proxy {{environmental}} data for long-term variability of the climate system, as input to test climate change models or to compare to historical fish landing data. The Newfoundland-Grand Banks sea ice record has been previously assembled over a two-hundred-year period by the second author. We have now compiled an historical record of the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the Scotian Shelf of Atlantic Canada. Data have been compiled {{on an annual basis}} from the early 1800 s to 1962; ice data for these areas from 1963 to the present are available and archived by the Canadian Ice Service. The current study was undertaken to extend the sea ice database back in time as far as possible, and to provide a means of testing statistical relationships being identified from analysis of the more recent forty-year data set. A variety of data sources were used in the compilation of ice records including ice patrol and shipping reports, local newspapers, lighthouse records and other holdings in the U. S. and Canadian National Archives. In the order of 20, 000 ice records, amounting to over 500 pages of re-typed print, were found spanning the years 1752 to 1962; even Canada's first newspaper has an <b>ice</b> <b>report</b> on Monday, March 23, 1752 in The Halifax Gazette! Information for early years is sporadic, but is continuous from about 1820. In addition, annual Canadian government Gulf of St. Lawrence ice survey reports were identified covering the period from the mid- 1950 s so the emphasis in the search was for ice records prior to that time. All the available resources are described, as is the method that was used in condensing the large number of reports into meaningful monthly ice charts for a season which could extend from December until June. For these, the areal coverage of sea ice was calculated and the ice boundary lines digitized. The resultant time series of ice extent can be used to identify trends and anomalies, and to compare to other time series of North Atlantic ice extent such as the Grand Banks and Baltic ice extents, the Iceland sea ice record, and to climatic factors such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. Natural gas development is well underway on Sable Island Bank of the Scotian Shelf, and while no ice has visited Sable Island or the gas development areas in recent memory, {{it is clear from the}} Scotian Shelf ice record that intrusions into the current ice production areas are not unusual historically. In 1882 a major sea ice incursion southward from Grand Banks allowed sea ice, icebergs, and apparently much colder bottom sea water to intrude much further south than usual. Sea ice was seen off New England, and a massive fish kill of benthie dwelling tile fish and robin fish that suffered sub-lethal temperatures was the result. Estimates at the time, by ships passing in and out of the Boston-Gloucester area of Massachusetts, placed 60, 000, 000 dead and dying fish on the sea surface.

The thin ice spectrum occurs when the ice is greater than 4 cm thick and appears to result from the accumulation of brine at the ice surface. Thin ice has a relatively stable spectrum characterized by high brightness temperatures, a near-zero spectral gradient at vertical polarization, and a large difference between vertical and horizontal polarizations. It is concluded that thin ice can be detected using satellite data...|$|R
40|$|Experiments and {{computer}} simulations of the transformations of amorphous ices display different behavior depending on sample preparation methods, {{and on the}} rates of change of temperature and pressure to which samples are subjected.

50|$|Ice {{navigation}} occurs wherever a waterborne vessel transits through sea ice. One of {{the more}} common regions for ice navigation is the Baltic Sea, where vessels visiting the Baltic States will make their way through first year ice in the winter months, often with an Icebreaker, or with <b>ice</b> <b>reports,</b> charts and data provided by meterological offices.

The problems of increased shipping in polar regions presents additional challenges, including maritime safety concerns in the event that ice navigation is not carried out carefully. Ships will also pass through ice when navigating in the Antarctic, although most ships are either research vessels or cruise ships that have been especially ice strengthened. Other significant maritime regions where ships will navigate through Ice include the Saint Lawrence Seaway, around Greenland and the Canadian coast, the North Atlantic during iceberg season and through the Northwest Passage.|$|R
