5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag.

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity.

5|$|Between 1995 and 2004 {{there were}} 2,630 {{accidents}} involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of 317 lives.

After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.|$|E

5|$|CryoSat-2 {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for CryoSat-1, whose Rokot carrier rocket was unable to achieve orbit, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the satellite. Compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2 features software upgrades, greater battery capacity and an updated instrument package. Its main instrument is an interferometric radar range-finder with twin antennas, which measures the height difference between the upper surface of floating ice and surrounding water. This is often known as 'free-board'.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the low-elevation {{region of}} the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, {{the disappearance of the}} lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of hydraulic pressure, {{which in turn}} caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E

5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} NATO, and the accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS fights with its political allies (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of much public support. AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of {{all or part of}} his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{regression}} also resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of epeiric seas, {{such as the}} Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss {{of these}} seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.|$|E
