5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed feeling about the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a <b>horror</b> <b>movie</b> by others.|$|E
5|$|Other {{stories for}} the {{character}} include blackmail, one-night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant by the serial's villain Cain Dingle. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the fear of losing her new-found family increases. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Jane Simon from the Daily Mail said her first scenes resembled a <b>horror</b> <b>movie,</b> while her colleague Jaci Stephen has opined that Amy wears too much make-up. However, entertainment website Digital Spy has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three Best Newcomer awards for her portrayal of Amy. Halfpenny announced her departure from Emmerdale in October 2013. She departed on 14 November 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Sinsen Line {{was among}} those {{proposed}} for closure in 2002 when the tram company attempted to save money by transferring the traffic to buses. A city grant of 25 million Norwegian krone (NOK) saved the line along with several others. The metro station was {{for many years in}} bad need of rehabilitation, with dim lighting at the platforms, grimy walls, and broken roof tiles leaving piping and wiring exposed. Architect Reiulf Ramstad, {{who was in charge of}} the renewal project, compared the station to the scenery of a <b>horror</b> <b>movie.</b> The 2006 renovation involved making the station brighter lit, and a new entrance was built which attempted to make the station more visible from outside. Upgrading of the station included letting parts of sculpture exhibitions by the Norwegian Sculpturer Society be placed inside the station area. From 20 August 2006, Carl Berners plass also started serving the Ring Line of the metro. The line branches off from the Grorud Line north of Carl Berners plass, and the station thereby became the transfer station between the Ring Line and the Grorud Line. From 2008, the square itself was rebuilt to become more pedestrian-friendly.|$|E

5|$|When backup {{arrives on}} the scene, an injured Wetzel {{claims that he}} {{encountered}} gang members. The police soon discover and surround Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), believing them to be criminals, before they realize that the pair are FBI agents. Mulder and Scully claim that they are investigating an alleged werewolf that killed {{a man in the}} area during the last full moon. According to Mulder, the entity that they are tracking only comes out at night. Scully is irritated by the constant presence of the Cops crew, but Mulder is enthused at the prospect of paranormal proof being presented to a national television audience. The agents and the police interview Mrs. Guerrero, who describes the monster to Ricky (Solomon Eversol), a sketch artist. To Mulder's surprise, Mrs. Guerrero describes not a werewolf, but the <b>horror</b> <b>movie</b> villain Freddy Krueger. Ricky expresses a fear of being alone in the dangerous neighborhood, and is found a short time later with serious slashes in his chest. Mulder and Scully find a pink fingernail at the scene. The group also meets Steve and Edy (J. W. Smith and Curtis C.), a couple who witnessed the incident but did not see Ricky's attacker, saying that it appeared he was being attacked by nothing. Scully shows the couple the fingernail, which they identify as belonging to Chantara Gomez (Maria Celedonio), a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Filmmaker George A. Romero {{was brought}} in with {{a vision of a}} zombie-style <b>horror</b> <b>movie</b> similar to Night of the Living Dead, but which also relied heavily upon {{elements}} of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens {{as a result of his}} preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.|$|E
