25|$|The Greek playwright Aristophanes {{noted the}} {{abortifacient}} property of pennyroyal in 421 BC, through a humorous reference in his comedy, Peace. Hippocrates, the Greek physician, would advise prostitutes who became pregnant to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> touching her buttocks with her heels at each leap, {{so as to}} induce miscarriage. Other writings attributed to him describe instruments fashioned to dilate the cervix and curette inside of the uterus.|$|E
500|$|Strawberry Field was {{the name}} of a Salvation Army children's home just around the corner from Lennon's {{childhood}} home in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool. Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton, Nigel Walley and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home. One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park, near the home, where a Salvation Army band played. Lennon's aunt Mimi Smith recalled: [...] "As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> shouting, 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Pandemonium burst loose {{among the}} Salisbury adherents. The men bawled, the women screamed, the boys shrieked, and all waved their hats <b>and</b> flags, <b>and</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> {{manifested}} symptoms of baseball insanity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he hasn't gone away! It's just as I said, he hasn't gone away!" [...] cried Happy Jack, {{and he was}} so {{relieved}} that he <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> as a result nearly tumbled out of the tree.|$|R
500|$|According to Gruff Rhys [...] "Do or Die" [...] has a [...] "ridiculously {{positive}} outlook" [...] and {{was written}} {{in an attempt to}} [...] "kickstart [...] back into gear" [...] after a bad period in the singer's life. The track is a [...] "driving song" [...] and features sampled car noises so that [...] "even if you're not in a car it feels like you are". Although Rhys has called the track a [...] "dumb pop song" [...] with [...] "really daft" [...] lyrics, he has also claimed that the title was inspired by the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to [...] "Do or Die" [...] and use non-violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India. Rhys has stated that he feels the fact that [...] "five-year-olds" [...] can <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> to the song, singing [...] "Gandhi lyrics", is important, as it contrasts with the [...] "self-important ... pompous" [...] lyrics of singers such as Jim Morrison and Robert Plant. The track was recorded in the middle of 1998 at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, {{along with the rest of}} Guerrilla, and was produced by Super Furry Animals.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, {{numerous}} {{references are}} made to the jukebox musical Mamma Mia!, in which Jack tells Liz about his possible three fathers, Jack agreeing {{to meet with the}} three men, and Liz saying [...] "And all I'm promising is a madcap musical romp, dot dot dot, fun, dot dot dot, good.... That was on the [...] poster", and finally Jack revealing his kinship to Milton. Liz tells Jack that he should find out who his real father is, explaining [...] "If I have learned anything from my Sims family: When a child doesn't see his father enough he starts to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> then his mood level will drop until he pees himself." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Liz and Pete learn from James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) that Tracy's favorite television show is NCIS, a CBS police drama series revolving around special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), who conduct criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. Later, Liz and Pete sing the song [...] "It Takes Two" [...] by hip-hop duo Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock to see if Tracy is familiar with the song as they have doubts about the age Tracy claims to be.|$|E
2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which {{is connected to the}} core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
60|$|I {{can well}} {{remember}} {{the explosion of}} human joy which marked the sudden starting of that train; all the factory girls who could not find seats (and {{they must have been}} the majority) relieving their feelings by <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> Now I have never seen any rationalistic idealists do this. I have never seen twenty modern philosophers crowd into one third-class carriage for the mere pleasure of being together. I have never seen twenty Mr. McCabes all in one carriage <b>and</b> all <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was named}} after the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be {{observed}} particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The song's lyrics were written by Rhys about [...] "the weather", and were inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern the singer saw on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. Rhys {{has said that he}} views [...] "The Turning Tide" [...] as more serious than the other tracks on Guerrilla. The song's lyrics are about living in a time of change and embracing change. Although [...] "Do or Die" [...] has [...] "really daft lyrics" [...] its title [...] was taken from the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to [...] "Do or Die" [...] and use non-violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India. Rhys has stated that he feels quite pleased that young children can <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> to the song, singing [...] "Gandhi lyrics". [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] is a comic, but also quite sinister, song about the possible effects of mobile phone radiation on people's health. Both [...] "Night Vision" [...] and [...] "Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy" [...] have lyrics inspired by the band's nights out in Cardiff. The former addresses bouncers who caused problems for the group by throwing them out of nightclubs, and the aggression that the band frequently witnessed on Saturday nights in the city. The latter is a very happy song about [...] "being in love and going out to the Hippo Club in Cardiff and feeling bulletproof and unstoppable".|$|E

6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with him?" [...] Sylvie asked, walking with a little extra sedateness, by way of example to Bruno at the other side, who never ceased <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|There was an {{incident}} in 2005 when Sheffield Wednesday supporters <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on the previous temporary stand full {{and some of its}} middle section gave way; however, nobody was injured.|$|R
6000|$|The lady made an {{exceedingly}} gentle inclination of her black-velvet bonnet, and said, [...] "Pray, my love, {{remember that it}} is just dinner-time. However, never mind ME." [...] And with another slight toss and a nod to the postilion, that individual's white leather breeches began to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> again in the saddle, and the carriage disappeared, leaving me shaking my old friend Berry by the hand.|$|E
60|$|But this astonishment of {{mine was}} much increased, when some days after, a storm came upon us, and the captain rushed out of the cabin in his nightcap, and nothing else but his shirt on; and leaping up on the poop, began to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and curse and swear, and call the men aloft all manner of hard names, just like a common loafer in the street.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!' chuckled Rikki-tikki. 'The boy is safe, {{and it was}} I--I--I {{that caught}} Nag by the hood {{last night in the}} bath-room.' Then he began to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> all four feet together, his head close to the floor. 'He threw me to and fro, but he could not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two. I did it. Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with me. You shall not be a widow long.' ...|$|E

30|$|We analyze {{solutions}} using fast-slow analysis. The {{basic idea}} is that the solutionevolves on two different time scales: During the <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> thesolution evolves on a fast time scale, while during the silent and activephases, the solution evolves on a slow time scale. The fast-slow analysis allows usto derive reduced equations that determine the evolution of the solution during eachof these phases. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for the times when eachcell <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> use these to determine the outcomes of the races tothreshold, depending on parameters and initial conditions. To derive these formulas,we will make some simplifying assumptions on the equations; in situations in whichsuch formulas cannot be obtained, then a similar analysis can be donenumerically.|$|R
50|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the Scum DualDisc in March 2007, a music video produced by Earache Records was released for the song. The video shows a crying girl <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Twichell {{tells how}} at Kandersteg {{they were out}} {{together}} one evening [...] where a brook comes plunging down from Gasternthal and how he pushed [...] in a drift to see it go racing along the current. [...] "When I got back [...] to the path Mark was running down stream after it {{as hard as he}} [...] could go, throwing up his hands and shouting in the wildest ecstasy, [...] and when a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam [...] below he would <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and yell. He said afterward that he [...] had not been so excited in three months." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the first}} day of her arrival, Dot was all eagerness and joy. Miss Bombien fully obeyed her {{instructions}} to let the child run. Dot entered the house only to eat her meals, which she did with growing appetite, and then away she would romp to chase butterflies, visit the stables or poultry yard, or sit near the river bank and watch the driftwood float by. Sometimes a boat danced over the broad, blue waters, and then Dot would <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and clap her hands in ecstasy at the pretty sight. The river soon became her favorite resort, for the green banks and terraces before the house ran down to the water's edge.|$|E
60|$|It is {{astonishing}} how quickly knowledge {{of any such}} advisable precaution spreads among even such arrogantly stupid people as first-class passengers ordinarily are. By the time a certain train had started for Dover with that friend of the Easy Chair's already mentioned, every soul in his first-class compartment had telegraphed ahead, and when they arrived in Calais the earliest Englishman who got past the customs ran ahead and filled the racks of the carriage with his hand-baggage, so that the latest Frenchman was obliged to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and scream, and perhaps swear in his strange tongue, before he could find room for his valise, and then calm down and show himself the sweetest and civilest of men, and especially the obedient humble servant of the Englishman who had now made a merit of making way for his bag.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi, {{stop the}} 'bus! stop the 'bus!" [...] cried Moses, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> gesticulating in great excitement. [...] "My principal's got {{something}} to say! My principal wants to do a bit of talkin'." ...|$|R
60|$|But Betty, {{ignoring}} these, <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{before the}} dingy clock, demanding further trumpetings, and, turning to Mrs. Oakley, as one possessing influence, {{she was aware}} of a curious, intent look in the old lady's eyes.|$|R
60|$|At last {{he could}} see the spire of the little church on the hill, and when the steamer rounded the point, affording a full view of the town, and sounded her whistle as a signal for those on the shore to come to the pier, Toby could hardly {{restrain}} himself from <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> shouting in his delight.|$|R
60|$|Mowgli, who {{had been}} trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like or {{understand}} this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold Lairs late in the afternoon, and {{instead of going to}} sleep, as Mowgli would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told his companions that Mowgli's capture marked a new thing {{in the history of the}} Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began to pull their friends' tails or <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on all fours, coughing.|$|E
60|$|By the way, how awkward it is, though, {{having to}} depend on public-houses and churches for the time. The former are {{generally}} too fast and the latter too slow. Besides which, your efforts {{to get a glimpse}} of the public house clock from the outside are attended with great difficulties. If you gently push the swing-door ajar and peer in you draw upon yourself the contemptuous looks of the barmaid, who at once puts you down in the same category with area sneaks and cadgers. You also create a certain amount of agitation among the married portion of the customers. You don't see the clock because it is behind the door; and in trying to withdraw quietly you jam your head. The only other method is to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> outside the window. After this latter proceeding, however, if you do not bring out a banjo and commence to sing, the youthful inhabitants of the neighborhood, who have gathered round in expectation, become disappointed.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{concentric}} rings {{were formed}} around the preacher, the inner one composed of women, the outer one of men, {{the faces of}} those forming the inner ring being turned towards those in the outer. As soon as all were in place, each brother reached forth his hand, and took {{the hand of the}} sister opposite to him, and then each couple began to <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> violently, shaking hands and singing {{at the top of their}} voices. After about a minute of this, the two circles moved, one, one way and one another, so that each brother found himself opposite a different sister. Hands were again immediately seized, and the jumping, hand-shaking, and singing went on. Minute by minute the excitement increased; faster the worshippers jumped, and louder they sang. Through it all Brother Enoch Hines kept on with his sermon. It was very difficult now to make himself heard, and the time for explanation or elucidation had long since passed; all he could do was to shout forth certain important and moving facts, and this he did over and over again, holding his hand at the side of his mouth, as if he were hailing a vessel in the wind. Much of what he said was lost in the din of the jumpers, but ever and anon could be heard ringing through the church the announcement: [...] "De wheel ob time is a turnin' roun'!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, PLEASE {{mind what}} you're doing!' cried Alice, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as {{an unusually large}} {{saucepan}} flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.|$|R
5000|$|A {{parody of}} [...] "Kookaburra" [...] has {{remained}} popular in Australian schoolyards for over 3 decades: [...] "Kookaburra sits on an electric wire, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with his pants on fire. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra. Hot your pants must be." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{collaboration}} with W P Kindree, Pitts constructed a 2,700 lb prototype with a [...] Curtiss OX-5 engine. A newsreel of 1928 shows the Sky Car attempting to fly; however {{rather than take}} off, it merely <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
