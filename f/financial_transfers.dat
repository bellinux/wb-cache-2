5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, {{to the tune of}} a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested for treason in the Agartala Conspiracy Case, and was released during the 1969 uprising in East Pakistan which resulted in Ayub Khan's resignation.

His participation in the Carnival was not limited to his samba school. For decades he invested money in the organization of parades. Dissatisfied with where the official league, the Associação das Escolas de Samba da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro (AESCRJ), was heading for and feeling a need to negotiate more openly with the government about <b>financial</b> <b>transfers</b> to the Carnival, Castor helped found the Liga Independente das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro (LIESA - Samba Schools' Independente League of Rio de Janeiro) in Rio de Janeiro in 1984. He served as LIESA's first president. Because of the new league, the samba schools started receiving more financial assistance and the standard of the parades could be maintained.

The study is based on two different theoretical models studying slightly different views on intergenerational transfer behaviour. By using cross-sectional data from the 2 nd wave of the SHARE database (2006 / 2007) binary and linear regression models are performed with the amount or binary outcome of <b>financial</b> or time <b>transfer</b> used as a dependent variable. The empirical results show that for both <b>financial</b> and time <b>transfers</b> the explanatory variables linked to the monetary status of the donor (and the recipient in the <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> model) are significant determinants of both the probability {{and the amount of}} money or time transferred. Furthermore, the results indicate that slightly different explanations for both <b>financial</b> and time <b>transfers</b> are significant depending on whether you look at the propensity to transfer or at the amount transferred...|$|R

However, protected by British soldiers, {{the members of the}} Provisional State Government went about their responsible business devising a comprehensive concept to cover the new political, sociological, and economic situation in the land, which would serve the British military authorities. Rapid financial assistance and the restitution of property to the victims of the Nazi regime was necessary. This posed a problem because one of the very first actions of the British had been to confiscate all the property of the Nazi Party, to freeze all bank accounts, and to block all <b>financial</b> <b>transfers.</b> It took months before basic communication and public transport, mail service and supply were working again, to some extent at least. During the years that followed these turbulent days, {{a major part of the}} British Eighth Army, which in July 1945 was re-constituted as British Troops in Austria (BTA), had their headquarters in Klagenfurt, since Carinthia together with neighbouring Styria formed the British occupation zone in liberated Austria, a state of affairs which lasted until 26 October 1955.|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{decentralization}} can {{be considered}} as intergovernmental financial assistance within a state. This assistance is commonly called intergovernmental <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> that is transfer of fund from a level of government to another level. Generally, the transfer is usually occurred from a higher level of government the lower counterpart of a single state. The re- search is conducted to prove that Flypaper Effect has occurred in fiscal decentralization policy. The research finds that regional governments use the transfer for increasing their expenditures without raising the tax. The impact which is occurred from correlation of <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> by central government toward the income and expenditure of regional governments shows flypaper effect indication in the implementation of fiscal decentralization. In that case, the effect to the increase in regional expenditure is bigger than the effect toward its income. This is showing that transfer of the fund has caused the increase in vertical fiscal imbalance. Transfer of funds encourages the increase in the expenditure of autonomous regions...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} the main stakes of clean technology transfer between the North and the South {{in a context}} of economic globalization and climate change. We present a model of environmental taxation between two asymmetric countries, the North and the South. It shows that (i) there exists a technological gap between the North and the South which results from an imperfect absorptive capability of the South; (ii) this absorptive capability defines the rate of innovation in clean technologies for the South; (iii) this technological gap contributes to explain why the South pollutes more than the North in a non-cooperative game in which the environmental tax rates determine the location of the firms; (iv) cooperation is possible only if a <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> between the North and the South can be set. This <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> {{is a measure of the}} cost of this so-called Win-Win strategy according to which more outward-oriented policies would improve the environmental quality and increase the revenues of developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the structural changes {{occurring in the}} Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology industries {{the basis for a}} case study to explore the existence of a relationship between financialisation and innovation. The paper specifically examines the extent to which structural change can be identified as an outcome of ‘financialisation’, and/or a test of the effectiveness of financialisation, especially in the UK and US. It focuses on the problem of <b>financial</b> resources <b>transfer</b> within the new industry structure, from large developers and marketers of drugs to small independent innovators. The industry’s structural change permits a exploration of two related hypotheses. First, that the old vertically integrated structure was due (at least in part) to financial market imperfections, which made it more efficient to <b>transfer</b> <b>financial</b> resources within one company structure than between companies via financial transactions. Second, that the industry’s vertical disintegration results (at least in part) from improvements in the efficiency of financial mediation, making market-based <b>financial</b> <b>transfer</b> more efficient than intra-firm transfer. However, in contrast to the theoretical expectations we find our case study of the biopharmaceutical industry highlights that the impact of financialisation has been to focus the <b>transfer</b> of <b>financial</b> resources towards opportunities with short-term near market opportunities, instead of focusing on long-term innovation projects...|$|R
