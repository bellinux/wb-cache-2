Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{important}} relationships between software review meeting process and outcomes. One hundred and twenty-one industry practitioners participated in this research. The overall results show that software review meeting process has an effect on outcomes. In particular, the results indicate that (I) status effects have an effect on number of <b>defects</b> <b>found,</b> satisfaction and efficiency; (2) discussion quality has an effect on number of <b>defects</b> <b>found,</b> satisfaction and efficiency; (3) teamwork has an effect on number of <b>defects</b> <b>found,</b> satisfaction and efficiency; and (4) communication has an effect on number of <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> and satisfaction, but no effect on efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Software {{inspection}} is {{a technical}} evaluation process for finding and removing defects in requirements, design, code, and tests. Detailed {{data was collected}} {{during the first three}} years of experience at JPL on 203 inspections. Statistics are discussed for this set of inspections. Included, on a per inspection basis, are averages of: staff time expended, pages covered, major <b>defects</b> <b>found,</b> minor <b>defects</b> <b>found,</b> and inspection team size. Analysis of variance showed a significantly higher density of defects during requirements inspections. It was also observed, that the <b>defect</b> densities <b>found</b> decreased exponentially as the work products approached the coding phase. Increasing the pace of the inspection meeting decreased the density of <b>defects</b> <b>found.</b> This relationship was observed to hold for both major and minor defect densities, although it was more pronounced for minor defects. Guidelines are provided for conducting successful software inspections based upon three years of JPL experience...|$|R

On October 31, 2007, a $19 million project to rebuild the bridge was completed, and the by-pass was fully re-opened to traffic.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} {{uncertainty}} whether a <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.

50|$|No Trouble Found (NTF) is a {{term used}} in various fields, {{especially}} in the electronics industry referring to a system or component that has been returned to the manufacturer or distributor for warranty replacement or service repair, but operates properly when tested.

40|$|Abstract. Bug finding tools {{can find}} defects in {{software}} source code using an automated static analysis. This automation {{may be able}} to reduce the time spent for other testing and review activities. For this {{we need to have a}} clear understanding of how the <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by bug finding tools relate to the <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by other techniques. This paper describes a case study using several projects mainly from an industrial environment that were used to analyse the interrelationships. The main finding is that the bug finding tools predominantly find different defects than testing but a subset of <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by reviews. However, the types that can be detected are analysed more thoroughly. Therefore, a combination is most advisable if the high number of false positives of the tools can be tolerated. ...|$|R
50|$|A major {{foundation}} for modern {{awareness of the}} <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> in automobiles was laid when Ralph Nader published his book Unsafe at Any Speed about the Chevrolet Corvair and <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> in other vehicles. A focus of this book was the car manufacturers' intentional choice of saving a few dollars for each car instead of providing safe design and manufacture of their products, as well as avoiding the adding of devices which would protect car occupants from injury.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Kurt Amplatz (born February 25, 1924) is an Austrian {{radiologist}} {{and medical}} device inventor. He {{is best known}} for the invention of the Amplatzer Septal Occluder as well as the Amplatzer Cribriform Occluder, which is used for closing atrial septal defect, a common congenital heart <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> in infants. These devices are inserted by percutaneous catheter placement, thus avoiding open heart surgery. In 1958, he performed one of the first percutaneous catheterizations of the heart.|$|E
50|$|As {{can be seen}} in the {{high-level}} document {{for this}} project is specified that in all software code produced variables should be declared ‘strong typed’. On the basis of this requirement the low-level document is checked for defects. Unfortunately a defect is found on line 1, as a variable is not declared ‘strong typed’. The <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> is then reported in the list of defects found and categorized according to the categorizations specified in the high-level document.|$|E

5000|$|To {{measure the}} {{percentage}} of <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by testing (a type of test Coverage KPI vs. the escaped defects KPI) the organization should utilize the following process: ...|$|R
50|$|The process {{above is}} {{extremely}} important in case the organization is looking to start implementing RBT and to continually improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process.Measuring the test coverage is done by dividing the amount of <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by the testing provider {{with the amount of}} <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> by the users of the system. Since critical defects carry a different importance to the organization versus less severe defects, each defect is multiplied by its severity. For example, assuming a scale of 1-5 is used, a critical defect (severity = 5) will be counted {{in the same way as}} 5 minor defects (severity = 1).|$|R
5000|$|The Savvy is also {{notable for}} being the first Proton car to undergo a {{publicly}} announced recall. On April 1, 2008, Proton Edar ordered the recall of all 34,000 Savvys on Malaysian roads (of which their production dates were before December 17, 2007) for an inspection and replacement of the rear wheel bearing, based on a parts <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> during random checks.. The announcement was a precautionary measure over possibilities potential water entry into the Savvy's rear wheel bearing set might cause malfunction of its components.|$|E

5000|$|Mapping hazards {{is hardly}} an exact science. Although the symbols on the Big Apple maps were not {{designed}} to give notice of every unique <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> on the sidewalks and roads of New York City, each symbol on the map legend represents a general category of potentially hazardous defects (e.g., [...] "Hole or hazardous depression," [...] "Raised or uneven portion of sidewalk," [...] "Pothole or other hazard"). Clearly, if no symbol or a completely different symbol is used on the map, the City does not receive notice of a given defect. It follows that where the defect could reasonably be encompassed by the symbol used on the map, {{the question of whether}} the City received notice of that defect is for the fact finder and not one that can be easily answered as a matter of law.|$|E

50|$|The {{tests are}} {{intended}} to be run only once, unless a defect is discovered. Ad hoc testing is the least formal test method. As such, it has been criticized {{because it is not}} structured and hence <b>defects</b> <b>found</b> using this method may be harder to reproduce (since there are no written test cases). However, the strength of ad hoc testing is that important <b>defects</b> can be <b>found</b> quickly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} the poor {{tracking}} of the ILS localizer during the first approach attempt {{can be explained by}} the <b>defect</b> <b>found</b> on the Captain's ILS equipment. The flag current which was set too high is not of significance here, as the aircraft never flew in an area where this localizer flag would normally have to respond. There should have been a localizer indication the whole hand. On the other hand, it was extremely disturbing that the deflection sensitivity of the localizer had been set more than 50% too high. Because the localizer indication and therefore the IFS steering pointer too were so [...] "jittery", they could hardly be followed anymore. In addition, it was easy to miss crossing the localizer, as this only lasted 3-4 seconds after the second procedure turn, which was completely unsuccessful, instead of the usual 10 seconds. The difficulties in intercepting and following the localizer up to the first overshoot, which is the latest time that a change of pilot and therefore also a change of the primarily used blind flying instruments may be assumed, become evident if one compares the flight path of the first section with that of the second.|$|E
