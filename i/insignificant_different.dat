Amplitude distortions are {{shown to be}} <b>insignificant</b> for <b>different</b> scales of acoustic heterogeneities. For wavelength-scale, or smaller, heterogeneities, amplitude distortion of the wavefront is minor {{as a result of}} diffraction when the detectors are placed in the far field of the heterogeneities. For larger-scale heterogeneities at the parenchyma wall, by using a ray approach (geometric optics), we show that no refraction-induced multipath interference occurs and, consequently, that no severe amplitude distortion, such as is found in ultrasound tomography, exists. Next, we consider the effects of phase distortions (errors in time-of-flight) in our numerical studies. The numerical results on the spreads of point sources and boundaries caused by the phase distortions are in good agreement with the proposed formula. After that, we demonstrate that the blurring of images can be compensated for by using the distribution of acoustic velocity in the tissues in the reconstructions. The effects of the errors in the acoustical velocities on this compensation also are investigated. An approach to implement the compensation using only TAT data is proposed. Lastly, the differences in the effects of acoustic heterogeneity and the generation of speckles in breast TAT and breast ultrasound imaging are discussed...|$|R

For this purpose, bifunctional thiol-based ligands were employed, namely mercaptoacetic acid (MAA), 3 -mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) as well as 2 -(dimethylamino) ethanthiol (DMAET). Systematic investigations by means of photoluminescence quantum yield measurements as well as photoluminescence decay measurements {{have shown that the}} luminescence properties of the transferred nanostructures are affected by hole traps (induced by the thiol ligands themselves) as well as by spatial insulation and passivation against the environment. The influence of the tips of the nanorods on the luminescence is, however, <b>insignificant.</b> Accordingly, <b>different</b> ligands yield optimum results for different nanoparticle samples, mainly depending on the inorganic passivation of the respective samples. In case of CdSe@CdS nanorods, the highest emission intensities have been obtained by using short-chain ligands for the transfer preserving more than 50 % of the pristine quantum yield of the hydrophobic nanorods. As opposed to this, the best possible quantum efficiency for the CdSe@CdS/ZnS nanorods has been achieved via MUA.

During the experiments, both symmetric and positive asymmetric breakthrough curves of the chloride anion were measured. As expected, manifest asymmetry was obtained especially for soil columns labeled as sabA and arg. In such columns, it was also noted that the degree of asymmetry increased as the flow density increased at the sample surface. The experiments conducted on soil column labeled as sabB resulted in more symmetric BTCs. The experimental data were firstly analysed using the classical two-parameter CD model. The variation of the dispersion coefficient, D, with pore water velocity, v 0, and porous medium characteristics was explored in detail. The application to all experimental data of the four-parameter MIM model, which compartmentalises the pore water in the mobile-stagnant domains provided an <b>insignificant</b> <b>different</b> description of BTCs, even of the asymmetric ones.

Results suggest that these sales taxes had a statistically insignificant impact on the overall consumption of soft drinks. Chapter 3 describes an empirical study that looks at whether the 5 % sales tax on soft drinks in Ohio in 2003 had a differential impact on different socio-economic segments of the population. In line with the results described in Chapter 2, this study suggests that the impact of a tax had a homogeneous effect (and statistically <b>insignificant)</b> across <b>different</b> demographic groups. In Chapter 4 we investigate whether the demand for soda varies with the obesity rate. To this end we develop a demand model that is able to incorporate dynamic properties of this market as well as the resulting possibility that the obesity rate might alter the parameters of the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the effect of storage time and temperature on erythrocytes, platelets and leucocytes pictures of cattle and equine blood. Whole blood samples from cows (No = 6) and donkeys (No = 6) were subdivided into two equal groups: refrigerator group (4 °C) and room temperature group (30 °C). Hematological analysis was performed by automatic blood cell counter at 0, 24, 30, 48, 56 and 72 h. The results revealed that donkey and cow’s blood showed <b>insignificant</b> changes in <b>different</b> hematological parameters kept at 4 °C when compared with 0 h group. Storage at room temperature affected granulocytes counts only which significantly decreased at 48, 56 and 72 h in donkey’s blood and at 72 h in cow’s blood. In conclusion, {{it is possible to}} analyze blood samples kept refrigerated or at room temperature for erythrocytes and platelets picture within 3 days from blood collection in cattle and equines. On the other hand, granulocytes count must be carried out before 48 h from blood collection in donkeys and before 72 h in cow’s blood kept at room temperature...|$|R
40|$|Six natural, blue colored spinel {{crystals}} {{were studied}} chemically by electron microprobe and laser ablation {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (LAICP- MS) techniques and optically by UV–VIS–NIR–MIR spectroscopy in the range 30, 000 – 2, 000 cm− 1 to investigate the causes of their blue color hues. The positions of the absorption bands vary only marginally with the principal composition of the samples (gahnite vs. spinel s. s.). Although blue colors in spinels are frequently the result of various electronic processes in Fe cations, we demonstrate by comparison with synthetic Co-bearing samples that Co acts as an important chromophore also in natural spinels. Already at concentration levels of a few ppm (e. g., > 10 ppm), cobalt gives rise to absorption bands at 18, 000, 17, 000 and 16, 000 cm− 1 that result in distinct blue coloration. In spinels with <b>insignificant</b> Co contents, <b>different</b> shades of paler blue (from purplish to greenish blue) colors are caused by electronic transitions in TFe 2 +, MFe 2 +, MFe 3 + and Fe 2 +–Fe 3 + cation pairs...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was planned to follow up the effect of famous mixture used as a hypoglycemic {{traditional}} medicine in Saudi Arabia on diabetic albino rats and their effects on some biochemical parameter as DHEA. This study also aimed to study the effect of each plants alone to illustrate the most powerful one of them. The present study was carried out on eighty adult male albino rats (120 + 20 gm b. wt). They were randomly divided into eight groups. First group conserved as control group. The others groups received alloxan to become diabetic. The second group conserved as diabetic, the third group treated {{with a mixture of}} plants (0. 5 gm/ 120 gm b. wt). From he fourth to eight group,the rats treated with Nigella sativa (0. 25 gm/ 120 gm b. wt),Aloe vera,Ferulaassa-foetid,Boswellia Carterii Birdw and Commiphora myrrha respectively (0. 5 gm/ 120 gm b. wt.). Our result showed that the body weight was reduced significantly in diabetic group and Nigella sativa treated group. On the other hand, treatment with commiphora myrrha revealed significant increase in body weight gain, while mixture and Aloe vera treated rats recorded insignificant change. Diabetic rats revealed a significant decrease in serum glucose and DHEA-S levels and liver glycogen content, while insignificant difference was recoded in all treated groups. A significant decrease in serum insulin level was observed in diabetic group, Nigella sativa and Ferula assa-foetida treated groups, but <b>insignificant</b> <b>different</b> was recorded in the rest treated groups throughout the experiment.

40|$|Objectives: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common type of compression neuropathy where the median nerve passes beneath the transverse carpal ligament. Regarding demographic specialities of the population, most of these patients are suffering from other hand and upper limb disorders such as trigger finger, carpometacarpal osteoartitis, hand tumors, and the other compression neuropaties. Our aim was to compare postoperative hand disability of the patients who underwent only median nerve decompression (Group A) with the patients operated for carpal {{tunnel syndrome}} and other hand disordes at the same session (Group B). Methods: A series of 43 patients who were operated for carpal tunnel syndrome (Group A) or carpal tunnel syndrome with another hand operation at the same session (Group A) were compared pre- and postoperatively by QuickDASH questionnaire (The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Turkish by Hacettepe University School of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation). Results: In cases of Group A, the average DASH score dropped from 81. 9 to 29. 8 and pre- and postoperatively, using of patients their hands and degree of satisfaction was found to be statistically significant different (ANOVA F= 60. 2, p< 0. 01). In cases of Group B, the average DASH score dropped from 81. 9 to 34. 2 and pre-and postoperatively, using of patients their hands and degree of satisfaction was found to be statistically significant different (ANOVA F= 44. 6, p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Comparison of pre- and postoperative DASH scores between the patients who underwent only carpal tunnel surgery and the patients who underwent combined surgery was statistically <b>insignificant</b> <b>different</b> (ANOVA F= 0. 022, p= 0. 883 and F= 0. 471, p= 0. 496, respectively). In both groups, none of our patients encountered with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, because of extreme sensitivity, desensitisation treatment was applied to 4 patients.

40|$|AbstractThe hypolipidemic {{effect of}} fat spreads {{containing}} flaxseed oil (rich plant source of longchain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) represents {{the aim of}} the present study. Such effect was biologically evaluated through assessment of four biochemical parameters that reflect the blood serum lipid profile, namely total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoproteins and triglyceride levels during a feeding experiment for 8 successive weeks using male albino rats. Eight fat spreads containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % total fat were used; of these, four spreads were formulated using palm and flaxseed oils while the other four treatments were prepared by palm and soybean oils at the same concentrations. Results showed that fat spreads containing flaxseed oil exerted reducing effect on total cholesterol, LDL levels, TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios at higher rates compared with those containing soybean oil or pharmaceutical product especially after 8 weeks of feeding experiment. Levels of HDL in animals administered the studied fat spreads were lowered at significant to <b>insignificant</b> <b>different</b> rates. Flaxseed oil exerted its beneficial effect when it was incorporated into formulation at high amounts since G 6 (FPB 3, containing 29. 5 % flaxseed oil) and G 8 (FPB 4, containing 39 % flaxseed oil) animal groups exerted higher/comparative levels of HDL after 8 weeks of feeding compared to the initial concentration. Concerning triglycerides levels, all studied groups (except G 8, FPB 4) and controls showed significant higher levels at the end of feeding experiment compared to initial concentration. On the other hand, animals received the highest% of flaxseed oil (G 8, FPB 4) exerted its healthy effect as triglycerides levels were decreased from 104. 3 mg/dL at zero time to 92. 7 mg/dL after 4 weeks of feeding with decreasing rate of 11. 1 %, another reducing effect was noted after 8 weeks as triglycerides levels were significantly decreased to 79. 7 mg/dL (decreasing rate of 23. 6 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of three leguminous green manures viz. Trifolium alexandrianum, Medicago polymorpha and Melilotus parviflora on growth, yield and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) colonization in maize (Zea mays L.) was examined and compared with recommended NPK fertilizers. The three green manuring plants contained 4. 44, 2. 45 and 3. 17 % nitrogen; 0. 065, 0. 089 and - 0. 122 % phosphorus and 1. 24, 1. 89 and 0. 8 % potassium, respectively. NPK fertilizers suppressed VAM colonization whereas green manures generally favoured it. The study of correlation coefficient revealed {{that there was}} a variable pattern of correlation between N, P and K contents of green manures and various parameters of VAM colonization, at different growth stages. All the soil amendments enhanced shoot growth in terms of length and biomass, at all the three growth stages. Effect of Trifolium was similar to that of NPK fertilizers while Medicago and Melilotus were proved significantly superior than NPK fertilizers in increasing shoot biomass. Negative and significant correlation of shoot length and biomass with N contents of green manures was observed whereas with P content the correlation was positive and highly significant. Root length and biomass was increased by NPK fertilizers and either of the green manure amendment. Pattern of correlation of root length and biomass with N and P contents of green manures was similar to that of shoot. Highest cob biomass was recorded in mixed green manure followed by Medicago and Melilotus, respectively. Difference was significant as compared with control, NPK fertilizers and Trifolium. A highly significant and negative correlation was recorded between cob biomass and N content of the green manures. Pattern of correlation of root and shoot growth and cob biomass with various parameters of VAM colonization was variable and <b>insignificant</b> at <b>different</b> growth stages...|$|R
40|$|A general {{consensus}} hold by scholars, parents, educators, {{and policy makers}} is that parental involvement benefits children’s academic growth and behavioral outcome. However, recent research on over-involved parenting challenges this mainstream view. In my thesis, I examine whether increased parental involvement leads to diminishing returns or negative effects on children’s outcomes through focusing on three important dimensions of parental involvement within a familial context: cultural cultivation, parental expectations, and parental communication. Using data from four waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K), from 2000 to 2007, the quadratic model reveals significant curvilinear effects of parental involvement on children’s educational and behavioral outcomes and its variations across different dimensions of involvement and grade levels in early childhood. I argue {{that the effects of}} parental involvement, whether these effects are positive, negative, or <b>insignificant,</b> vary by <b>different</b> intensities of involvement. I find that both the short- and long-term curvilinear effects of parental involvement on educational outcomes become stronger as children approach to their early adolescence, but the effects of parental involvement on behavioral outcome diminish over time. These findings suggest the complex relationship between parental involvement and children’s educational and behavioral development and the need for reconsidering the role of parental involvement for improving children’s outcomes...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{continuous}} time state estimation framework that unifies traditionally individual tasks of smoothing, tracking, and forecasting (STF), {{for a class}} of targets subject to smooth motion processes, e. g., the target moves with nearly constant acceleration or affected by <b>insignificant</b> noises. Fundamentally <b>different</b> from the conventional Markov transition formulation, the state process is modeled by a continuous trajectory function of time (FoT) and the STF problem is formulated as an online data fitting problem {{with the goal of}} finding the trajectory FoT that best fits the observations in a sliding time-window. Then, the state of the target, whether the past (namely, smoothing), the current (filtering) or the near-future (forecasting), can be inferred from the FoT. Our framework releases stringent statistical modeling of the target motion in real time, and is applicable to a broad range of real world targets of significance such as passenger aircraft and ships which move on scheduled, (segmented) smooth paths but little statistical knowledge is given about their real time movement and even about the sensors. In addition, the proposed STF framework inherits the advantages of data fitting for accommodating arbitrary sensor revisit time, target maneuvering and missed detection. The proposed method is compared with state of the art estimators in scenarios of either maneuvering or non-maneuvering target.
