500|$|Wolstencroft {{stated that}} after {{watching}} the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: [...] "I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, {{but she was so}} nice, but how could you, but well done'." [...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E
500|$|By this time, Vespasian's {{position}} in Rome was secure. The details of Alexander's career {{under the new}} emperor remain unclear. A damaged papyrus refers to Alexander as holding the position of [...] "Praetorian Prefect", which is open to two interpretations. It could indicate his rank during Titus' campaign in 70, which would mean that he held his own independent imperium (commanding authority). According to another view, it means that he became Prefect of the Praetorian Guard at Rome, which in later years became a common position for former Prefects of Egypt. In either case, Alexander attained a {{position in}} the Roman Empire that was unparalleled for a man of Jewish birth, not to mention one who suffered from the further stigma of an Egyptian origin. The xenophobic speaker of Juvenal's first Satire, composed in the late 1st or early in the 2nd century AD, complains of passing the Forum's triumphal statues, [...] "where some Egyptian Arabarch's <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> set up his titles. At his image it's right to do more than piss!" [...] This is very likely a reference to Alexander.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{attracted}} controversy for its second episode, which saw {{the demise of}} a main character after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The scene attracted over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to the}} television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Following the complaints, the BBC admitted that the scene [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] several viewers, but defended it as it was showing the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated the scene was shocking, but [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative". However the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come in the scene. The controversy sparked a response from comedian Charlie Brooker in his Guardian column, stating: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> confound expectation." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} met by anti-Trump protests in the first-stage {{finishing}} town of New Paltz, New York, where demonstrators held placards reading [...] "Fight Trumpism", [...] "Die Yuppie $cum", [...] "The Art of the Deal = The Rich Get Richer" [...] and [...] "Trump = Lord of the Flies". The 1989 race was won by the Norwegian rider Dag Otto Lauritzen of the American team 7-Eleven, although there was some controversy about the result as Belgian rider Eric Vanderaerden, who had won four stages and was expected {{to take the lead}} in the general classification in the final stage time trial in Atlantic City but took a wrong turn following a race motorbike. The Soviet rider Viatcheslav Ekimov, who took part as an amateur, won the first stage of the race (following a prologue time trial). Articles published the following year reported that Ekimov [...] "had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> win a stage as an amateur... and some pros reportedly rewarded him by jamming a feed bag into his wheel", and that he [...] "threatened to win the Tour de Trump last year as an amateur before the pros banded together to eliminate any chance he had of winning". Nonetheless, the first edition of the race was described as [...] "a smashing success" [...] in Sports Illustrated, which noted: [...] "If you could get past the name, the Tour de Trump, without losing your lunch, and if you could somehow divorce the sporting event from the excess baggage that went with it... what you had was a pretty nice bicycle race".|$|E
2500|$|With Pawsey's help, £630,000 {{was raised}} from the Ford Foundation {{to build the}} Culgoora radio-{{heliograph}}. Years later he was to admit [...] "When I think back I wonder how I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> do it." [...] The heliograph stayed in operation for 17 years from 1967, providing {{a huge amount of}} data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The heliograph also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't think I would have learned much more, and I don't think I would have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>to</b> tackle some of the things I tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E
