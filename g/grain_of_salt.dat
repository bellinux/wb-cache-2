As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E

500|$|When {{an animal}} is ritually {{slaughtered}} (shechted) the raw meat is traditionally cut, rinsed and salted, prior to cooking.

2500|$|There are varying {{accounts}} regarding Romanos III's {{motivation for}} attacking the Mirdasids. According to medieval Arabic chroniclers Yahya of Antioch (d. 1066) and Ibn al-Adim (d. 1272), Romanos resolved to avenge {{the defeat of}} his governor in Antioch, whom he dismissed. However, the contemporary Byzantine historians John Skylitzes and Michael Psellos hold that the impending campaign was motivated by Romanos's quest for glory. Despite, or rather because of, his complete lack of military experience, Romanos was eager to imitate the deeds of Basil II and his predecessors; according to Psellos, he wanted to emulate the ancient Roman emperors such as Trajan and Augustus, or even Alexander the Great. Historian Suhayl Zakkar suggests {{that all of the}} above versions should be held with a <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> and asserts that Romanos most likely acted to ensure Aleppo's independence from Byzantium's main Arab enemy, the Fatimids, who he believed could conquer the city and its emirate in the wake of Salih's death. This is indicated by the presence in Romanos's entourage of Mansur ibn Lu'lu', the former ruler of Aleppo, who Romanos likely sought to install in the Mirdasids' place. Moreover, in a letter he sent to Nasr and Thimal, Romanos expressed concerns that the Mirdasid emirs' [...] "enemies ... might wrest the city from them" [...] due to their [...] "youthfulness" [...] and requested they hand over Aleppo to him in exchange for a payment.|$|E
