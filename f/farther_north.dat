5|$|Hurricane Karl {{was unusual}} in several aspects. It {{developed}} {{late in the}} hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, over waters colder than the standard limit for tropical cyclone formation. It marked the farthest-north development of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone on record. While the 1991 unnamed hurricane was <b>farther</b> <b>north,</b> it became a subtropical storm late on October 31, and had moved south by November 1. Karl attained Category 1 hurricane status <b>farther</b> <b>north</b> than any other storm (in any month) until the 1991 unnamed hurricane became a hurricane at a higher latitude. The storm's record was also surpassed by Hurricane Noel in 2001. Karl was reported {{at the time to}} be the farthest-east hurricane during the last 10days of the month of November. Additionally, it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45.0°N, at which point it became extratropical; only Hurricane Lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane <b>farther</b> <b>north</b> in the month of November.|$|E

5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana.

5|$|This short freeway {{was opened}} in late 1960 or early 1961 {{as the north}} end of a new US23 freeway around Bay City. The freeway was {{extended}} <b>farther</b> <b>north</b> to the Standish area in 1967; M-13 was extended north to replace the US23 designation along the latter's former routing through Pinconning.

5|$|All of M-63's routing {{was part}} of US33 before that highway's {{truncation}} south of Niles in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used <b>farther</b> <b>north</b> in Lake and Osceola counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway {{in the early part}} of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the St. Joseph River, the Blossomland Bridge, has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s.|$|E

50|$|The Northern Limit Line is {{considered}} by South Korea to be the sea boundary between itself and North Korea, while North Korea disagrees and states that the boundary is <b>farther</b> south. <b>North</b> Korean fishing vessels often wander into the area and are frequently chased away by South Korean patrol vessels.

5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns.

About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one man was killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a second man was mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} <b>farther</b> <b>north,</b> {{and closer to}} Grand Rapids, it is lined with more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width and over a mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E

A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00UTC on October21, encompassing areas of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia intensified, the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoacán; {{a tropical storm}} warning supplemented this for areas <b>farther</b> <b>north</b> and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October23.

2500|$|The landmass of Monti della Laga {{has a more}} {{rounded off}} {{characteristic}} in comparison {{with many of the}} other Apennine areas. This phenomenon is because the soil is far more arenaceous (sandy) and has marble formations that are not found {{in other parts of the}} central Apennine Mountains <b>farther</b> to <b>north</b> and the south. Hence the geological name given to the area, [...] "Formazione di Laga". More characteristic of the Apennine mountains are soils, rocks, and land formations made up of coal and dolomitic limestone.|$|R
