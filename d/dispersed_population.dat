5|$|Exmoor was {{designated}} a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The Exmoor National Park is primarily an upland {{area with a}} <b>dispersed</b> <b>population</b> living mainly in small villages and hamlets. The largest settlements are Porlock, Dulverton, Lynton, and Lynmouth, which together contain almost 40% of the park's population. Lynton and Lynmouth are combined into one parish and are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Exmoor was once a Royal forest and hunting ground, covering , which was sold off in 1818. Several areas within the Exmoor National Park have been declared Sites of Special Scientific Interest due to their flora and fauna. This title earns the site some legal protection from development, damage and neglect. In 1993 an environmentally sensitive area was established within Exmoor.|$|E

The paper first outlines a CAI system capable of reaching <b>dispersed</b> <b>populations</b> without excessive costs (i. e., the system requires only 110 bits per second communications capability for each student terminal). This makes the service economically feasible [...] Next, models of several communications alternatives for the system are provided. The results of this modeling constitute approximate minimum cost communication designs for many configurations of population dispersal [...] Finally, some basic economic trade-offs and implementation alternatives are described which are relevant to educators who'must decide whether or not to use CAI for certain student populations.

They ate clams and shellfish from the Pacific Ocean, as well as guinea pigs and birds. Chavín people grew some maize and potatoes during this phase.

Ongoing scientific studies have indicated there have been earthquakes associated with at least ten Canadian volcanoes, including: Mount Garibaldi, Hoodoo Mountain, Castle Rock, Mount Cayley, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Silverthrone Caldera, Mount Meager, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E

500|$|Of the 129 MSPs, 73 {{are elected}} to {{represent}} first past the post constituencies and {{are known as}} [...] "Constituency MSPs". Voters choose one member to represent the constituency, and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP. The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland, prior to the 2005 {{reduction in the number}} of Scottish [...] MPs, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP. Currently, the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors. Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland, this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands, where the bulk of Scotland's population live, and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country, which have a low population density. The island archipelagos of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors, due to their <b>dispersed</b> <b>population.</b> If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament, this triggers a by-election in his or her constituency, where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.|$|E
40|$|Processes of {{conflict}} and domination have historically influenced and continue to influence patterns of mass migration; in some cases, over time shaping the formation of diasporas. These processes have contributed to a rapidly growing body of literature exploring various aspects {{of what has been}} termed the migration-development nexus. Contrary to early arguments suggesting that migrants assimilate fully into the societies in which they settle, it is largely observed today that migrants inhabit transnational spaces where they varyingly maintain ties with their ‘home countries’. More recently, literature has acknowledged the ways subsequent generations raised outside the ‘homeland’ are socialized into transnational social fields and thus also lead transnational lives. A range of local, national and global actors have recognized the importance and potential of emigrant populations to transnational processes. Specifically, the ‘sending state’ has been an integral actor in the cultivation and mobilization of its <b>dispersed</b> <b>populations.</b> Relying on a host of mechanisms to ‘court’ their <b>dispersed</b> <b>populations,</b> states adopt policies in an attempt to institutionalize relationships with their diasporas. This portfolio situates itself within this relatively recent, yet quickly growing body of literature {{on the role of the}} state in transnational processes. Grounding my analysis in the Eritrean transnational social field, this portfolio locates the role of the Liberation Front-turned-State in engaging its <b>dispersed</b> <b>populations</b> over time. I emphasize the continuities, changes and ruptures that have highlighted and arise from Eritrean state-diaspora relationships since the formation of the Eritrean diaspora. In the face of significant legitimacy loss, relationships between the state and its local and <b>dispersed</b> <b>populations</b> have increasingly become marked by control and coercion aimed at ideologically and physically disciplining citizens. While my analysis is contextually situated within the Eritrean transnational social field, I acknowledge that the issues I explore are located within broader global processes. Thus, my analysis fluidly shifts between individual, national and global levels of analysis to highlight the differing and competing political considerations that are at play at each level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To better {{understand}} the evolution of dispersal in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, we study difference equation models of populations that reproduce and disperse in a landscape consisting of k patches. The connectivity of the patches and costs of dispersal are determined by a k×k column substochastic matrix S, where Sij represents the fraction of dispersing individuals from patch j that end up in patch i. Given S, a dispersal strategy is a k× 1 vector whose ith entry gives the probability pi that individuals disperse from patch i. If all of the pi’s are the same, then the dispersal strategy is called unconditional; otherwise it is called conditional. For two competing populations of unconditional dispersers, we prove that the slower <b>dispersing</b> <b>population</b> (i. e., the population with the smaller dispersal probability) displaces the faster <b>dispersing</b> <b>population.</b> Alternatively, for populations of conditional dispersers without any dispersal costs (i. e., S is column stochastic and all patches can support a population), we prove {{that there is a}} one parameter family of strategies that resists invasion attempts by all other strategies...|$|R
