5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the <b>hadal</b> <b>zone,</b> while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} <b>hadal</b> <b>zone.</b> The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins have conquered most sea habitats, on an {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} depths. Some species, such as Cidaris abyssicola, can live down to several thousands of meters deep. Many genera are totally indentured to the abyssal zone, such as many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, or the strange genus Dermechinus. One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live only in the <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones</b> is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|R
50|$|These creatures live in very {{demanding}} environments, {{such as the}} abyssal or <b>hadal</b> <b>zones,</b> which, being thousands of meters below the surface, are almost completely devoid of light. The water is between 3 and 10 degrees Celsius and has low oxygen levels. Due to the depth, the pressure is between 20 and 1,000 bars. Creatures that live hundreds or even thousands of meters deep in the ocean have adapted to the high pressure, lack of light, and other factors.|$|R
50|$|Though uncommon, {{this species}} is known from all {{tropical}} and subtropical oceans. It {{occurs in the}} abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones</b> below a depth of 3,110 m. It is bottom-dwelling in nature, although one individual has been captured from the water column in the Gulf of Panama. Its diet consists of polychaete worms and crustaceans, such as isopods and amphipods. Reproduction is oviparous, possibly with pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass as in {{other members of the}} family.|$|R
500|$|The {{aphotic zone}} can be {{subdivided}} into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the bathyal zone, extending from {{a depth of}} 1000metres down to 3000metres, with water temperature decreasing from [...] to [...] as depth increases. Next is the abyssal zone, extending from a depth of 3000metres down to 6000metres. The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches, and {{is known as the}} <b>hadal</b> <b>zone.</b> This, the deepest oceanic zone, extends from a depth of 6000metres down to approximately 11000metres. Abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone, at depths from 3000 to 6000metres.|$|E
2500|$|The benthic {{zones are}} aphotic and {{correspond}} to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about [...] The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000m. Lastly, the <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.|$|E

5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones</b> is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|R
50|$|A {{black smoker}} or deep sea vent {{is a type}} of {{hydrothermal}} vent found on the seabed, typically in the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones</b> at spreading centers. They appear as black, chimney-like structures that emit a cloud of black material. Black smokers typically emit particles with high levels of sulfur-bearing minerals, or sulfides. Black smokers are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below Earth's crust comes through the ocean floor (water may attain temperatures above 400 °C). This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides. When it comes in contact with cold ocean water, many minerals precipitate, forming a black, chimney-like structure around each vent. The deposited metal sulfides can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time.|$|R
5000|$|Flatfishes {{are found}} in oceans worldwide, ranging from the Arctic, through the tropics, to Antarctica. Most species {{are found in}} depths between 0 and 500 m, but a few have been {{recorded}} from depths in excess of 1500 m. None have been confirmed from the abyssal or <b>hadal</b> <b>zones.</b> An observation of a flatfish from the Bathyscaphe Trieste {{at the bottom of}} the Mariana Trench at a depth of almost 11 km has been questioned by fish experts, and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid. Among the deepwater species, Symphurus thermophilus lives in congregating around [...] "ponds" [...] of sulphur at hydrothermal vents on the seafloor. No other flatfish is known from hydrothermal vents. Many species will enter brackish or fresh water, and a smaller number of soles (families Achiridae and Soleidae) and tonguefish (Cynoglossidae) are entirely restricted to fresh water.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} organisms include jellyfish, viperfish, tube worms and sea cucumbers. The <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> can reach far below 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) deep; the deepest known extends to 10,911 meters (35,814 ft). At such depths the {{pressure}} in the <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> exceeds [...] Lack of light and extreme pressure makes {{this part of the}} ocean difficult to explore.|$|E
50|$|The {{aphotic zone}} is further divided into {{additional}} zones: the bathyal zone, the abyssal zone, and the <b>hadal</b> <b>zone.</b> The bathyal zone extends from 200 m to 2000 m. The abyssal zone extends from 2000 m to 6000 m. The <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> spans from depths of 6000 m {{to the ocean}} floor. Creatures in these areas {{must be able to}} live in complete darkness.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> (named {{after the}} realm of Hades, the underworld in Greek mythology), {{also known as the}} hadopelagic zone and {{composed}} of trench zones, is the delineation for the deepest trenches in the ocean. The <b>hadal</b> <b>zone</b> is found from a depth {{to the bottom of the}} ocean of around 6000 to 11000 m and exists in long but narrow topographic V-shaped depressions.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones,</b> {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|R
40|$|Eurythenes gryllus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} amphipod species, occurring in every ocean with a depth range covering the bathyal, abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones.</b> Previous studies, however, indicated the existence of several genetically and morphologically divergent lineages, questioning the assumption of its cosmopolitan and eurybathic distribution. For the first time, its genetic diversity was explored at the global scale (Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans) by analyzing nuclear (28 S rDNA) and mitochondrial (COI, 16 S rDNA) sequence data using various species delimitation methods in a phylogeographic context. Nine putative species-level clades were identified within E. gryllus. A clear distinction was observed between samples collected at bathyal versus abyssal depths, with a genetic break occurring around 3, 000 m. Two bathyal and two abyssal lineages showed a widespread distribution, while five other abyssal lineages each seemed to be restricted to a single ocean basin. The observed higher diversity in the abyss compared to the bathyal zone stands in contrast to the depth-differentiation hypothesis. Our results indicate that, despite the more uniform environment of the abyss and its presumed lack of obvious isolating barriers, abyssal populations might be more likely to show population differentiation and undergo speciation events than previously assumed. Potential factors influencing species' origins and distributions, such as hydrostatic pressure, are discussed. In addition, morphological findings coincided with the molecular clades. Of all specimens available for examination, those of the bipolar bathyal clade seemed the most similar to the 'true' E. gryllus. We present the first molecular evidence for a bipolar distribution in a macro-benthic deep-sea organism...|$|R
40|$|Extreme marine environments {{cover more}} than 50 % of the Earth’s surface and offer many {{opportunities}} for investigating the biological responses and adaptations of organisms to stressful life conditions. Extreme marine environments are sometimes associated with ephemeral and unstable ecosystems, but can host abundant, often endemic and well-adapted meiofaunal species. In this review, we present an integrated view of the biodiversity, ecology and physiological responses of marine meiofauna inhabiting several extreme marine environments (mangroves, submarine caves, Polar ecosystems, hypersaline areas, hypoxic/anoxic environments, hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, carcasses/sunken woods, deep-sea canyons, deep hypersaline anoxic basins [DHABs] and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones).</b> Foraminiferans, nematodes and copepods are abundant in almost all of these habitats and are dominant in deep-sea ecosystems. The presence and dominance of some other taxa that are normally less common may be typical of certain extreme conditions. Kinorhynchs are particularly well adapted to cold seeps and other environments that experience drastic changes in salinity, rotifers are well represented in polar ecosystems and loriciferans {{seem to be the}} only metazoan able to survive multiple stressors in DHABs. As well as natural processes, human activities may generate stressful conditions, including deoxygenation, acidification and rises in temperature. The behaviour and physiology of different meiofaunal taxa, such as some foraminiferans, nematode and copepod species, can provide vital information on how organisms may respond to these challenges and can provide a warning signal of anthropogenic impacts. From an evolutionary perspective, the discovery of new meiofauna taxa from extreme environments very often sheds light on phylogenetic relationships, while understanding how meiofaunal organisms are able to survive or even flourish in these conditions can explain evolutionary pathways. Finally, there are multiple potential economic benefits to be gained from ecological, biological, physiological and evolutionary studies of meiofauna in extreme environments. Despite all the advantages offered by meiofauna studies from extreme environments, there is still an urgent need to foster meiofauna research in terms of composition, ecology, biology and physiology focusing on extreme environments...|$|R

40|$|The abyssal macrobenthos of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench (KKT) {{area was}} sampled {{for the first}} time using a {{fine-meshed}} camera-epibenthic sledge (C-EBS) during the German–Russian KuramBio expedition 2012 (RV Sonne, 223 cruise). Crustaceans of the order Isopoda were one of the dominant macrobenthic taxa, and the family Munnopsidae was the most abundant and diverse among 17 collected asellotan families, comprising about 48 % of all isopods. During the KuramBio expedition no less than 80 species of 28 genera and eight subfamilies of Munnopsidae were collected with 21 EBS hauls at 12 stations. About 80 % species are new to science and half of the genera and the subfamily Lipomerinae are recorded {{for the first time}} in the Northwest Pacific. The most abundant and speciose subfamily was Eurycopinae (58 % of all specimens and 29 % of species), followed by Ilyarachninae (12 % and 16 %). Most species are rare and occur with low abundance at one or few stations. Ten most numerous species belonging to the genera Eurycope (5 species), Microcope (2), Disconectes (1), Ilyarachna (1) and Aspidarachna (1) comprised 68 % of all munnopsids. The species Eurycope sp. 1 and Microcope ovata (Birstein, 1970) were the most abundant and frequent species, occurring at all stations. The highest abundance of Munnopsidae and high diversity, with 32 species, occurred at station 3 – 9 on the western slope of the KKT. The cluster analysis of the Bray–Curtis similarity shows a low similarity between stations. The least similar was station 1 - 10, with only 26 % similarity with other stations. Low similarity also characterized station 3 – 9 (34 %). The comparison with known data revealed differences in species composition of Munnopsidae of the abyssal plain of the KKT area and the fauna of adjacent bathyal and <b>hadal</b> <b>zones.</b> Similar ratios of the munnopsid subfamilies and genera and some similar species have been revealed for the KuramBio and ANDEEP areas...|$|R
40|$|There are few {{biological}} datasets {{that span}} large bathymetric ranges with sufficient resolution to identify trends across the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> transition <b>zone,</b> particularly over multiple trenches. Here, scavenging Amphipoda {{were collected from}} three trenches in the South Pacific Ocean at bathyal to hadal depths. Diversity and community structure were examined from stations within the Kermadec Trench (1490 – 9908 m) and New Hebrides Trench (2000 – 6948 m) and additional data were included from the South Fiji Basin (4000 m) and Peru-Chile Trench (4602 – 8074 m). The hadal community structure of the Kermadec and New Hebrides trenches were distinct from the surrounding abyssal and bathyal depths and correlated to hydrostatic pressure and POC flux. Low POC flux in the New Hebrides Trench and South Fiji Basin best explained the dissimilarity in abyssal community structure {{from those of the}} disparate Kermadec and Peru-Chile trenches. POC flux also best explained patterns in hadal community structure with the Kermadec and New Hebrides Trench communities showing greater similarity to each other than to the eutrophic Peru-Chile Trench. Hydrostatic pressure was the strongest driver of intra-trench assemblage composition in all trench environments. A unimodal pattern of species diversity, peaking between 4000 and 5000 m, was best explained by hydrostatic pressure and temperature...|$|R

Most of these trench communities probably originate from the abyssal plains but though they indeed have evolved adaptations to high pressure and low temperatures, such as lower metabolism, intra-cellular protein-stabilising osmolytes, and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids, there is no consistent relationship between pressure and metabolic rate across these communities. Increased pressure can, instead, constrain the ontogenic or larval stages of organisms. Pressure increases 10-fold as an organism moves from sea level to a depth of 90 m, whilst pressure only doubles as an organism moves from 6000 to 11000 m. Over a geological time-scale trenches can therefore be accessible as stenobathic (adapted to a limited depth range) evolve into a eurybathic (adapted {{to a wide range of}} depths) fauna, such as grenadiers and natantian prawns. Trench communities do, nevertheless, display a contrasting degree of intra-trench endemism and inter-trench similarities at a higher taxonomic level.|$|E
