25|$|Human {{rights in}} Somalia {{throughout}} the late 20th-century and early 21st-century were considered dire, but have gradually improved {{over the following}} years. Human rights are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. They fall under the Ministry of Human Rights established in August 2013. The central authorities concurrently inaugurated a National Human Rights Day, endorsed an official Human Rights Roadmap, and completed Somalia's first National <b>Gender</b> <b>Policy.</b> A Human Rights Task Force was also established in February 2013 to firm up on the protection of individual rights. Additionally, {{the federal government in}} December 2014 organized a public awareness campaign, passed a new 54-point national Child Protection Act, and finished legislation on a Human Rights Commission bill. According to the UN's Independent Human Rights Expert on Somalia, local human rights protection has gradually improved as government institutionalization and legislative reform have taken root.|$|E

40|$|Whereas African <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and {{programmes}} {{have been}} crafted and implemented to eradicate gender gaps, this paper situates debate on {{their failure to}} attain their goal. The paper amply demonstrates that the African worldview continues to be relevant {{to the success of}} the implemented <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and programs in Africa and concludes that, unless thorough research into the African lifeworld is contacted before crafting and implementation of the <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and programs to understand the African psyche, and establish a gender communicative interchange between the African and the Western views on gender, ills of ineffectiveness will continue to be witnessed regardless of how grand the gender projects of the West may be. The paper finds this critical for the sustainability of development efforts in Africa. Insights informing the paper were gleaned from various texts, researches done on African <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and programs and the world wide website.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} and analyse the debate of ideas on <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> during 1998 - 2011. The questions raised in this thesis are; which <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> ideology has prevailed during 1998 - 2011, and which ideological orientation have the different ministers of gender equality expressed {{during the same period}} of time? I have conducted the study by analysing government publications and debate articles against a ideological framework consisting of different types of feminist theory. In order to get a result as representative as possible, I have only used the material from each of the ministers during their time in office. The research method that I have used when analyzing the material is qualitative text analysis. The findings of the study discerns three phases characterized by different <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> ideologies. The first phase, between the years 1998 and 2003, is characterized by a radical feminist <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> ideology, and the second phase, between the years 2003 and 2006, by a socialist radical feminist <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> ideology. The third phase, between the years 2006 and 2011, is influenced by a liberal <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> ideology. However, it is uncertain whether or not this phase can be recognized by a ideological framework based on feminist theory, since it is influenced by other ideological grounds as well. The result indicates a clear ideological shift from a more radical <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> to a <b>gender</b> equality <b>policy</b> less influenced by feminist theory...|$|R

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the impact that East Germany 's <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> had on the visual arts and {{especially}} women painters across four decades. The first two sections focus on women 's participation in the national art exhibitions in Dresden during the Ulbricht and Honecker years, looking at how their artwork responded to official <b>gender</b> <b>policies,</b> and at the emergence of three women – Heidrun Hegewald, Gudrun Brüne, and Doris Ziegler – as nationally prominent painters. The third section focuses on the paintings and agitations of Angela Hampel in the 1980 s {{as an example of}} a new phase in the pursuit of gender equality in East Germany, one abruptly cut short by the unification process. Ultimately this article argues that East Germany 's <b>gender</b> <b>policies,</b> despite not having achieved the stated goal of true equality, had a positive impact on women artists, and especially painters, in East Germany, increasing the number of women included in major exhibitions, encouraging greater complexity in their work, and ultimately fostering a socialist-feminist critique of lingering patriarchal biases...|$|R

Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation. This <b>gender</b> <b>policy</b> recognizes that gender equality {{is an integral part of}} IFOR’s fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR.

40|$|Mainstream {{research}} on management generally continues to ignore gender relations. Even so, over recent years {{there has been}} a major growth of international {{research on}} gender relations in organizations. Yet, most of this has focused on gender relations in lower or middle levels rather than at the apex of the organization. This book draws on research on <b>gender</b> <b>policies,</b> structures and practices of management in large Finnish corporations. It builds on earlier survey work of <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> in the 100 largest corporations in Finland, to examine, through qualitative interviews, more detailed gendered processes in seven selected corporations. These represent corporations that are ‘relatively active’, ‘moderately active’, and ‘not active’ in relation to gender equality. Key issues include contrasts between formal policies and organizational practices; different corporate contexts and individual managers’ views; definition and scope of gender policy; and the relation of <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and diversity policy. This focus on <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> is understood and located within organizational structures, most obviously gendered corporate hierarchies. Important structures include national context in relation to transnationalization, relations of headquarters and subsidiaries, and interrelations of management, policy development and <b>policy</b> implementation. <b>Gender</b> relations in practice and gender practices are considered in more detail. These women and men managers operate at the intersections of gendered transnational managerial work, careers and family-type relations, including marriage and children, or lack thereof. Women and men managers may be part of the same management levels or management teams, but have totally different family-type situations and gendered experiences. Interconnections of management, domestic life and transnationalizations are intensely gendered matters. The debate on the public/private continues to be important for both gender relations and organizational relations, but complicated through transnationalizations. The modern transnational corporation is considered in terms of gender divisions and gender power, with particular reference to top management. The concluding discussion notes implications for research and policy...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the capacity}} of a single political party - New Labour in the UK - to engender politics and policy. It draws on Kingdon's (1984) policy streams approach to demonstrate how {{with the election of}} New Labour in 1997 a window of opportunity emerged for gender changes in political representation, governance and policy terms. It argues that the commitment to engendering politics was an important step towards engendering policy, but that <b>policy</b> promoting <b>gender</b> equality does not automatically follow from more gender-balanced political representation. Despite some successes, <b>gendered</b> <b>policy</b> change is constrained by: the way <b>gendered</b> <b>policy</b> problems are framed; the slow pace of change in institutions of politics and governance; and the limits posed by policy solutions that had to fit with the dominant liberal market economic approach...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} Rwanda’s <b>gender</b> equality <b>policies</b> {{with the intention}} of contributing to the ongoing debate in the literature on the meaning of gender equality initiatives in authoritarian states. The article evaluates the transformative potential of Rwanda’s <b>gender</b> equality <b>policies</b> with reference to deep-rooted societal norms and practices within which gender inequalities are embedded. To this end, the article draws on in-depth interviews conducted in Rwanda with a range of stakeholders, as well as on documentary research. It explores the factors informing the Rwandan commitment to gender equality, and the positive developments this has brought about, before identifying five trends that threaten the transformative potential of Rwandan <b>gender</b> equality <b>policies.</b> The authors conclude that while a strong political will and target-driven policies offer opportunities for promoting gender equality, the transformative potential is jeopardized by the dominance of an underlying economic rationale; the neglect of the ‘invisible labour’ of women; the formalistic implementation of <b>gender</b> <b>policies</b> and their focus on quantitative results; the limited scope for civil society voices to influence policy; and the lack of grassroots participation...|$|R
