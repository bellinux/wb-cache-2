5|$|Following the 1936 {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War, the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of non-intervention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> between the Spanish government and rebels led by General Franco. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in any way; this became {{the policy of the}} government {{for the duration of the}} civil war. The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. Martin Tranmæl, a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranmæl and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels. Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the International Brigades. On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.|$|E
