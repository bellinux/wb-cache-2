60|$|Having thus {{recovered}} {{whatever he}} had any title to demand, he began {{to look out for}} new acquisitions. Ireland was in that age a country little known in the world. The legates sent sometimes thither from the Court of Rome, for urging the payment of annats, or directing other Church affairs, represented the inhabitants as a savage people, overrun with barbarism and superstition: for indeed no nation of Europe, where the Christian religion received so early and universal admittance, was ever so late or slow in feeling its effects upon their manners and civility.[48] Instead of refining their manners by their faith, they had suffered their faith to be corrupted by their manners; true religion being almost defaced, both in doctrine and discipline, after a long course of time, among a people wholly sunk in ignorance and barbarity. There seem to have been two reasons why the inhabitants of that island continued so long uncultivated; first, their subjection or vassalage to so many petty kings, whereof a great number is mentioned by authors, besides those four or five usually assigned to the several provinces. These princes were engaged in perpetual quarrels, in doing or revenging injuries of violence, or lust, or treachery, or injustice, which kept them all in a continual state of war. And indeed there is hardly any country, how renowned soever in ancient or modern story, which may not be traced from the like original. Neither can a nation come out from this state of confusion, until it is either reduced under one head at home, or by force or conquest becomes subject to a <b>foreign</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E

50|$|He {{played an}} active part in the Indian National {{movement}} which was gathering force in those days.

In 1928, he was the President of the Indian Central Committee to co-operate with the Simon Commission. The Committee prepared a well-argued report asking for Dominion Status for India. When the Viceregal announcement came granting Dominion Status as the ultimate goal for India, Sir Sankaran Nair retired from active politics. He died in 1934, aged 77.|$|E
50|$|In July 1927, the Nationalist Government {{headquartered}} in Nanking under Chiang Kai-shek established the Shanghai Special City Government (上海特别市政府). The city remained remarkably prosperous despite tripartite struggles between Nationalist, Communist and warlord factions {{in various parts}} of China, largely on the account of the International Settlement and the French Concession. The Nationalist controlled Chinese walled city in the Nanshi area (南市) and the northern Zhabei District were small in comparison to the areas under <b>foreign</b> <b>administration,</b> held a burgeoning population and were unsuitable for expansion. As a result, the Nanking Government considered large scale redevelopment a key task and in July 1929 deciding to proceed with the acquisition of land in the north east of the city adjacent to the Huangpu River. In 1922, this area had also been earmarked by Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Chinese Republic, as the center of China's development plans with a view to Shanghai becoming a golbal commercial centre. By 1931, the new Shanghai Special City Government had approved and started work on the Greater Shanghai Plan utilising ideas drawn from British expert Ebenezer Howard's 1902 book Garden Cities of Tomorrow.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to recover the voice, if not of the {{indigenous}} colonized people of the Andean region in South America, then at least of the mestizos who lived and produced theater in the Viceroyalty of Peru during the 17 th and 18 th centuries. The voice of the colonized was silenced not only by the imposition of a <b>foreign</b> <b>administration</b> and culture, but also by the Eurocentric perspective used to narrate the events pertaining to the conquest and colonization of the New World. The post-colonial reading of four religious comedies, written in Quechua by scholars like Espinosa Medrano and other anonymous playwrights, provided a better understanding of the way the indigenous society perceived the Spanish colonization. The analysis of El hijo pródigo, Rapto de Proserpina, El pobre más rico and Usca Paucar, within the framework of post-colonial theory, revealed the elaborated syncretism of pre-Hispanic and Western elements at the core of each drama, its characters, and the message they sought to transmit. It also exposed a bifocal perspective, a displacement of the dominant colonial discourse, and the tense struggle between the native and foreign (Spanish) forms of expression, all symptoms of the New World Baroque. This outcome speaks in favor of the originality and worth of the Latin American artistic manifestation. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the place and}} function of the international law of belligerent occupation its interplays with other public international law regimes and argues that the co-Â­application of these regimes, {{as well as an}} enforcement paradigm based on the duty of non-Â­recognition of international law violations, can further the key objective of protecting the local population in occupied territory. The existence of an occupation is a matter of fact, yet many occupiers have pursued their self-Â­interest in a manner that violates the rights of the local population and the ousted sovereign. Such actions call into question the legality of the continued presence of the occupying state in foreign territory. In a notable number of contemporary cases, it may be asked whether occupying states have, in effect, transformed belligerent occupations into illegal territorial regimes. This is the first manuscript-Â­length treatment of the interplay between the law of belligerent occupation and other, complementary regimes of territorial and <b>foreign</b> <b>administration</b> in international law. It shows that the co-Â­application of these laws provides a standard for assessing the legality or illegality of an occupying states actions and of a belligerent occupation regime. The work demonstrates that the co-Â­application of the laws of territoriality, inter-Â­state use of force, self-Â­determination of peoples, and human rights law can enhance the interpretation, application, and enforcement of the law of belligerent occupation. The work proposes a comprehensive approach to enforcing prohibitions of internationally unlawful acts in time of belligerent occupation. It identifies a category of illegal territorial regimes and charts an approach for operationalising the duty of non-Â­recognition of these regimes violations through inter-Â­state relations...|$|E

40|$|In {{modern times}} customs {{services}} are the institutions entrusted with monitoring trade through collecting duties on imports and exports, preventing smuggling and patrolling national boundaries. The Chinese Maritime Customs Service of the Republic was imbued {{with many of}} these modern ideas. The Service maintained an extensive network of Customs houses both along China's coastline and inland. It maintained harbours and lighthouses and also established a preventive service to counteract smuggling. The comparisons, however, end here. The Chinese Maritime Customs Service was a uniquely cosmopolitan institution that emerged {{as a product of}} the Opium Wars and the Unequal Treaties. Headed by successive British Inspectors General, Sir Robert Hart (1863 - 1911), Sir Francis Aglen (1911 - 1927) and Sir Frederick Maze (1929 - 1943), the Service recruited foreigners to administer the Customs establishments. This dissertation examines the fate of the Customs foreign Inspectorate during the 1923 - 1937 period. By examining episodes such as the Canton Customs controversy of 1923; the Canton-Hong Kong Boycott 1925 - 1926; the Customs succession crisis; negotiations surrounding the proposed Hong Kong-China Trade and Customs Agreement 1929 - 30; the seizure of the Tientsin Customs 1930; and the loss of Customs houses in the northeast to Manchukuo authorities in 1923 - 1933, the themes of resistance and change are brought to the fore. The <b>foreign</b> <b>administration</b> of the Service encountered growing resistance {{on the part of the}} Chinese nationalists and it also faced resistance from the British establishment in China who no longer perceived the Service as an ongoing concern. To ensure its survival the Service had to change and in doing so embrace the Nationalist regime. Although during this period the significance of Customs revenue to the Chinese government and. to foreign investors was unsurpassed, the Service itself was undergoing a steady decline as it was pulled deeper into the machinations of China's political sphere without a British anchor for security.
