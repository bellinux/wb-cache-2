40|$|International audienceThe {{dispersion}} {{equation of}} electron whistler waves {{in a cold}} plasma with two light ions of comparable <b>gyrofrequencies</b> and heavy charged particulates is derived. It is valid in a very wide frequency range above the highest ion cutoff frequency when the wave frequency is essentially less than the electron plasma frequency. The derived electron whistler dispersion law is expressed through the relative contents of the two light ions and the electrons, {{as well as the}} characteristic frequencies of the magnetized plasma, as the lower hybrid resonance frequency, the two highest ion cutoff frequencies, the <b>gyrofrequencies</b> of the light ions, and the electron gyro- and plasma frequencies. The approximation of vanishingly small <b>gyrofrequencies</b> of the heavy ions permits to determine with a relevant accuracy the electron whistler dispersion law using the features of electron whistler spectrograms only. Estimates of the relative charge density of the light ions are obtained and the dispersion laws of the adjacent branches, i. e., the electron whistler waves and the so-called ion cyclotron whistlers are calculated. For the electron whistler waves, the presence of negative ions can be the origin of a manyfold increase in the lower cutoff frequency; a merging effect of the cutoff frequencies of the adjacent branches can also appear...|$|R

If the negatively charged ions have the smallest specific charges among other ion species then, under similar conditions, the so-called crossover effect and the accompanying polarization sense reverse can occur at frequencies essentially greater than the ions' <b>gyrofrequencies.</b> The revealed effects are characteristic of plasmas with excess of electronegative gas molecules or dust particulates highly adhesive to electrons, i. e., almost pure ion plasmas and/or pair-ion plasmas with extra small fractions of free electrons.
