However, if the cooling system is neglected or improperly bled after filling - needing a raised <b>filling</b> <b>level</b> because the expansion tank is not the highest point in the system - the engine has a tendency to blow its head gasket. A simple solution is to use a plastic soft drink bottle with the bottom removed, fitted with a rubber O ring seal on the flange at the cap end for filling. Because radiators (typical life 100,000 miles), generally have only just sufficient cooling capacity when new, in order to help get the engine to operating temperature quickly, silting causes significant problems. Coolant changes to maintain corrosion inhibitors (and stop silting) are critical on this engine.
