This activity {{increases the}} architectural {{complexity of the}} habitat, which attracts other organisms and increases local biodiversity. They start digging in the sediment {{from the time they}} settle out of the plankton and continue throughout their lifetime. They use their caudal fin and their mouths to remove debris and sediment from rocks, creating exposed surfaces on which sessile organisms actively settle (e.g., sponges, soft corals, algae). The exposure of structure also attracts a myriad of other species, including mobile invertebrates and a remarkable diversity of other fishes, from gobies and butterflyfish to grunts and snapper. The lionfish Pterois volitans started invading red grouper habitat by 2008, from Florida Bay to the Florida Keys and offshore to Pulley Ridge, a mesophotic coral reef on the West Florida Shelf west of the Dry Tortugas. Known for being extremely capable predators on small reef fish, scientists are very interested in determining the extent to which their invasion changes the <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> of associated communities.|$|E

40|$|Although {{emotional}} avoidance may be {{a critical}} factor in the pathway from psychological distress to self-injury and/or suicidality, {{little is known about the}} relative importance of differing <b>functional</b> coping <b>dynamics</b> and experiential avoidance between people with self-injury histories of differing intent (e. g., Non-Suicidal Self-Injury only vs. Non-Suicidal Self-Injury plus Suicidal Behaviour; NSSI vs. NSSI + SB). A community-based survey (N = 313; female, 81 %; ages 16 – 49 years, M = 19. 78, SD = 3. 48) explored self-reported experiential avoidance and <b>functional</b> coping <b>dynamics</b> in individuals with (i) no self-injury history (controls); (ii) a history of NSSI only; and (iii) a history of NSSI + SB. Jonckheere-Terpstra trend tests indicated that avoidance coping was higher in the NSSI and NSSI + SB groups than in controls. Emotion regulation was higher in controls than those with a history of self-injury (NSSI and NSSI + SB). Approach and reappraisal coping demonstrated significant ordered effects such that control participants were higher in these coping dynamics than those with a history of NSSI only, who, in turn, were higher than those with a history of NSSI + SB (Control > NSSI > NSSI + SB). Endorsement of the reappraisal/denial facet of experiential avoidance was most pronounced in those with a history of NSSI + SB (Control < NSSI < NSSI + SB). No significant ordered effects were observed for other dimensions of experiential avoidance. Understanding how the endorsement of <b>functional</b> coping <b>dynamics</b> and which components of experiential avoidance vary between groups with differing self-injury intent histories has important implications for treatment planning...|$|R
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>dynamics,</b> {{introduced}} {{in a previous}} paper [Physica D 138 (2000) 225 [...] 250] is analyzed, focusing on {{the formation of a}} hierarchical rule to determine the dynamics of the functional value. To study the periodic (or non-fixed) solution, the <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> is separated into fixed and non-fixed parts. It is shown that the fixed parts generate a one-dimensional map by which the dynamics of the functional values of some other parts are determined. Piecewise linear maps with multiple branches are generally created, while an arbitrary one-dimensional map can be embedded into this <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> if the initial function coincides with the identity function over a finite interval. Next, the dynamics determined by the one-dimensional map can again generate a `meta-map', which determines the dynamics of the generated map. This hierarchy of meta-rules can continue recursively. It is also shown that the dynamics can produce `meta-chaos' with an orbital instability that is stronger than exponential. The relevance of the generated hierarchy to biological and language systems is discussed, in relation with the formation of syntax of a network...|$|E
40|$|The temporo-mandibular-joint is {{a highly}} {{particular}} and complex anatomical entity {{in terms of both}} its structure and functions, which include the opening, closing, protrusion and lateral movement of the jaw. On the base of some papers previously published on the anatomy and physiology of the Temporo-Mandibular-Joint, the Authors have studied the <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> of the TMJ. The correct postural and functional relationships between the various components of the joint are controlled by a series of biomechanical restrictions that guide and condition its movements. The role of biomechanical restriction played by such articular components, influences decidedly the therapeutical treatment aimed to the resolution of the Temporo-Mandibular joint pathology.

40|$|The Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) {{beamformer}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} accepted techniques used to estimate the solution of the inverse problem in <b>functional</b> brain <b>dynamics</b> studies, using magnetoencephalograms (MEG). However, since it is based on the assumption of uncorrelated brain sources, its performance decreases in the presence of correlated brain activity, compromising the accuracy of estimates of brain interactions. This problem has not stopped the use of the beamformer in techniques such as Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS), which estimates the <b>functional</b> brain <b>dynamics</b> in a more direct way than the LCMV, and with less computational cost. In this work it is proposed to use a modified version of the well known Minimum Norm Estimates (MNE) spatial filter to estimate the <b>functional</b> brain <b>dynamics</b> of highly correlated activity. This is achieved by using the filter to estimate the cross-spectral density matrices for the brain activity in the same way that DICS does with the LCMV beamformer. The MNE spatial filter is used as a basis because it is not affected by the presence of correlated brain activity. The results obtained from simulations shown that it is possible to estimate highly correlated brain interactions using the proposed method. However, additional methods and constraints need to be applied because of the distorted and weighted output characteristic of the MNE spatial filter. Methods such as the FOcal Undetermined System Solution (FOCUSS) and Singular Value Decomposition Truncation (SVDT) are used to reduce the distorted output, while the estimation of brain dynamics is limited to cortical surface interactions to avoid weighted solutions...|$|R

40|$|Networks of {{biochemical}} reactions {{regulated by}} positive-and negative-feedback processes underlie <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> in single cells. Synchronization of dynamics in the constituent cells is {{a hallmark of}} collective behavior in multi-cellular biological systems. Stability of the synchronized state is required for robust functioning of the multi-cell system {{in the face of}} noise and perturbation. Yet, the ability to respond to signals and change <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> are also important features during development, disease, and evolution in living systems. In this paper, using a coupled multi-cell system model, we investigate the role of system size, coupling strength and its topology on the synchronization of the collective dynamics and its stability. Even though different coupling topologies lead to synchronization of collective dynamics, diffusive coupling through the end product of the pathway does not confer stability to the synchronized state. The results are discussed with a view to their prevalence in biological systems. Copyright (C) EPLA, 201...|$|E
40|$|Is {{microcircuit}} wiring designed deterministically or probabilistically? Does geometric architecture predict <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> {{of a given}} neuronal microcircuit? These {{questions were}} addressed in the visceral sensory microcircuit of the caudal nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), which is generally thought to be homogeneous rather than laminar in cytoarchitecture. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry and whole-cell patch clamp recordings followed by neuronal reconstruction with biocytin filling, anatomical and functional organization of NTS microcircuitry was quantified to determine associative relationships. Morphologic and chemical features of NTS neurons displayed different patterns of process arborization and sub-nuclear localization according to neuronal types: smaller cells featured presynaptic local axons and GABAergic cells were aggregated specifically within the ventral NTS. The results suggested both a laminar organization and a spatial heterogeneity of NTS microcircuit connectivity. Geometric analysis of pre- and postsynaptic axodendritic arbor overlap of reconstructed neurons (according to parent somal distance) confirmed a heterogeneity of microcircuit connectivity that could underlie differential <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> along the dorsoventral axis. <b>Functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> in terms of spontaneous and evoked postsynaptic current patterns behaved in a strongly location-specific manner according to the geometric dimension, suggesting a spatial laminar segregation of neuronal populations: a dorsal group of high excitation and a ventral group of balanced excitation and inhibition. Recurrent polysynaptic activity was also noted in a subpopulation of the ventral group. Such geometric and functional laminar organization seems to provide the NTS microcircuit with both reverberation capability and a differentiated projection system for appropriate computation of visceral sensory information...|$|E

40|$|CONSPECTUS: Protein {{function}} is {{inextricably linked to}} protein dynamics. As we move from a static structural picture to a dynamic ensemble view of protein structure and function, novel computational paradigms are required for observing and understanding conformational dynamics of proteins and its functional implications. In principle, molecular dynamics simulations can provide the time evolution of atomistic models of proteins, but the long time scales associated with <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> {{make it difficult to}} observe rare dynamical transitions. The issue of extracting essential functional components of protein dynamics from noisy simulation data presents another set of challenges in obtaining an unbiased understanding of protein motions. Therefore, a methodology that provides a statistical framework for efficient sampling and a human-readable view of the key aspects of <b>functional</b> <b>dynamics</b> from data analysis is required. The Markov state model (MSM), which has recently become popular worldwide for studying protein dynamics, is an example of such a framework.
