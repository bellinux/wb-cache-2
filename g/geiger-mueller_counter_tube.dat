A <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter</b> used for measuring gaseous radioactivity has < 100 % counting efficiency owing to two factors: (1) ''end effect, '' due to decreased and distorted fields at the ends where wire-insulator joints are placed, and (2) ''wall effect, '' due to non-ionization by beta particles emitted near to and heading into the wall. The end effect was evaluated by making one end of the counter movable and measuring counting rates at a number of endplate positions. Much of the wall effect was calculated theoretically, based on known data for primary ionization of electrons as a function of energy and gas composition. Corrections were then made for the ''shakeoff'' effect in beta decay and for backscattering of electrons from the counter wall.

The pulse-height distribution curve of the existing preamplifier used in the neutron monitor system at the Centre for Space Research at the North-West University {{was found to be}} incorrect, and therefore the pulse-height information cannot be used for further research on the <b>counter</b> <b>tube</b> characteristics. A correct pulse-height distribution implies that the envelope of the pulse, as generated by an amplifier, has a very specific shape {{as a result of the}} physics that governs the generation of pulses in the neutron <b>counter</b> <b>tube.</b> It was therefore proposed that a new charge-sensitive preamplifier be synthesized to provide an output that provides the correct pulse-height distribution graph for a neutron monitor system. The Centre for Space Research at the North-West University is in the process of designing and building a new mini neutron monitor system. The new charge-sensitive preamplifier will be implemented into this updated system. Ultimately, the electronic subsystem must be able to provide a pulse-height distribution graph at the push of a button, thus making the preamplifier a key component in the new design.

40|$|GM {{counters}} {{are often}} used in radiation detection since they generate a strong signal which can be easily detected. The working principal of a GM counter {{is based on the}} interaction of ionizing radiation with the atoms and molecules of the gas present in the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> Free electrons created {{as a result of this}} interaction become initial electrons, i. e. start an avalanche process which is detected as a pulse of current. This current pulse is independent of the energy imparted on the gas, that being the main difference between a GM counter and the majority of other radiation detectors. In literature, the dependence on the incidence of radiation energy, tube's orientation and characteristics of the reading system are quoted as the main sources of measurement uncertainty of GM counters. The aim of this paper is to determine the dependence of measurement uncertainty of a GM counter on the volume of its <b>counter's</b> <b>tube.</b> The dependence of the pulse current on the size of the <b>counter's</b> <b>tube</b> has, therefore, been considered here, both in radial and parallel geometry.

Materials and Methods: The radiation levels were measured at six locations of six radiology departments, including behind the patient observation window, staff rest room, office, patient waiting room, behind the door of the X-ray room, and outdoor. These measurements were carried out while the X-ray equipment was in on and off status, using the halogen-quenched <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter.</b> Results: According to the results, the range of radiation levels inside the radiology departments at X-ray units with on/off status were 0. 36 ± 0. 12 to 0. 09 ± 0. 02 µSv/h and 0. 13 ± 0. 02 to 0. 09 ± 0. 03 µSv/h, respectively.
