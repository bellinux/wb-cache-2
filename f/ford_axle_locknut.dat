50|$|Atlas (not to be {{confused}} with several other companies who used the same name) was a Greek company based in Rentis that produced three-wheel trucks and other metal structures. In business between 1967 and 1972, it used (often rebuilt) Volkswagen engines, as well as German <b>Ford</b> <b>axles.</b> Cabs were made of glass-fiber reinforced composite. Two different models were produced.|$|R
50|$|The final car, the XII made in 1938, used a Lincoln-Zephyr V12 {{engine of}} 4,387 cc and Brough's own design of chassis with Girling brakes and <b>Ford</b> <b>axles.</b> Only one {{was made with}} a saloon body built by Charlesworth. A large car with an overall length of 219 in and width of 71 in, it still survives.|$|R
50|$|The Ford 8.8 is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} <b>Ford</b> Motor Company at the Sterling Axle Plant in Sterling Heights, MI. It {{was first used}} in model year 1983 <b>Ford</b> trucks. The <b>axle</b> was developed to replace the <b>Ford</b> 9-inch <b>axle.</b> This axle is still in production today {{for a variety of}} Ford vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The 1978-1979 Bronco is {{fitted with}} a coil-sprung Dana 44 front axle and has a leaf-sprung <b>Ford</b> 9-inch <b>axle</b> in the rear.|$|R
5000|$|The Volvo engine has , {{enough for}} a 116 mph top speed and a 0-60 mph time of 8.2 seconds. Some sources claim [...] SAE. Successful in competition, the rather {{expensive}} 1800 sold very slowly, and after the first 33 cars the de Dion rear suspension {{was replaced by a}} live <b>Ford</b> <b>axle.</b> The price was dropped from ₤1500 to ₤1340, but it was not enough to make the car profitable. Cars were stockpiling in 1966, and after 106 (or 99) had been built, the 1800 was replaced by the Ford-engined 1500.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "LP2 Carrier (Aust)". Australian-built {{variant of the}} Universal Carrier. Also {{produced}} in New Zealand. Used 1938-1939 Ford commercial axles; the 2A had 1940 <b>Ford</b> truck <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{he began}} {{climbing}} in 1945, {{he found that}} traditional pitons used for climbing in the Alps were too soft to be driven into narrow cracks without buckling. In his San Mateo business, Peninsula Wrought Iron Works, Salathé used high-carbon chrome-vanadium steel, {{similar to that used}} to make <b>Ford</b> <b>axles,</b> to forge extremely strong pitons which could be hammered into the hard Yosemite granite without buckling, as well as removed without getting mangled, thus rendering them reusable. These thin pitons became known as Lost Arrows, and are still manufactured under that name by Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd.|$|R
5000|$|In front, the 1980-1986 Bronco is {{fitted with}} a Dana 44 front <b>axle</b> with <b>Ford</b> TTB (Twin Traction Beam) {{independent}} front suspension. [...] As with the 1978-1979 Bronco, the rear axle is a leaf-sprung <b>Ford</b> 9-inch <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1964 {{disc brakes}} {{replaced}} drums on the front <b>axle.</b> (<b>Ford’s</b> larger sister model, the Ford Taunus P3, had received this same upgrade the previous year.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Buckle Sports Coupe is a fibreglass-bodied {{sports car}} which was {{produced}} in Australia by Buckle Motors from 1957 to 1959 [...] The 2-door coupe used a combination of Ford Zephyr Six and Ford Zephyr Mark II components, including a straight-6 engine from the Mark II. Totaling a weight of 865 kg and {{a top speed of}} 160 km/h, it also featured a box chassis frame, transverse leaf spring front suspension and a conventional <b>Ford</b> rear <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Frank Nichols's {{intention}} was to build a low-cost sports/racing car, {{and a series of}} models were produced between 1954 and 1959. The original model, based on the CSM car built nearby in Hastings by Mike Chapman, used Standard Ten front suspension rather than <b>Ford</b> swing <b>axles,</b> and a <b>Ford</b> Anglia rear <b>axle</b> with an overhead-valve-conversion of a Ford 10 engine. About 25 were made. While awaiting delivery of the CSM, Nichols finished second in a handicap race at Goodwood on 27 March 1954, driving a Lotus. [...] "From racing a Ford-engined CSM sports car in 1954, just for fun but nevertheless with great success, Frank Nichols has become a component manufacturer. The intermediate stage was concerned with the design of a special head, tried in the CSM and the introduction of the Elva car which was raced with success in 1955." [...] The cylinder head for the 1,172 cc Ford engine, devised by Malcolm Witts and Harry Weslake, featured overhead inlet valves.|$|R
50|$|The first Piper GT road {{model to}} a design by Tony Hilder, was {{introduced}} at the January 1967 Racing Car Show and immediately afterwards entered production as a body/chassis unit for home completion. The front engine rear drive tubular steel chassis using Triumph Herald front suspension and <b>Ford</b> rear <b>axle</b> components could accommodate {{a variety of}} engines. Problems with the first few produced caused further production to be delayed until the following year when a substantially better developed version was introduced and {{became known as the}} GTT.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{versions}} are driver's side differential drop, reverse-cut gears, and kingpin knuckles up to 1991. The later axles have ball joints. <b>Ford</b> Dana 60 <b>axles</b> mostly feature 35 spline inner axle shafts, {{but some are}} 30 spline. Larger brakes and 35 spline outer shafts were made standard in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|A {{beam axle}} {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used type of front suspension, due to its appearance when exposed without fenders on a vehicle with open front suspension. Independent front suspension is rarely used and most rat rods use a 1928-1948 <b>Ford</b> I-beam <b>axle,</b> with a transverse leaf spring. Although any rear axle {{can be used in a}} rat rod, the Ford rear end has been preferred for years due to the availability of spare parts. [...] "...Ford 9-inchers are the most used rear ends in nearly every form of racing and most high-performance street vehicles..." ...|$|R
50|$|The Linamar (formerly <b>Ford,</b> then Visteon) <b>axle</b> and {{transmission}} components factory {{is located at}} Crymlyn Burrows {{in the south of}} the ward. A distribution centre for Amazon.co.uk is located in the area beside the Visteon factory. The 18 hole Swansea Bay Golf Course is located to the east of the ward.|$|R
50|$|The Ford 9 inch {{rear axle}} {{is known as}} one of the most popular axles in {{automotive}} history. Ford ended its production in 1986 when it was replaced by the <b>Ford</b> 8.8 inch <b>axle.</b> However, aftermarket companies still produce this <b>axle.</b> The <b>Ford</b> 9 inch is a semi-floating, drop-out axle. It had a GAWR up to 3600 lbs.|$|R
5000|$|The Sterling 10.5 axle is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} <b>Ford</b> Motor Company at the Sterling Axle Plant in Sterling Heights, MI. It {{was first used}} in model year 1985 <b>Ford</b> trucks. The <b>axle</b> was developed to replace the Dana 60 and Dana 70. The Sterling 10.5 axle is currently only made as a full floating axle.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Big Three all started using this axle. GM began phasing {{it out in}} 1988 in favor of Independent suspension, while still {{offering}} it in some higher GVWR trucks (V-30) until 1991. Dodge used a Dana 60 up to 2002. 3rd Generation Dodge Rams dropped the Dana 60 in favor of AAM <b>axles.</b> <b>Ford</b> still uses the Dana 60 front axle. Manufactured in both Kingpin and Ball joint variations, [...] "standard" [...] (low pinion) and [...] "reverse cut" [...] rotation (high pinion) variations and open and limited slip, and locking variations. The housing material is Gray iron in early axles and Ductile iron in later <b>axles.</b> GM and <b>Ford</b> Dana 60 <b>axles</b> utilize locking hubs. Dodge Dana 60 axles utilized locking hubs until 1994 when a Center Axle Disconnect (CAD) system was adopted. However, model year 2002 Rams phased out the CAD system leaving some 2002 Dana 60 axles permanently locked in.|$|R
50|$|The RS500 {{was highly}} {{successful}} in Australian touring car racing with Dick Johnson Racing dominating the 1988 and 1989 Australian Touring Car Championships, with team boss Dick Johnson {{and his team}} mate John Bowe finishing one-two in both years (Sierra's would take the top three in the championship in both years). Early in 1988, the Johnson team also took the step of homologating a modified <b>Ford</b> nine-inch <b>axle</b> for the Sierra, eliminating one of the cars biggest weaknesses (its weak drivetrain) and allowing the cars to be driven harder with less fear of failure. This was also seen as essential in Australia which used standing starts compared to the rolling starts used in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Ala Kart began {{life as a}} '29 Ford Model A pickup. The chassis {{work was}} done by long-time friends Peters and [...] "Blackie" [...] Gejeian at their Fresno, California shop, with the body and styling by Barris (at Barris Kustoms in Los Angeles). The frame had a new centrally-located crossmember, and was {{completely}} chromed. The front end was also chromed, including a 4 in dropped axle, coil springs (not the factory leaf springs), split wishbones, Panhard rod, and tube shocks. 1940 Ford drum brakes were used. In back, a 1932 <b>Ford</b> rear <b>axle</b> was fitted, along with specially-fabricated coil springs, Panhard rod, all chromed, and Ford drum brakes. All four corners were equipped with Cadillic airbag suspension pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{built his}} first Devin-bodied special in 1958 for the Pikes Peak hill climb. Built {{to run in}} the sports car class that had been {{announced}} the previous year, the car was named the Hot Rod Magazine Special in honor of its sponsor. Miller fabricated a custom steel tube frame that used a coil-spring front suspension from a 1956 Chevrolet and a <b>Ford</b> rear <b>axle</b> with a Halibrand quick-change differential. Springing was by torsion bars. The engine was a small-block Chevrolet that had been bored and stroked to [...] and equipped with Hilborn injection. The 4-speed manual transmission was from a Corvette. The finished car weighed 1800 lb. Miller's Devin-Chevy won its class at Pikes Peak that year.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{mechanical}} features {{included a}} 1956 Chevrolet rear end, dropped <b>Ford</b> front <b>axle</b> beam, Buick brake drums and early Ford brakes. The frame was handmade of rectangular 2x4 inch steel tubing. The engine was a leftover {{from one of}} Roth's 1955 Chevrolets, having been removed {{to make way for}} a then-new Mark IV big-block given to him by General Motors. It was one of the very few completed cars Roth deemed to be a [...] "mistake" [...] because he felt the car did not show well since the heavily chromed engine and most of the chassis were hidden. The Orbitron was, in fact, one of his few customs to have a hood. Reportedly, the hydraulically operated hood did not fit well due to rushed fiberglass work.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford E93A engines were mildly tuned {{and many}} used twin SU's on a cast alloy 'Dellow' manifold. However, {{as an option}} the factory also offered the car with a Wade-Ventor (Roots type) {{supercharger}} installation. The MkII saw {{the introduction of a}} new and much more robust rear chassis section with coil springs, separate telescopic shock absorbers and a Panhard rod. This stiffer chassis allowed doors to become an optional fitting. The Mk V version was derived from the [...] "Lightweight" [...] Dellow (WRF 81) constructed by Tony Marsh for speed events in 1954. It saw coil springs introduced at the front (over telescopic dampers) although still with a one-piece <b>Ford</b> beam <b>axle.</b> About 300 Dellows in total are believed to have been constructed.|$|R
5000|$|This {{generation}} {{was the first}} time Ford used Independent suspension on their full size 4x4 trucks, as well as being the first time any of the Big Three (automobile manufacturers) made a 4x4 full size truck without a solid front <b>axle.</b> <b>Ford</b> and Dana Holding Corporation called this the Twin Traction Beam or TTB and used many of Dana Spicer parts. The F-150 used a light duty Dana 44 TTB. From 1979-1984, the rear axle was typically a <b>Ford</b> 9-inch <b>axle,</b> with the <b>Ford</b> 8.8 <b>axle</b> being phased gradually until the 9" [...] was finally phased out before the 1987 model year. The F-250 used an 8 lug version of the Dana 44 TTB called the Dana 44 TTBHD with the Dana 50 TTB being an option. The rear was a Dana 60 until mid 1985 when Ford phased out that axle for their own Sterling 10.25. Dana 60s could be either full float or semi float and came with a range of gear ratios. Semi float Dana 60s were either c-clip style, which utilize c-clips to hold the axle shafts in, or pressed in bearings which held the axles in with a special wheel bearing that bolted to the outer axle housing inside the brake drum. These were typically used in lighter duty trucks. Up until then, early 1985 models were built with left over 1984 materials, making some parts tough to find. The F-350 used the Dana 50 TTB in front until a mid-year change in 1985, when the F-350 was fitted with the Dana 60 solid front axle. F-250s could be ordered with a Dana 50 TTB if it was a heavier duty model; all other F-250's were equipped with a Dana 44 TTB. These trucks were leaf sprung and used a single gas shock with no coil springs and radius arms like on the F-150. For the rear axle the F-350 trucks used a Dana 60 for the single rear wheel trucks and a Dana 70 for the dual rear wheel trucks until 1985 when Ford once again phased in their own Sterling axle. Factory lifts used 2" [...] blocks on the rear suspension, or 2" [...] front and 4" [...] rear on HD trucks, usually on F250s and higher trims. Heavier duty F150s could be ordered with 2" [...] blocks.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} types of car customization, lots of {{different}} modifications are practiced in different combinations. One popular method of conversion involves removing all body molding, bumpers and fenders, then installing a classic <b>Ford</b> front <b>axle</b> to move the wheels forward and give the car a low, stretched look. Another popular customization is to move the stock Volkswagen axle beam forward or reverse the trailing/torsion arms and re-work the steering linkages. A Volksrod might be finished off with a chopped top and original VW wheels. Paint jobs may be flat black, or more elaborate, including with pinstriping. While Volksrods may be very elaborate, like any hot rod, many are built with few or no expensive chrome-plated or machined aluminum parts, but handmade by a [...] "cut, weld and drive" [...] owner, with simple mechanical tools, welding equipment and basic parts.|$|R
50|$|The G4 {{used the}} new Ford 105E engine {{and had a}} glass fibre GT style body and the {{suspension}} was updated to coil springing at the front with <b>Ford</b> live <b>axle</b> at the rear. Whereas the G2 and G3 had been designed for competition the G4 was usable as an everyday car but still was very competitive in motor sport with numerous successes. Over 500 were made up to 1969 {{with a variety of}} Ford engines. In 1963 a coupé was introduced alongside the open car and a BMC <b>axle</b> replaced the <b>Ford</b> one at the rear. On test the car reached 120 mi/h km/h with a 1500 cc engine. The series III version of 1966 added pop-up headlights. Production stopped in 1968 but was revived in 1981 with the Series IV which was two inches wider and three inches (76 mm) longer than the III.|$|R
50|$|Dellow styling {{was created}} by Lionel Evans at his Radpanels coachbuilding {{business}} in Kidderminster. The car evolved through several variants known as Mk I to Mk V. Early cars had the <b>Ford</b> beam front <b>axle</b> with transverse spring and short Panhard rod, quarter elliptics at the rear and Andre Hartford friction dampers all round. The Ford torque-tube was suitably shortened {{and the vast majority}} of cars used the 3-speed Ford gearbox but a very small number of cars (KOX 300 being one of them) were produced to customer order with a 4 speed gearbox, from the 10M series Morris.|$|R
25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. <b>Ford</b> twisted many <b>axles</b> through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|R
50|$|A new {{lineup of}} {{improved}} efficiency engines were offered beginning for 1997. A 4.2 L OHV V6, based on Ford's 3.8 L Essex V6, replaced the 4.9 L OHV I6, while 4.6 and 5.4 liter SOHC V8s replaced the 5.0 and 5.8 liter OHV V8s. The 4.6 and 5.4 liter V8s were marketed {{under the name}} Triton and mark the first use of Ford's Modular Single Overhead Cam (SOHC) engines in the F-series pickups. Ford's own 8.8 IFS replaced the Dana 44 front end, while the Ford 8.8 rear remained. The <b>Ford</b> Sterling 9.75 <b>axle</b> was also optioned in heavy-duty versions. In 2000, the Sterling 10.25 axle became an option.|$|R

5000|$|The Ford Explorer was {{introduced}} in March 1990 for the 1991 model year. First generation Explorers were equipped with the then new [...] 4.0 L Cologne V-6, manufactured in Cologne, Germany. Vehicles came with either Ford's own 4-speed A4LD automatic transmission, built in France, or Mazda's 5-speed M5OD manual transmission. Like the Bronco II it replaced, it was an SUV derivative of the Ranger pickup, thus Explorers came equipped {{with many of the}} Ranger's optional features. Like its direct competitor, the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, Explorers were available in both 2-door and 4-door body styles and being equipped with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The four-wheel drive versions were equipped with a Borg Warner 13-54 part-time four-wheel drive transfer case. The 13-54 was available with either [...] "Touch Drive" [...] electronic push-button shifting or manual lever-operated shifting. Both were [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] designs that allowed the SUVs to be shifted from two-wheel drive to [...] "four-high" [...] at any speed and into [...] "four-low" [...] when the vehicle was stopped. All Explorers were equipped with the <b>Ford</b> 8.8 <b>axle</b> in either a limited slip differencial, or open version with a variety of available gear ratios. Four-wheel-drive front axles were the TTB ("Twin Traction Beam") Dana 35 with some Dana 44-spec components.|$|R

50|$|A modern BriSCA F1 {{configuration}} is front-engined, rear-wheel drive, and open-wheeled, {{with the}} driver located centrally. The cars are constructed on race engineered steel ladder chassis with robust roll-over-safety cages and aluminium sheet body panelling, There is no limit in engine capacity or number of cylinders but engines must be naturally aspirated (no fuel injection, no supercharging or turbo charging permitted) and the engine blocks must be cast iron. The most common engines used, due to their reliability and availability, {{are based on the}} American Chevrolet V8 engine in both small block (350 ci) 5.7 litre and big block (454 ci) 7.4 litre varieties, producing upwards of 740 bhp with approx 640 ft/lbs of torque but some cars are known to have been equipped with engines of 9 litre capacity (540 ci).

50|$|Launched in 1991 {{and sold}} to Fisher Sportscars in 1994. Currently owned by Fury Sportscars who {{recently}} purchased the rights from BGH Geartech., based in Kent UK.The Fury has been very successful in competition with cars currently racing in many championships, including the 750 Motor Club's RGB (Road-Going Bike-Engined Kitcar) and Kitcar series. Many different engines can be fitted to the Fury, including all manner of car engines from the Ford Crossflow to Rover V8 and Cosworth Turbo. Motorbike engines have also been fitted and are popular for track cars due to the low weight, high power and built-in sequential gearbox for relatively little morey.There are {{two versions of the}} Fury rear suspension, the Live Axle version uses the <b>Ford</b> Escort rear <b>axle</b> located using two trailing links in conjunction with a Panhard rod. Coil over shock absorbers are used to give good ride comfort combined with excellent handling and grip. The Independent Rear Suspension version uses the Ford Sierra rear hub assembly in conjunction with purpose built hub carriers forming the uprights between upper and lower wishbones.

The FX4 off-road package did differ from the FX4 Level II package after 2002. The 2002 FX4 off-road and 2003 FX4 Level II are often referred to be the [...] "Holy Grail" [...] of Rangers, since there were limited production of these trucks with both a manual transmission and manual 4x4. According to Ford, 17,971 Level IIs were built from 2002 through 2007 (including the 2002), and 45,172 of the Off Roads were built from 2003-2009. The FX4 Off Road was available into 2009, but the Level II was stopped after 2007, though many Level II features could be ordered individually. In 2010 the Ranger discontinued the FX4 trim level for the U.S. market, but it remained available in the Canadian market.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of drag racing, post-World War II Central and Western United States {{military}} aircraft pilot training fields had become available for alternate uses, including auto racing. Don Garlits first drag race car was built under an oak tree at his home in North Tampa in 1954. An electric welder and a gas torch modified an old 1927 Ford Model “T” Roadster to accept a 1948 Mercury block, a 1939 Ford floor shift transmission, and a 1948 <b>Ford</b> differential and <b>axle.</b> That early T-Bucket's quarter mile performance was a 13.5 second elapsed time, at a top speed of 93 mph. It was this successful, formative roadster that would give Don the beginnings of his first rail-job dragster. He took off the body, moved the engine back and located the seat behind the drive axle, a design invented that same year by Mickey Thompson. This would be the 12.1 second, 108 mph slingshot dragster with which Big Daddy would win the first NHRA race he entered, when the NHRA Safety Safari came to Lake City, Florida. Three years later, he became a professional drag racer. The first national drag racing meet, sponsored by the National Hot Rod Association was held on an airfield near Great Bend, KS in 1955. Don Garlits, being from Florida, was something of an outsider. He was sometimes referred to as the Floridian, before permanently adopting the nickname, [...] "Swamp Rat," [...] which also became the name for each generation of his innovative dragster designs.|$|R
