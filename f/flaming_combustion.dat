50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between smouldering and <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> is that smouldering occurs {{on the surface of}} the solid rather than in the gas phase. Smouldering is a surface phenomenon but can propagate to the interior of a porous fuel if it is permeable to flow. The characteristic temperature and heat released during smouldering are low compared to those in the <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> (i.e., ~600 C vs. ~1500 C). Smouldering propagates in a creeping fashion, around , which is about ten times slower than flames spread over a solid. In spite of its weak combustion characteristics, smouldering is a significant fire hazard. Smouldering emits toxic gases (e.g., carbon monoxide) at a higher yield than flaming fires and leaves behind a significant amount of solid residue. The emitted gases are flammable and could later be ignited in the gas phase, triggering the transition to <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{wildfire}} {{front is}} the portion sustaining continuous <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion,</b> where unburned material meets active flames, or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material. As the front approaches, the fire heats both {{the surrounding air}} and woody material through convection and thermal radiation. First, wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 C. Next, the pyrolysis of wood at 230 C releases flammable gases. Finally, wood can smoulder at 380 C or, when heated sufficiently, ignite at 590 C. Even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location, heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 C, which pre-heats and dries flammable materials, causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster. High-temperature and long-duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching: the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the responses of a prototype smoke detector and a commercially available photoelectric smoke detector to smoke particles generated from various combustion sources. The prototype smoke detector combines optical scattering measurements with ionization chamber measurements in order to reduce/eliminate nuisance alarms due {{to the presence of}} airborne dusts or diesel exhaust particles. The commercially available smoke detector is designed for use in harsh environments where airborne dust represents a major problem due to both nuisance alarms and detector contamination. In the experiments, the responses of the two detectors were measured when exposed to smoke particles from the exhaust of a diesel engine and from a variety of fire sources, including wood, coal, styrene butadiene rubber, and No. 2 diesel fuel.

However, during the combustion of polyurethane foams, the HCN yield is notably higher when the fire progresses from smouldering to <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion.</b> This was observed by Levin et al. (1985) when a flexible polyurethane foam was first heated at a temperature below its auto-ignition temperature, followed by <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> of the remaining char and residue at a higher temperature. The authors intended to compare the HCN yields for the non-flaming and <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> of the foam in a smoke chamber apparatus (as described in Levin et al. 1982) to that of a large scale test room. The test room was 2.4 [*]×[*] 3.0 [*]×[*] 3.0  m with a door (dimensions not specified) and a 1 to 2  kg slab of foam in the centre of the room. Smouldering was forced by an electrically heated resistance wire embedded in the sample and a load cell measured the mass of the sample throughout the experiment. In the smoke chamber, the highest reported yield during <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> was 1.02  mg g− 1. In the large scale test room, the sample smouldered for 1.5 to 2  h, resulting in a HCN yield of 1.03  mg g− 1. Once the material ignited, the yield of HCN increased to 3.8  mg g− 1. While the smoke chamber experiment is known to give low HCN yields, and both scenarios are well-ventilated, the yield of HCN was almost 4 times as high during <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> if the sample was allowed to smoulder first.|$|E

Temperature histories measurement and analysis gaseous were used to explore the transition’s mechanism. The results show that with the width increased, the surface area and the air flow rate which access to the inside of material have also increased, and the quantity of oxygen is sufficient, heat release quantity by carbon oxidation is increased. When the width reaches a certain value, polyurethane foam material transformed easier from smoldering to <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion.</b> The polyurethane foam transforms to the <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> not only depends on the length, width size but also relates to the thickness closely.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{performance}} of an innovative thermal insulation rigid board is evaluated in terms of fire behaviour and fungal resistance. The board is based on vegetal pith and a natural gum (corn pith and sodium alginate) and it is completely compostable. This new composite was developed in previous work. Here boric acid, aluminium hydroxide and ammonium polyphosphate are used as fire retardants and montan wax, acetic acid and lactic acid are used as water repellent and fungicides respectively. Interactions between these different treatments is investigated. Both <b>flaming</b> and smouldering <b>combustion</b> processes of the different formulations are evaluated by small-scale techniques which include pyrolysis microcalorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. A medium-scale device is also designed in order to study {{the impact of the}} different additives to the smouldering kinetics. Fire behaviour tests show that good improvement is obtained, both in <b>flaming</b> and smouldering <b>combustion</b> when boric acid is added. Although smouldering is not avoided in any case, the addition of 8 % of boric acid or aluminium hydroxide slows down the speed of combustion propagation. The effect of the different additives on the moisture content and mould growth at 97 % RH and 27 °C is analysed. Under such severe conditions none of the additives is able to prevent mould growth, with the exception of boric acid.

30|$|In {{testing of}} vegetation, {{there are several}} aspects that can be {{considered}} important, including plant age, size, physical arrangement, fire intensity, and time. Inconsistencies may occur in arranging the vegetation specimens in the calorimeter’s holder (White et al. 2002). Therefore, proper measures should be introduced in arranging the vegetation specimen to ensure consistency. Concerning the radiative heat flux levels used for testing the vegetation fuel, some studies have used a constant heat flux level (Liu et al. 2013) throughout the test and some have used a gradient of heat flux in a range (White et al. 2002, Fateh et al. 2016). One {{of the advantages of}} using low radiative heat flux is that it enhances the sensitivity of the test results to differences between the dry specimens of the various species.

The upward flammabil-ity test is conducted in the most severe <b>flaming</b> <b>combustion</b> environment expected in the spacecraft.

Thus, although reasonable from a flammability safety point of view, the test is likely to eliminate materials that may be safe for use on spacecraft. A different test logic is suggested to address these impediments: one to determine materials self-extingnishment limits.

30|$|Northern {{temperate}} zone (30 ° to 50 ° latitude) peatlands store a {{large proportion}} of the world’s terrestrial carbon (C) and are subject to high-intensity, stand-replacing wildfires characterized by <b>flaming</b> stage <b>combustion</b> of aboveground vegetation and long-duration smoldering stage combustion of organic soils. Coastal peatlands are a unique region in which long-duration wildfire soil combustion is responsible for the majority of total annual emissions from all wildfires in the North American coastal plain. We developed a new method and approach to estimate aboveground and belowground C emissions from a 2008 peatland wildfire by analyzing vegetation C losses from field surveys of biomass consumption from the fire and soil C losses derived from the Soil Survey Geographic Database, a digital elevation model derived from airborne optical remote-sensing technology and ground elevation surveys using a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver. The approach to estimate belowground C emissions employed pre-fire LI-DAR-derived elevation from ground return points coupled with post-fire survey-grade GPS elevation measurements from co-located ground return points. Aboveground C emission calculations were characterized for litter, shrub foliage and woody biomass, and tree foliage fractions in different vegetation classes, thereby providing detailed emissions sources. The estimate of wildland fire C emissions considered the contribution of hydrologic regime and land management to fire severity and peat burn depth. The peatland wildfire had a mean peat burn depth of 0.42 m and resulted in estimated belowground fire emissions of 9.16 Tg C and aboveground fire emissions of 0.31 Tg C, for total fire emissions of 9.47 Tg C (1 Tg = 1012 grams). The mean belowground C emissions were estimated at 544.43 t C ha− 1, and the mean aboveground C emissions were 18.33 t C ha− 1 (1 t = 106 grams).|$|R

These programs involved comparison of the response and alarm time of optical and ionization type smoke sensors to smoldering and <b>flaming</b> coal <b>combustion</b> in a smoke chamber. Coal combustion experiments conducted in the smoke chamber demonstrated that a CO concentration of 5 ppm above ambient corresponded to an optical density of 0. 022 m 1. For the four smoke sensors for which a continuous analog signal was available, a smoke sensor alarm {{was defined as the}} average background signal plus ten times the peak-to-peak noise. This alarm criterion resulted in the association of the alarm for three of the four sensors with a smoke optical density of 0. 022 m- 1. and 0. 033 m- 1 for the fourth smoke sensor. The smoke sensors used in the smoke chamber studies were incorporated into large scale diesel fuel fire experiments conducted under normal ventilation conditions in the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) at the Pittsburgh Research Center. These experiments showed that a diffusion mode smoke sensor alarmed earlier than a diffusion mode CO sensor; and, based upon the measurement of the optical transmission at the location of a pump mode ionization type smoke sensor that a pump mode ionization smoke sensor alarmed at an average smoke optical density of 0. 021 m" for the twelve experiments conducted. A series of 30 and 330 kW diesel fuel fire intensity experiments were conducted under zero airflow conditions in the SRCM. It was determined that :(I) thermal sensors are inadequate at 30 m from a 300 kW fire;(2) a diffusion mode ionization smoke sensor can be more effective for mine fire detection than a diffusion mode CO sensor;(3) recommendations can be made for sensor spacing in a mine entry based upon the measured CO buoyancy induced spread rates along the mine roof and the time for a developing coal fire to ignite a conveyor belt...|$|R

The absolute values of C 2 H 6, however, may be systematically low by about 30 % due to uncertainties of the spectroscopic data used.

The aerosols of interest lie in the size range of tens to a few hundred nanometers, {{out of range of}} the standard photometer calibration. To correct for these uncertainties, the photometer mass concentrations were compared to gravimetric samples to determine if consistent correlations existed. The response of a calibrated and modified combination ionization/photoelectric smoke detector was also used. In addition, the responses of this sensor and a similar, prototype ionization/photoelectric sensor, along with discrete angular scattering, total scattering, and total extinction measurements, were used to define in real time the size, morphology, and radiative transfer properties of these differing aerosols that are generally in the form of fractal aggregates. SEM/TEM images were also obtained in order to compare qualitatively the real-time, continuous experimental measurements with the visual microscopic measurements. These data clearly show that significant differences exist between aerosols from flaming and from smoldering combustion and that these differences produce very different scattering and absorption signatures. The data also indicate that ionization/photoelectric sensors can be utilized to measure continuously and in real time aerosol properties over a broad spectrum of applications related to adverse environmental and health effects.
