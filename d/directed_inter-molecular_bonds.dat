40|$|Among {{the human}} heme-peroxidase family, {{myeloperoxidase}} (MPO) {{has a unique}} disulfide-linked oligomeric structure resulting from multi-step processing of the pro-protein monomer (proMPO) after it exits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Related family members undergo some, but not all, of the processing steps involved with formation of mature MPO. Lactoperoxidase has its pro-domain proteolytically removed and is a monomer in its mature form. Eosinophil peroxidase undergoes proteolytic removal of its pro-domain followed by proteolytic separation into heavy and light chains and is a heterodimer. However, only MPO undergoes both these proteolytic modifications and then is further oligomerized into a heterotetramer by a single <b>inter-molecular</b> disulfide <b>bond.</b> The details of how and where the post-ER processing steps of MPO occur are incompletely understood. We report here that T 47 D breast cancer cells stably transfected with an MPO expression plasmid are able to efficiently replicate all of the processing steps that lead to formation of the mature MPO heterotetramer. MPO also traffics to the lysosome granules of T 47 D cells where it accumulates, allowing in-depth immunofluorescent microscopy studies of MPO trafficking and storage for the first time. Using this novel cell model we show that formation of MPO's single <b>inter-molecular</b> disulfide <b>bond</b> can occur normally {{in the absence of}} the proteolytic events that lead to separation of the MPO heavy and light chains. We further demonstrate that Cys 319, which forms MPO's unique <b>inter-molecular</b> disulfide <b>bond,</b> is important for events that precede this step. Mutation of this residue alters the glycosylation and catalytic activity of MPO and blocks its entry into the endocytic pathway where proteolytic processing and disulfide bonding occur.

50|$|The unique {{effects that}} stem from ion beam mixing are {{primarily}} {{a result of}} ballistic effects; that is, impinging ions have high kinetic energies that are transferred to target atoms on collision. Ion energies {{can be seen on}} the order of 1 keV to 200 keV. When accelerated, such ion energies are sufficiently high to break intra- and especially <b>inter-molecular</b> <b>bonds,</b> and initiate relocations within an atomic lattice. The sequence of collisions is known as a collision cascade.During this ballistic process, energies of impinging ions displace atoms and electrons of the target material several lattice sites away, resulting in relocations there and interface mixing at the boundary layer. (Note that energies must be sufficiently high in order for the lattice rearrangements to be permanent rather than manifesting as mere vibrational responses to the impinging radiation, i.e. the kinetic energies must be above the threshold displacement energy of the material.) If energies are kept sufficiently high in these nuclear collisions, then, compared to traditional high-dose implantation processes, ballistic ion implantation produces higher intrafilm alloy concentrations at lower doses of irradiation compared to conventional implantation processes.|$|R

However, the enlargement can occur without input, suggesting an uncertain relationship between cytoplasmic input and plant growth. Therefore, {{the role of the}} input was investigated by quantitatively comparing growth in isolated walls (no input) with that in living cells (input occurring). Cell walls were isolated from growing internodes of Chara corallina and filled with pressur-ized oil to control turgor pressure while elongation wasmonitored. Turgor pressure in living cells was simi-larly controlled and monitored by adding/removing cell solution. Temperature was varied in some experi-ments. At all pressures and temperatures, isolated walls displayed turgor-driven growth indistinguishable in every respect from that in living cells, except the rate decelerated in the isolated walls while the living cells grew rapidly. The growth in the isolated walls was highly responsive to temperature, in contrast to the elastic extension that {{has been shown to be}} insensitive to similar temperatures. Consequently, strong <b>inter-molecular</b> <b>bonds</b> were responsible for growth and weak bonds for elastic extension. Boiling the walls gave the same results, indicating that enzyme activities were not controlling these bonds. However, pectin added to isolated walls reversed their growth deceler-ation and returned the rate to that in the living cells. The pectin was similar to that normally produced by the cytoplasm and deposited in the wall, suggesting that continued cytoplasmic input of pectin may play a role in sustaining turgor-driven growth in Chara.
