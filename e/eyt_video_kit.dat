40|$|In this example, we {{show how}} you can use NISC [4] to read the values of {{switches}} and control the LCD of Xilinx Virtex- 4 <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> [1]. The <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> board has five buttons (called north, south, west, east) where next to each there is an LED (called led_north, led_south, led_west, led_east). Also, it has a two-line character LCD. In this simple application, a NISC component writes a string on the LCD as the user pushes the buttons. When user pushes south, east, center or west buttons the LCD shows strings “SOUTH”, “EAST”, “CENTER”, or “WEST ” strings, respectively. The north button resets the NISC to rerun the application. Figure 1 - Push-buttons and LCD on Xilinx <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> Board To implement this application, we can use any NISC with an output register (called exernalOutputReg) and an Interrupt Unit (IU).

40|$|In this example, we run an {{application}} on a NISC [3] {{and show the}} cycle count of the application on a 2 -line character LCD on Xilinx Virtex- 4 <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> board [1]. To drive the LCD, we use a second NISC (called DisplayNISC) {{in order to make}} the process transparent to the first NISC (called MainNSIC). The second NISC has an internal counter that is reset at the beginning of the program. The halt signal of MainNISC is connected to the interrupt port of the DisplayNISC. Once the MainNISC finishes the halt signal becomes 1 and raises an interrupt to the DisplayNISC. The DisplayNISC stops the counter and shows number of cycles on the LCD. Figure 1 - Push-buttons and character LCD on Xilinx <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> Board Figure 1 shows the LCD and push buttons of the <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> board. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the entire system. This system is captured in Generic Netlist Representation (GNR) format [1]. The counter is also captured in both GNR and Verilog. The DisplayNISC and MainNISC components are captured in GNR as well. We mapped MiBench benchmarks to the MainNISC and the LCD driver and counter driver to the DisplayNISC. Then, we compiled the code on the processors and generated the synthesizable code for the system using NISC Toolset.

40|$|In this example, we {{show how}} you can use NISC [4] to read the values of {{switches}} and control LEDs of Xilinx Virtex- 4 <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> [1]. The <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> board has five buttons (called north, south, west, east) where next to each there is an LED (called led_north, led_south, led_west, led_east). Also, there are four other LEDs on board (led 0, led 1, led 2, led 3). In this simple application, NISC counts from 0 to 16 in a loop and shows the binary numbers on the four LEDs. At any point during the execution, the user can press east, center, and west buttons to reset the counter to 0001, 0010, and 0100, respectively. The south button stops the count down and terminates the program. The north button resets the NISC to rerun the application. To allow the user to see the values on the LED, the counter must wait {{at least for a}} fraction of a second after each update. Figure 1 - Push-buttons and LEDs on Xilinx <b>Video</b> Starter <b>Kit</b> Board To implement this application, we can use any NISC with an output data register (called exernalOutputReg) and an Interrupt Unit (IU). The IU is needed for the part of the specification that requires resetting the counter to specific values as user pushes the buttons. We connect the on-board switches to the interrupt lines of a NISC component and its external output to the LEDs on board. In FPGAs, this is done through defining constraint files.
