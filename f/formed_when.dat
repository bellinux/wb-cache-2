5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> it is trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As {{with the other}} carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E

Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E
5|$|M-91 was <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, {{the highway}} {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 was even a discontinuous highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred.|$|E
5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that {{all three of these}} isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.|$|E

5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.|$|E
5|$|The conical hill of {{clay and}} Blue Lias {{rises from the}} Somerset Levels. It was <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> {{surrounding}} softer deposits were eroded, leaving the hard cap of sandstone exposed. The slopes of the hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the Iron Age to Roman eras.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E

5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Bivalve fossils are <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in {{the sediment}}.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> {{water vapor}} from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region <b>formed</b> <b>when</b> the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.|$|E
