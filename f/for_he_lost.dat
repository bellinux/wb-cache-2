He was seeking or expecting some one, for he stopped frequently and waited or listened. He had not walked far, for he wore spurs that tinkled and caught in the brush; and yet he had not ridden here, for no horse's hoofs passed the road since we have been here. He must have come from Indian Spring." ...|$|E
60|$|The Black Prince did {{not live}} to succeed his father and inherit the throne, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> his health in his campaigns on the Continent, and came home to England, and died {{a few years before}} his father died. His son, whose name was Richard, was his heir, and when at length old King Edward died, this young Richard succeeded to the crown, under the title of King Richard II. In the history of Richard II., in this series, a full account of the life of his father, the Black Prince, is given, and of the various {{remarkable}} adventures that he met with in his Continental campaigns.|$|E

6000|$|... "After {{that our}} wealth flowed in without let or hindrance. Furs we had without number, and the fancy-work of the women, {{all of the}} chief's tea, and no end of meat. One day Moosu retold for my benefit, and sadly mangled, the story of Joseph in Egypt, but from it I got an idea, and soon I had half the tribe at work {{building}} me great meat caches. And of all they hunted I got the lion's share and stored it away. Nor was Moosu idle. He made himself a pack of cards from birch bark, and taught Neewak the way to play seven-up. He also inveigled the father of Tukeliketa into the game. And one day he married the maiden, {{and the next day}} he moved into the shaman's house, which was the finest in the village. The fall of Neewak was complete, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> all his possessions, his walrus- hide drums, his incantation tools--everything. And in the end he became a hewer of wood and drawer of water at the beck and call of Moosu. And Moosu--he set himself up as shaman, or high priest, and out of his garbled Scripture created new gods and made incantation before strange altars.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Navarre {{lost all}} {{importance}} under King Sancho IV, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> Rioja to Sancho II of Castile, and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering Wasqat Huesca {{deep in the}} valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25 km from Saraqustat Zaragoza.|$|E
5000|$|Under Chilperic I {{and then}} the usurper Gundoald, a dux named Bladast was acting as duke over the region of Aquitaine. The dux Austrovald was sent in 587 to pacify the Basques of Vasconia, a {{difficult}} enterprise {{in which he was}} none too successful, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> many men to captivity and the Basques are found as far as the Garonne by 602. Bordeaux probably formed the chief fortified frontier city of Austrovald's watch. It is probable that the Basques were forced to pay tribute, but left under their own laws. It is out of this that a separate Gascon duchy was created in 602, probably within Aquitaine.|$|E
50|$|In 1208 Laskaris renewed his {{offensive}} against David Komnenos at Sangarios River and investing Heraclea Pontica. David responded {{by sending a}} messenger to the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders, who begged for help and warned the monarch that if Henry did not help him, David would suffer a serious defeat. Leaving his marshal in Adrianople to finish rebuilding the city, Henry then croossed the Sea of Marmara and occupied Nicomedia, threatening Laskaris' rear, which forced the latter to lift his siege and return to his own territory. Theodore's withdraw was costly, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> about 1000 men in crossing the Sangarios, which was in flood. Henry's army might have seized more land in Bithynia, had not an abominably cold winter swept in preventing his troops from advancing any further.|$|E

50|$|In the end, {{after long}} resistance, the Sutherland men {{obtained}} the victory; {{few of these}} that came to renew the fight escaped, but only John Mackay himself, and that very hardly. Neil MacIan MacAngus of Assynt was there slain, with divers of his men. There were 216 of the Strathnaver men left dead in the field, besides those that died in the chase. There were slain of Sutherland men 38. Not long thereafter John Mackay sent William and Donald, two brethren, with a company of men, to invade John Murray, with whom they met {{at a place called}} Loch-Sallachie, in Sutherland. After a sharp skirmish, both the chieftains of the Strathnaver men were slain, with divers of their men, and the rest put to flight; neither was the victory pleasing to John Murray, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> there his brother, called John Roy-Murray.|$|E
50|$|Their adversary, Theodore Laskaris, had {{not been}} idle. He had {{neutralized}} rivals along his southern marches—Sabas Asidenos, Manuel Maurozomes, and Theodore Mangaphas; he had been crowned Emperor in March or April 1206; all the while Theodore had frustrated attempts of Henry of Flanders to expand the newly founded Latin Empire into Anatolia. In 1208 Theodore decided to strike against the Paphlagonian possessions of Alexios' brother David by crossing the Sangarios River and investing Heraclea Pontica. In response, David sent a deputation to Henry of Flanders, which reached the Latin Emperor in September 1208 with their request for help. Henry led his troops across the Sea of Marmara and occupied Nicomedia, threatening Laskaris' rear, and forcing the latter to lift his siege and return to his own territory. Theodore's withdraw was costly, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> about 1000 men in crossing the Sangarios, which was in flood.|$|E
50|$|In these {{journeys}} Giles {{was always}} {{at pains to}} procure by manual labor what food and shelter he needed. At Ancona he made reed baskets; at Brindisi he carried water and helped to bury the dead; at Rome he cut wood, trod the wine-press, and gathered nuts; while the guest of a cardinal at Rieti he insisted on sweeping the house and cleaning the knives. A keen observer of men and events, Giles acquired {{in the course of}} these travels much valuable knowledge and experience, which he turned to good account. <b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>lost</b> no occasion to preach to the people. His sermons, if such they can be called, were brief and heartfelt talks, replete with homely wisdom; he never minced his words, but spoke to all with apostolic freedom. After some years of activity Giles was assigned by St. Francis to the hermitage of Monteripido in the region of Perugia, where he began a life of contemplation and ecstasy which continued with very visible increase until his death.|$|E
