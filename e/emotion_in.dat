5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} in the Chicago area. Mendes, having {{recently}} finished 1999's acclaimed American Beauty, pursued a story that had minimal dialogue and conveyed <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> the imagery. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall took advantage of the environment to create symbolism for the film, for which he won several awards, including a posthumous Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father-son relationships.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} suitable methods for measuring future-oriented <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> a consumer context, where they have been shown to play an important role in decision-making. However the experience and knowledge of future-oriented <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> consumer research is limited and it is thus necessary to broaden the perspective to cover <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> general to gain insight into the possible methods. This paper examines the methods for measuring <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> a consumer context. Emotions have recently gained increasing attention but the measurement of emotions is complex and the experience is limited. However several methods have been applied over time and a review of these methods and the experiences gained can build a foundation for further research in the area of future-oriented <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> consumer decision-making. Three overall approaches to the measurement of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> consumer research are found: Self report, autonomic measures and brain imaging. Verbal Self Report and fMRI are assessed to be the most important methods. Self report is the most commonly used technique to measure <b>emotions</b> especially <b>in</b> consumer research and this is primarily verbal self report. However the method is found to have severe limitations. Brain imaging and especially fMRI has contributed significantly t...|$|R

5|$|The Renaissance was a {{cultural}} movement that profoundly affected European intellectual {{life in the}} early modern period. Beginning in Italy, and spreading {{to the rest of}} Europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in literature, philosophy, art, music, politics, science, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry. Renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> art.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to deepening and extending our understanding and knowledge of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters by studying it from the two most central human actors in service encounter: (i) the service firm’s employees and (ii) the customer of this firm. This dissertation consist of five separate papers that conceptualize and empirically investigate how different appraisals by employees and customers generate positive and negative emotions, and how types of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters are linked to patterns of behavioural responses. The methods used for gathering data involved interviews and questionnaire studies of various service firms.   This dissertation has sought to offer two main contributions. First, this thesis presents an extended understanding of employees’ <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounter and their effect on employees’ perceptions of service quality. One of the chief findings is that work-related conditions such as employees’ perception of their working role and managerial practices are related to {{both positive and negative}} <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters. Moreover, the findings indicate that there exists a spill-over effect between employees’ experiences of emotions and employees’ perceptions of the delivery of service quality in service encounters. Secondly, this thesis also contributes to furthering our understanding of the customer’s appraisal of service quality with respect to customers’ positive <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters as well as to deepening our understanding of negative emotions when customers experience a negative service encounter. Specifically, it was found that both human and non-human service-quality factors are able to trigger customer’s positive <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters. Positive emotions were strongly related to behavioural responses such as customer loyalty. When a customer experiences negative <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters as a result of negative experience, the findings point to three sources of these negative emotions: (i) ‘self’ (the customer’s own fault), (ii) ‘other’ (the fault of the company), and (iii) ‘situational’ (the fault is beyond the customer’s and company’s control). Another finding is that customers’ negative <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters tend diminish but only to some extent, even after the service firm has set into motion a process of service recovery. In summary, this thesis contributes to our understanding of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> service encounters and contributes to the ongoing debate and discussion in service research about the role of <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> this context. ...|$|R

5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertoire}} of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, {{political and military}} struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as kunqu. Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems {{have been used to}} sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either daxi (serious) or xiaoxi (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.|$|E
5|$|The team {{decided to}} stay with {{two-dimensional}} graphics instead of three-dimensional graphics, believing it would help differentiate themselves from other Square Enix titles as well as better represent their vision for the game. When first approached {{with the task of}} creating the art for the game, background art director Takayuki Ohdachi thought the modern-day setting would be too boring, and opted to use highly skewed and angular images of Shibuya to avoid this; the rest of the creative team found this approach to fit the game quite well. For combat, the background of the top screen was selected for visual interest, while the bottom touchscreen background was designed to emphasize the gameplay. Ohdachi was also responsible for the artwork for the psych pins, and used a mix of pop art and tribal designs for the various graphics. Character designs were handled by Tetsuya Nomura and Gen Kobayashi. Character designs were made to match with the real-world Tokyo setting, after which their outfits were designed based on the character's personality. Kobayashi was also in charge of designing the game's non-player characters and noted how most designs made it to the final product. Hasegawa was responsible for creating the designs for the Noise creatures, and wanted to have them recognizable as creatures before they decay into skeletons. In keeping with the theme of human <b>emotion</b> <b>in</b> the game, Hasegawa selected creatures that conveyed such feelings, such as wolves and crows. Representation of the Noise in the game required drawing the 2D sprites from several angles to match the action on screen as well as using rotoscoping on pre-rendered sprites, and took several iterations between Square Enix and Jupiter {{to make sure that the}} sprites' art matched the style of game, with Kando making the two-hour trip between Tokyo and Kyoto weekly to check on the progress.|$|E

50|$|Evidence for <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> animals {{has been}} {{primarily}} anecdotal, from individuals who interact with pets or captive animals {{on a regular}} basis. However, critics of animals having emotions often suggest that anthropomorphism is a motivating factor {{in the interpretation of}} the observed behaviours. Much of the debate is caused by the difficulty <b>in</b> defining <b>emotions</b> and the cognitive requirements thought necessary for animals to experience <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> a similar way to humans. The problem is made more problematic by the difficulties <b>in</b> testing for <b>emotions</b> <b>in</b> animals. What is known about human emotion is almost all related or in relation to human communication.|$|R
