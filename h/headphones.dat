5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on the Beats brand of <b>headphones,</b> which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of the <b>headphones.</b> Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed.|$|E

5|$|Praseodymium alloyed with nickel (PrNi5) {{has such}} a strong magnetocaloric effect that it has allowed {{scientists}} to approach within one thousandth of a degree of absolute zero.

40|$|DSPを用いて，能動騒音制御技術に基づき，音声や警報音などの必要な音は低減せずに，騒音のみを選択的に低減する騒音低減音響ヘッドフォンを製作した．能動騒音制御の適応アルゴリズムとしてFiltered-X-LMSアルゴリズムを用いた．実験の結果，周期的な騒音を低減し，必要な音声は低減されないことが確認された．また，アルゴリズムのパラメータを調整することで，十分な安定性と収束性が得られた．しかし，白色雑音は低減することができなかった．周期性を持たない騒音の低減については，今後の課題である．We made a {{prototype}} of adaptive active noise control <b>headphone</b> (DSP <b>headphone)</b> using the TMS 320 C 6711 DSK and the daughter board(THS 1206). The filtered-X LMS adaptive control algorithm is implemented on a TMS 320 C 6711 DSK that drives a Panasonic RP-HT 455 <b>headphone</b> (secondary loud speaker) and Audio-technica AT 9642 microphones (reference and error microphone). This <b>headphone</b> would be useful for reducing periodic undesired sounds. By adjusting the step size, stability and reasonably fast convergence rates were obtained. The amount of noise reduction for a single frequency (300 Hz) is 35 dB. Desired sounds (500 Hz), such as speech, are left to be heard clearly, but, in contrast, {{the reduction of the}} analog <b>headphone</b> (commercial <b>headphone)</b> is 15 dB and the desired sound is reduced...|$|R

5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 <b>headphones</b> as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E

5|$|During {{this era}} Gaga ventured into business, collaborating with {{consumer}} electronics company Monster Cable Products to create in-ear, jewel-encrusted, <b>headphones</b> called Heartbeats by Lady Gaga. Gaga also partnered with Polaroid in January 2010 as their Creative Director and announced {{a suite of}} photo capturing products called Grey Label.

5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, <b>headphones,</b> power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince the industry that audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 2017, Paul was {{assaulted}} by a neighbor, Rene Boucher (aged 59), a former anesthesiologist. As Paul was wearing noise-cancelling <b>headphones</b> while mowing his lawn, Boucher {{was able to}} surprise him. Boucher was arrested by state troopers and charged with one count of fourth degree assault and released on a $7,500 bond. Initial announcements stated that Paul suffered only minor injuries but subsequent news reports said he sustained five broken ribs and lacerations to his lungs. Some sources later stated that six ribs had been broken and that pleural effusion had set in. Three of the ribs were displaced fractures.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have a nominal composition of SmCo5 or Sm2Co17. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of neodymium magnets. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700°C (cf. 300–400°C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, <b>headphones,</b> and high-end magnetic pickups for guitars and related musical instruments. For example, they are used in the motors of a solar-powered electric aircraft, the Solar Challenger, and in the Samarium Cobalt Noiseless electric guitar and bass pickups.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing <b>headphones.</b> The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this {{undergraduate}} research project, {{we built}} a noise canceling <b>headphone</b> with a negative feedback system. We set up the microphone inside the ear cup of the <b>headphone.</b> The tradeoff in this design is the performance and {{the stability of the}} system. Our <b>headphone</b> can attenuate the noise for the frequency below 1 KHz and achieve at least 10 dB noise attenuation below 400 Hz. We calculated the theoretical frequency response and verified it with Matlab. The circuit was designed in Pspice and tested by generating the noise from another <b>headphone.</b> The system achieved the best performance under the stable condition. 1...|$|R
40|$|A <b>headphone</b> {{will cover}} a listener's outer ear and reduce his/her {{auditory}} situation {{awareness of the}} surrounding. Unlike <b>headphone,</b> bone vibrator can transmit sound without covering the outer ear. In order to study the benefits of replacing <b>headphone</b> with bone vibrator, factors affecting the subjective loudness comparison between a <b>headphone</b> and a bone vibrator {{will need to be}} investigated Three experiments have been conducted to study the effects of practice, static contact force, and the order of presentation on loudness comparison ratings between a 1 kHz tone transmitted via a <b>headphone</b> and a bone vibrator. Results showed that neither practice nor order of presentation affect the loudness comparison data significantly. As the static contact force between a bone vibrator and a mastoid increased from 0. 1 to 3. 6 N, the perceived loudness peaked at 0. 7 N and then decreased...|$|R
