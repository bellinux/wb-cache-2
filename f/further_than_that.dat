5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger calibre cannon during the World Wars has reversed since. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their ageing pieces. As {{it could be}} towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to , <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of the Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will fire 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets will give a Zumwalt-class destroyer the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are less expensive than a cruise missile but have a similar guidance capability.|$|E

25|$|The 45 caliber Canon de 164mm Modèle 1893 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obdurator {{to get a good}} gas seal during firing. It was replaced by the Mle 1893/96 gun which used a plastic seal for the obdurator, differed {{in the construction of the}} gun, had a slightly longer barrel of 46.6 calibers and the newer gun was able to fire a new HE shell <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> used by the older gun.|$|E

25|$|Reconstructions of {{tectonic plate}} {{movement}} in the past 250million years (the Cenozoic and Mesozoic eras) can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles.

Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna.

25|$|Oaks Park {{is a large}} park {{landscaped}} in {{a generally}} naturalistic style, providing downland walks. It is varied and includes formal horticulture, natural chalk meadows, woodlands and informal parkland. It was substantially laid out for the Earl of Derby nearly 250 years ago – in the 1770s – but its villa dates back <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> The villa (for one Thomas Gosling) was built around 1750, in the era's fashionable landscape style, with trees forming a perimeter screen and placed in artful clumps to suggest a natural landscape. The house was partly rebuilt by Robert Taylor (architect) for John Burgoyne in 1775 and by Robert Adam for the 12th Earl of Derby in 1790. The villa's bakehouse, stable block and some outbuildings remain to this day.|$|E

A short time later, Hornsbys sold the patent for the caterpillar track in 1914 to The Holt Manufacturing Company of California, USA for $8,000, having only sold one caterpillar tractor commercially. Hornsby's design was {{far ahead of}} anything else around at the time. Through ownership of the patent, this company became the successful Caterpillar Inc. Tractor Company. Benjamin Holt even {{claimed to be the}} real inventor. In December 1914 the British Army's Colonel Ernest Swinton saw one of Holt's caterpillar tractors towing a piece of artillery, and realised its potential as an attack vehicle. One year later the tank was born (using Hornsby's initial designs), being made in nearby Lincoln by William Foster. It first saw action at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916.|$|E
25|$|The Gators {{received}} the opening kickoff and ran {{it back to}} their own 25-yard line. After gaining four yards on three plays, Florida lined up to punt, {{but it was a}} fake and punter Bobby Joe Green ran 30 yards down to the LSU 41-yard line. The Gators went no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> on three more plays and this time they did punt, pinning LSU at its seven-yard line. From there LSU went three-and-out and Cannon punted down to near midfield. After making it into the LSU red zone, a missed field goal by the Gators gave the ball to LSU at its own 20. Again LSU picked up no yards on three plays and punted. At this point Dietzel sent in the Chinese Bandits, who forced a fumble on their first play on the field and recovered it at the LSU 45. Rabb then led the Tigers down to Florida's 6-yard line as the quarter ended. On the first play of the second quarter Florida was penalized for being offside, giving LSU a first down on the one. The Gators held at the goal-line for three straight runs up the middle, but on fourth down Cannon dove into the endzone for the first score of the game.|$|E
25|$|Erica Kane and Dimitri Marick {{fall in love}} {{while he}} is {{attempting}} a hostile takeover of her cosmetics company, Enchantment. They appear in a face-to-face meeting on TV's Market Street Week to debate. Afterwards, they meet privately and argue, at which point their animosity turns to passion and he pulls her into a kiss that she responds to. Their relationship cannot go <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> because he is married to Angelique Voynitzeva and {{she is in a}} loveless marriage to Adam Chandler. Dimitri pursues her despite these roadblocks. Erica turns down his advances, refusing to be anyone's mistress. Eventually he wears down her resistance and they begin an affair. He promises to divorce Angelique, but has a hard time doing so because she is not in the best of health. Once free of their spouses, Erica and Dimitri travel to Budapest in his native country, Hungary. While in Budapest, Erica is kidnapped twice. Once by Dimitri's estranged half brother, Edmund Grey, who wants to be acknowledged as a Marick. Then she is kidnapped by Helga, Angelique's mother, who wants to keep her daughter and Dimitri together. She locks Erica in Hugo Marick's crypt. Working together with Edmund, Dimitri rescues Erica and Helga falls to her death. Erica goes into a catatonic state requiring she be placed in Oak Haven, a mental institution in Pine Valley. Once Erica recovers, she and Dimitri plan to marry.|$|E

500|$|Ski flying {{endured a}} static era {{beginning}} in 1987, when Piotr Fijas set {{a world record}} of [...] in Planica. With height over the hills and inrun speeds {{at an all-time high}} (Pavel Ploc reached [...] off the table in Harrachov in 1983), as well as distances approaching , the FIS took a stance against record-hunting for safety reasons. From Felder's world record in 1986 onwards, the FIS implemented a rule in which distance points would not be awarded beyond 191m; the jump would still count, but no points <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> could be achieved. Per this rule, Fijas' jump was officially scaled down to 191m by the FIS, but the KOP group (led by the organisers in Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica) independently recorded the actual figure. Neither Kulm nor Planica would hold a ski flying event for several years, leaving Oberstdorf and Vikersund to host the Ski Flying World Championships in 1988 and 1990, respectively. At those events, world record distances and major incidents were avoided.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy's {{refusal to}} endorse Humphrey wavered {{somewhat}} by October, {{as the former}} candidate laid out conditions for the Democratic nominee. These included a shift in his stance on the Vietnam War, a change of the military draft, and a reform of the Democratic machine politics. Humphrey discussed the demands with McCarthy via telephone, and responded that he was [...] "not prone to start meeting conditions," [...] but that he is stating his [...] "own case" [...] as a candidate. At the end of October, McCarthy {{announced that he would}} vote for Humphrey, but would go no <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Nixon eventually won the election, and McCarthy received 20,721 write-in votes in California. and 2,751 in Arizona, where he was listed as the nominee of the anti-war New Party. McCarthy also ran for the Democratic nomination in 1972, but soon dropped out. He mounted an independent campaign in 1976 and received over 700,000 votes. During the 1980s, McCarthy was a supporter of the Reagan administration, and tried twice again for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 1992. He died on December 10, 2005 at the age of 89.|$|E

500|$|Stone Rollin expands on the Motown-inspired {{material}} of Saadiq's previous album and includes various other R styles. Along with mid-tempo soul songs, Stone Rollin features styles such as early R rock and roll, rock-inspired funk, Chess Records-blues, {{and the more}} expansive orchestral sound of post-Detroit Motown and 1970s Philadelphia soul. Disc jockey Chris Douridas described Saadiq's sound as [...] "a hybrid form that's rooted in these familiar elements from classic soul but recontextualized with a modern sound". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic called the album's songs [...] "belters" [...] and [...] "guitar-heavy", and wrote of its musical influences, [...] "While Prince informs the sound of this more than anybody, it's a very early-'70s sounding album on the whole [...] but there are influences that go back even <b>further</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> - Ray Charles and Little Richard in particular inform some of this record's more energetic moments." [...] Los Angeles Times journalist Mikael Wood said of the album's sound and production, [...] "Where Saadiq's previous efforts luxuriated in the layering and the fine-tuning made possible by modern recording gear, Stone Rollin presents a rawer, rowdier soul-rock sound modeled after his energetic stage show".|$|E
