500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] is a dance-pop {{and power}} pop song set {{to a house}} beat. It is {{composed}} in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade." [...] At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands [...] "Now Look at Me!", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, [...] "This is the Part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me." [...] As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: [...] "So {{you can keep the}} diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> <b>you</b> can keep everything Yeah/ Yeah Except for me". Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.|$|E

2500|$|In 1841 Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the {{daughter}} of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) {{were told by}} Ada's mother that her father was also Medora's father. On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: [...] "I am {{not in the least}} astonished. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>you</b> merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected." [...] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: [...] "I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was." [...] In the 1840s Ada flirted with scandals: first, from a relaxed relationship with men who were not her husband, which led to rumours of affairs—and secondly, her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than £3,000 on the horses during the later 1840s. The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband. She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her. During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.|$|E
