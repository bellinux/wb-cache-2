2500|$|Hackworth is {{believed}} to have been influential in the development of the first Stephenson locomotive intended for the Stockton and Darlington Railway during his time at the Forth Street factory. That locomotive, then named Active, now known as Locomotion No 1, was delivered to the railway just before the opening ceremony on 27 September 1825. Three more of the same type (Hope, Black Diamond, Diligence) were delivered in the following months and difficulties in getting them into operating order were such as to risk compromising the use of steam locomotives for years to come, had it not been for Hackworth's persistence. This persistence resulted in his developing the first adequate locomotive adapted to the rigours of everyday road service. The outcome was the Royal George [...] of 1827, an early 0-6-0 Locomotive, that among many new key features notably incorporated a correctly aligned steam blastpipe. Hackworth is usually acknowledged as the inventor of this concept. From 1830 onwards the blastpipe was employed by the Stephensons for their updated Rocket and all subsequent new types. Recent letters acquired by the National Railway Museum would appear to confirm Hackworth as the inventor of the device. Since Trevithick's time, it had long been common practice to turn the exhaust steam from the cylinders into the chimney using [...] "eductor pipes" [...] for convenience and noise reduction, and its effect on the fire certainly had been noticed. Whatever the case, Hackworth was probably the first engineer in history to fully take into account the role of the blast in automatically realising the [...] "perfect equilibrium between steam production and usage" [...] in a locomotive when fitted with a <b>firetube</b> boiler, and to consider the blastpipe as a distinct device, paying close attention to its proportions, nozzle size, positioning and precise alignment.|$|E

5000|$|Large steam {{locomotives}} {{usually have}} a combustion chamber in the boiler to allow the use of shorter <b>firetubes.</b> This is because: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Firetubes</b> are {{attached}} to one wall of the firebox (the front wall for a longitudinal boiler, the top for a vertical boiler) and carry the hot gaseous products of combustion through the boiler water, heating it, before they escape to the atmosphere. <b>Firetubes</b> serve the additional purpose of staying the flat tube (flue) sheets (front and rear) so that only {{the top of the}} front flue sheet and the bottom of the rear flue sheet must be separately braced.|$|R
50|$|The {{far end of}} {{the furnace}} is an {{enclosed}} box called the combustion chamber which extends upwards to link up with the <b>firetubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{weight and}} power and length increased, there were {{experiments}} with flexible boiler casings; from 1910 the Santa Fe road introduced 2-6-6-2 locomotives weighing 392,000 lb, with a 37 ft long boiler barrel, with a <b>firetube</b> reheater and a <b>firetube</b> feedwater section in front, each separated by a blank section, and variants of a telescopic or bellows type boiler casing. These were unsuccessful, and later engines used conventional boilers.|$|E
50|$|Fire-tube boiler with Water-tube firebox. Sometimes the two above types {{have been}} {{combined}} {{in the following}} manner: the firebox contains an assembly of water tubes, called thermic siphons. The gases then pass through a conventional <b>firetube</b> boiler. Water-tube fireboxes were installed in many Hungarian locomotives, but have met with little success in other countries.|$|E
50|$|Draught for <b>firetube</b> boilers, {{particularly}} in marine applications, is usually {{provided by a}} tall smokestack. In all steam locomotives since Stephenson's Rocket, additional draught is supplied by directing exhaust steam from the cylinders into the smokestack through a blastpipe, to provide a partial vacuum. Modern industrial boilers use fans to provide forced or induced draughting of the boiler.|$|E
5000|$|Long <b>firetubes</b> have a {{theoretical}} advantage {{in providing a}} large heating surface but, beyond a certain length, this is subject to diminishing returns.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} rare Fowler steam wagons used a boiler of this form. The main {{barrel of the}} boiler contained a nest of curved <b>firetubes</b> between the stayless firebox and a large open space that formed a smokebox containing a five-turn spiral tube superheater. Both tubeplates were domed inwards, making them strong enough to not require staying. The <b>firetubes</b> were curved to 'cause eddies in the hot gases as they rise', to allow for free expansion with heat and also to allow a perpendicular joint between tube and tubeplate.|$|R
50|$|By this time, the {{locomotive}} boiler had become ubiquitous for traction engines. Compared to this, {{the advantage of}} the Huber boiler was that the <b>firetubes</b> could be replaced more easily, without needing to work from within an enclosed firebox.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had {{a corridor}} tender and ran non-stop London-Edinburgh services {{to time in}} 1930; nevertheless steaming was relatively poor during test runs, {{and in spite of}} a number of modifications initially to the exhaust, boiler performance never reached the standards of an equivalent <b>firetube</b> boiler. A problem never fully solved was air leakage into the casing.|$|E
50|$|In a Stephensonian <b>firetube</b> {{locomotive}} boiler, this entails routing the {{saturated steam}} through small diameter pipes suspended inside large diameter firetubes {{putting them in}} contact with the hot gases exiting the firebox; the saturated steam flows backwards from the wet header towards the firebox, then forwards again to the dry header. Superheating only began to be generally adopted for locomotives around the year 1900 due to problems of overheating of and lubrication of the moving parts in the cylinders and steam chests.Many <b>firetube</b> boilers heat water until it boils, and then the steam is used at saturation temperature in other words the temperature of the boiling point of water at a given pressure (saturated steam); this still contains a large proportion of water in suspension. Saturated steam can and has been directly used by an engine, but as the suspended water cannot expand and do work and work implies temperature drop, much of the working fluid is wasted along with the fuel expended to produce it.|$|E
50|$|Although they {{appeared}} to have exceedingly long boilers, the barrel {{in front of the}} rear set of cylinders actually contained first a primitive <b>firetube</b> superheater for further heating the steam before use; the steam was carried forward from the boiler proper by outside steam pipes as shown in the photograph. Also in this space was a reheater for the high-pressure exhaust before it was fed to the forward low-pressure cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic of a later steam {{locomotive}} firebox boiler, with firebox {{to the left}} and indicatively showing two superheater elements to the right. These elements receive saturated (wet) steam from the boiler, add more heat to the steam in the superheater elements (hence the term [...] "super" [...] heated) which drys the steam, then discharges the superheated (dry) steam to the engine. The colours blue and red represent cooler and hotter water respectively. The colours dark and light green represent wet and dry steam respectively. The colours orange and yellow represent hot and cooler exhaust gas respectively. In the diagram three small diameter orange\yellow empty <b>firetubes</b> are indicated to the bottom with two larger diameter orange\yellow <b>firetubes</b> to the top that contain the superheater elements.|$|R

These solutions are generalized also to (1 + 3) -dimensional, cylindrically symmetric <b>firetubes,</b> corresponding to central collisions of heavy ions at relativistic bombarding energies...|$|R
50|$|Another major {{advance in}} the Rocket was large numbers of small-diameter <b>firetubes</b> (a multi-tubular boiler) instead of a single large flue. This greatly {{increased}} the surface area for heat transfer, allowing steam to be produced {{at a much higher}} rate. Without this, steam locomotives could never have developed effectively as powerful prime movers.|$|R
5000|$|The Baldwin 60000 {{prototype}} {{worked at}} a modest [...] and did not use either of the complex systems described above. It had a relatively conventional watertube firebox and a <b>firetube</b> boiler. Nevertheless, high maintenance costs and poor reliability more than cancelled the fuel economies promised by high-pressure and compounding, and the design was not repeated. Other relatively conventional high-pressure locomotives {{were built in the}} USA, including the remarkable triple-expansion L F Loree locomotive of 1933. None was successful.|$|E
50|$|While {{known as}} a , Clarkson is also {{a big fan of}} British engineering, and the Tornado project was an award-winning example of this (albeit {{incorporating}} a German-designed and -built <b>firetube</b> boiler).

5000|$|Many of {{the best-known}} names in model {{engineering}} are of those who wrote prolifically in the model engineering press. Henry Greenly {{may be the first}} notable model engineer, being founding editor of Model Railways and Locomotives Magazine in 1902 and author of Model Engineering and related books. Greenly produced a number of designs for spirit-fuelled model locomotives, which however could not haul passengers. Arguably the most notable model engineer of all was the obscure 'LBSC' (Lillian [...] "Curly" [...] Lawrence). His most significant contribution was to overturn Greenly's prevailing orthodoxy and demonstrate that model locomotives of even small gauge (2Â½") could be powerful enough to haul passengers, by using miniature coal-fired <b>firetube</b> boilers, as were used in full-size locomotives. From 1923 until his death in 1967 he popularized passenger-hauling miniature live steam locomotives that could be built with minimal equipment, by publishing over 50 locomotive designs in various gauges, serialized mostly in Model Engineer magazine.|$|E
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber {{was linked to}} the smokebox through a set of very short <b>firetubes.</b> Exhaust steam was re-condensed instead of escaping and fed back to the boiler. The locomotive was intended to operate conventionally in the open, but in tunnels dampers would be closed and steam would be generated using the stored heat from the fire bricks.|$|R
50|$|The normal {{arrangement}} involved taking steam {{after the}} regulator valve and passing it through long superheater tubes inside specially large <b>firetubes</b> of the boiler. The superheater tubes had a reverse ("torpedo") bend at the firebox end {{so that the}} steam had to pass {{the length of the}} boiler at least twice, picking up heat as it did so.|$|R
50|$|The {{immersion}} {{fired boiler}} is a single-pass fire-tube boiler {{that was developed}} by Sellers Engineering in the 1940s. It has only <b>firetubes,</b> functioning as a furnace and combustion chamber also, with multiple burner nozzles injecting premixed air and natural gas under pressure. It claims reduced thermal stresses, and lacks refractory brickwork completely due to its construction.|$|R
50|$|In September 1831, Cooper {{proposed}} building six locomotives {{based upon}} his own {{design for the}} B&O. The railroad agreed to his proposal, but when he failed to deliver on schedule, Cooper sold his patent to the B&O. Davis soon incorporated some of Cooperâ€™s ideas into an improvement on his York design. Aided by Ross Winans, Davis in 1832 constructed a second locomotive {{that proved to be}} far more commercially successful than his first. This was the Atlantic, which employed Cooper's vertical <b>firetube</b> boiler. Built at a cost of $4,500, Atlantic weighed 6.5 ST and had two vertical cylinders. Ox teams were used to convey the engine to Baltimore, where it made a successful inaugural trip to Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, a distance of thirteen miles. Nicknamed Grasshopper for its distinctive vertical pushrods, the locomotive carried 50 pounds of steam (3.45 bar) and burned a ton of anthracite coal on a 40 mi trip from Baltimore. Davisâ€™s 0-4-0 design proved reasonably successful, and 20 such locomotives were constructed at the B&O's Mount Clare Shops. Some operated for more than 60 years, and were finally retired in the 1890s. One was prominently exhibited at the New York Worldâ€™s Fair in 1939.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{standard}} steam locomotive <b>firetube</b> type boiler, the firebox {{is surrounded by}} water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the ash pan. A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} boiler of comparable form {{was used in}} a railway locomotive, Hackworth's [...] 'Wilberforce' [...] class of 1830. This had a long cylindrical boiler shell similar to his earlier return-flued [...] 'Royal George' , but with the return flue replaced {{by a number of}} small <b>firetubes,</b> as had been demonstrated so effectively by Stephenson with his [...] 'Rocket' [...] a year earlier. The novel feature of an entirely internal combustion chamber was used. Unlike the later Scotch boiler though, this was self-supported by its own stays, rather than using stays through the walls of the boiler shell. This allowed the entire assembly of outer tubeplate, furnace tube, combustion chamber and <b>firetubes</b> to all be removed from the boiler shell as one unit, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. Although a valuable feature, this became impractical for larger diameter chambers that would require the support of the shell.|$|R
50|$|The {{double-ended}} design places two boilers back-to-back, {{removing the}} rear {{wall of the}} boiler shell. The combustion chambers and <b>firetubes</b> remain separate. This design saves some structural weight, but it also makes the boiler longer {{and more difficult to}} install into a ship. For this reason they were not commonly used, although back-to-back arrangements of multiple single-ended boilers were common.|$|R
5000|$|In {{front of}} that, {{there was a}} {{feedwater}} heater, a space where cold water from the tender could be warmed before being injected into the water proper. This worked similarly to the boiler itself; the <b>firetubes</b> passed through the feedwater tank. The ATSF 2-10-10-2's, #3000 class locomotives, were the largest locomotives in the world from 1911 till possibly early 1914.|$|R
40|$|A steam energy {{tip sheet}} for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). The {{prevention}} of scale formation in <b>firetube</b> boilers {{can result in}} substantial energy savings. Scale deposits occur when calcium, magnesium, and silica, commonly found in most water supplies, react to form a continuous layer of material on the waterside of the boiler heat exchange tubes. Scale creates a problem because it typically possesses a thermal conductivity, {{an order of magnitude}} less than the corresponding value for bare steel. Even thin layers of scale serve as an effective insulator and retard heat transfer. The result is overheating of boiler tube metal, tube failures, and loss of energy efficiency. Fuel consumption may increase by up to 5 % in <b>firetube</b> boilers because of scale. The boilers steam production may be reduced if the firing rate cannot be increased to compensate for the decrease in combustion efficiency. Energy losses as a function of scale thickness and composition are given. Any scale in a boiler is undesirable. The {{best way to deal with}} scale is not to let it form in the first place. Prevent scale formation by: (1) Pretreating of boiler makeup water (using water softeners, demineralizers, and reverse osmosis to remove scale-forming minerals); (2) Injecting chemicals into the boiler feedwater; and (3) Adopting proper boiler blowdown practices...|$|E
40|$|Alzeta Corporation has {{developed}} various process heating applications using the Pyrocore burner. Applications to immersion fluid heating {{have been in}} use for several years. An advanced process heater is also being developed. These processes {{take advantage of the}} uniform radiant heating feature of the burner to produce compact, efficient equipment. In addition, the burner provides very low NOx emissions and none of the aerodynamic combustion noise associated with conventional flame burners. This paper describes these two applications: 1) <b>firetube</b> immersion heaters and 2) an advanced process heater to be installed at an oil reprocessing facility in Newark, California...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{hot water}} generator that combines direct water heating in a packed column and indirect water heating in a submerged combustion chamber {{is the subject}} of this investigation. Advantages of the heater over the conventional hot water generators include higher efficiency, lower cost of equipment, lower pressure drop, and a simpler control system. The experimental work has been conducted on a prototype dual water heater located at the Natural Gas Technology Center at Boucherville, Quebec. The heater consists of an immersed <b>firetube</b> and two packed columns. It provides hot water at two temperatures. The effects of the controlling parameters, such as the flow rates of the water, air, and fuel gas, on the performance of the heater were analyzed. Equations governing the heat and mass transfer were formulated. Simplified forms of these equations were used to determine heat and mass transfer coefficients...|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} brick arch (made from fire brick) {{attached}} to the front wall of the firebox immediately beneath the <b>firetubes.</b> This extends backwards over the front third to half of the firebed. It is supported on arch tubes, thermic syphons, or circulators. The brick arch directs heat, flames, and smoke back over the fire towards {{the rear of the}} firebox. Visible smoke contains unburned combustible carbon particles and combustible gasses. The purpose of this redirection is to cause more complete combustion of these particles and gasses which make the locomotive more efficient and causes less visible smoke to be emitted from the stack. Without the arch, flames and visible smoke would be sucked straight into the <b>firetubes</b> without having been fully burned, causing visible smoke to be emitted at the stack. The brick arch and its supports (arch tubes, thermic syphons, and circulators) require periodic replacement due to the extreme heat they endure.|$|R
50|$|Experiments at the North Midland's Derby Works showed {{temperatures}} {{as high as}} 773 F, {{determined by}} placing a small cup of zinc within the smokebox beneath the chimney. Stephenson extended the boiler, and hence the <b>firetubes,</b> from the usual nine feet to thirteen or fourteen feet. Placing tin in the smokebox, he found that it just began to melt, indicating a temperature of 442 F.|$|R
50|$|In the UK the {{specified}} maximum interval between full overhauls is ten years. To enable a full inspection the boiler is {{lifted from the}} locomotive frame and the lagging removed. All <b>firetubes</b> are removed for checking or replacement. All fittings are removed for overhaul. Before returning to use a qualified examiner will check the boilerâ€™s fitness for service and issue a safety certificate valid for ten years.|$|R
